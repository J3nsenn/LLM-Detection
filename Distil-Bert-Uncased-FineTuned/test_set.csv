10,"Dear State Senator,

I am writing to share my thoughts on the current debate surrounding the Electoral College system in the United States. As a 9th grade student, I have been studying the advantages and disadvantages of this system and its potential impact on our democracy. After careful consideration, I believe it is time to eliminate the Electoral College and switch to a popular vote system for presidential elections.

One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it protects the interests of smaller states and promotes federalism. However, in today's society, this argument is no longer relevant. The Electoral College was created in a time when communication and transportation were limited, and voters relied on their local representatives to make decisions for them. With the advancements in technology and social media, voters now have access to a wealth of information and can make informed decisions on their own.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system has been criticized for causing confusion and not always reflecting the popular vote. For example, in the 2000 election, Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency to George W. Bush because of the Electoral College system. This has led many to argue that the system is outdated, unfair, and can lead to issues like faithless electors or a tie in electoral votes, which would then be decided by Congress.

On the other hand, a popular vote system would ensure that the president is elected by the majority of the American people. This system would be fairer and more transparent, accurately representing the will of the people. It would also eliminate the possibility of faithless electors and ties in electoral votes, which could create political turmoil and undermine the election's legitimacy.

Some concerns about a popular vote system include potential recounts and the impact of third-party candidates. However, these concerns can be addressed through measures like ranked-choice voting and other electoral reforms. Ranked-choice voting, for instance, would allow voters to rank their preferred candidates, ensuring that the winner is chosen by a true majority. Additionally, reforms such as automatic voter registration and same-day voting could boost voter turnout and reduce the influence of special interest groups.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is time to do away with the Electoral College and adopt a popular vote system for U.S. presidential elections. This system would be more just, transparent, and reflective of the people's will. I urge you to consider these points and take steps to implement a popular vote system that would uphold the integrity and legitimacy of our democracy.

Sincerely,

29,"Hello, I'm just a typical 8th grader, but I'm going to do my best! Here is my essay on the potential advantages and disadvantages of high school graduation programs that only last three years instead of the usual four.

Some people believe that high school should be shortened to three years instead of four, and I can understand why. Four years is a long time, and some students may become bored or lose interest in school. However, there are also significant drawbacks to consider.

One benefit of a three-year high school program is that it would allow students more time to focus on their interests and passions. For example, they could take more advanced classes in a specific subject or even start a business or club. Having more time to explore their interests and incorporate them into their high school experience could be exciting.

Another advantage is that it could assist struggling students. With only three years of high school, students may have more time to catch up on their work or receive additional help from teachers. It could also benefit students who are ahead academically, as they could take more advanced classes and get a head start on their future endeavors.

However, there are also significant drawbacks to consider. One concern is that fitting all the necessary classes and credits into just three years could be challenging. Balancing a heavy course load with extracurricular activities and other commitments may be difficult, and students could miss out on important classes or activities if they don't plan their schedules carefully.

Additionally, students who are not as academically inclined may struggle with a shortened high school program. They may not have enough time to catch up or receive the necessary support. Similarly, students heavily involved in extracurricular activities may find it challenging to balance their commitments with a shorter high school timeline.

In conclusion, while a three-year high school graduation program may be an intriguing idea, there are certainly pros and cons to consider.",1

Similarly, if you come across as awkward or shy, they might perceive you as strange or unfriendly.

However, making a good first impression can make a significant difference in how people treat you. If you appear confident and friendly, others are more likely to be kind and want to spend time with you. On the other hand, if you come across as awkward or unfriendly, people may avoid you or treat you poorly.

I have personally experienced the impact of first impressions. Once, when I was new in class, I accidentally spilled things all over the floor. My teacher was annoyed with me at first, but after I cleaned up and apologized, she started treating me better and we even became friends.

Therefore, it is important to be patient when meeting someone for the first time. Avoid rushing to judgment of yourself or others. Take your time, be friendly and respectful, and things will usually work out fine.

57,"Dear Senator [Your Senator's Name],

I am writing to suggest a discussion about the process of electing the President of the United States. The main question is whether we should stick with the current Electoral College system or move towards a direct popular vote.

The Electoral College, established by our founding fathers, is a key part of our democratic process outlined in the Constitution. It involves electors from each state voting in line with their state's popular vote. While it provides certainty in election outcomes and ensures every state has a say in the President's choice, it also has drawbacks. Electors can ignore the popular vote, potentially disenfranchising voters, and the winner-takes-all system may neglect the interests of residents in ""safe"" states.

There are arguments for and against keeping the Electoral College. Some believe it is an unfair and outdated system, while others see its benefits. I suggest exploring gradual reform, like the proportional representation system used in Maine and Nebraska, to better reflect the popular vote while maintaining the positive aspects of the current system.

No system is perfect, but progress comes from continuous improvement. I urge you to consider discussing reforming the Electoral College system in the Senate.

Thank you for your time and dedication to our state and country.

For creative or focused tasks, working independently may be more effective. For tasks requiring collaboration and brainstorming, working in a group is likely the better option. Thank you for taking the time to read my essay, Mrs. Johnson!",1
101,"I do not agree with the principal's decision to make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While these activities can be helpful, students should have the freedom to choose how they spend their time outside of class. There are several reasons for my stance: Some students may not feel comfortable in group settings and prefer individual hobbies. Forcing them to join a club or team could cause unnecessary stress and take away from their enjoyment of middle school. Additionally, not all students have the same family and work responsibilities, so requiring extracurricular participation could burden those with limited free time. Furthermore, not every activity will appeal to every student, and limiting their options to only what the school provides may discourage them from getting involved in the future. Students should have the autonomy to decide how they spend their nonacademic hours, as this independence is crucial for their development. While extracurriculars offer benefits, such as learning time management and making new friends, participation should not be mandatory. Requiring involvement could damage motivation for the sake of participation alone. Ultimately, the decision to participate in extracurricular activities should be left up to each individual student and their family based on their needs and interests.",1
102,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my concerns about the Electoral College and to advocate for a national popular vote for the President of the United States.

The Electoral College, created in the 18th century as a compromise, is outdated and does not accurately represent the will of the people. Recent elections have shown that the candidate who wins the popular vote may not necessarily win the presidency, as was the case in the 2016 election. This system also gives more power to voters in small states and neglects voters in non-swing states.

I believe that the Electoral College is undemocratic and should be eliminated in favor of a national popular vote. I urge you to support this change.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

103,"Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to share my thoughts on the Electoral College and advocate for its retention as the method of selecting the President of the United States. While there are valid concerns about the fairness and shortcomings of the Electoral College, I believe it offers important advantages for our democracy.

To begin with, the Electoral College ensures a clear outcome in the event of a dispute, reducing the likelihood of challenges compared to a direct popular vote. This was evident in the 2012 election when President Obama won a larger share of the electoral vote despite receiving a smaller share of the popular vote, avoiding the complications of an electoral tie and a potential runoff election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to appeal to a broad range of regions and communities, rather than focusing solely on populous areas or swing states. This promotes a national campaign strategy that ensures candidates represent the entire nation, addressing the needs and interests of all citizens.

Additionally, the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to target swing states, which play a crucial role in determining the election outcome. By giving weight to the concerns of swing state voters, the Electoral College ensures that the election is decided by those who are most engaged and informed.

Moreover, the Electoral College balances the political influence of large and small states, preventing candidates from catering only to highly populous states. This maintains equality and fairness among states, ensuring that all regions have a voice in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections, which could complicate the electoral process and undermine the stability of our democratic system. By consistently producing a clear winner, the Electoral College avoids the uncertainties that can arise from a popular vote system.

While there are critics calling for the abolition of the Electoral College, I firmly believe it serves as a safeguard for our democracy. It promotes national representation, encourages candidates to engage with diverse regions, and avoids the complications of a direct popular vote system.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue. I urge you to carefully evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the Electoral College before making any decisions that could impact our democratic process.

Sincerely,

104,"When seeking advice, it is common for people to consult various sources to gain a well-rounded perspective. While this can be helpful, it may also lead to confusion and uncertainty. It is crucial to consider the opinions of others alongside our own thoughts and intuition in order to make informed decisions.

One effective approach is to seek guidance from trusted adults who have relevant experience and knowledge. These individuals can offer valuable insights to assist us in the decision-making process. It is also important to trust our instincts and carefully evaluate the potential consequences of each option.

Ultimately, the final decision rests with us. We must take ownership of our choices and carefully consider the possible outcomes before reaching a conclusion. While seeking advice from others is important, it is equally vital to have confidence in our own judgment and make decisions that align with our values and beliefs.

In conclusion, while seeking advice from multiple sources can be beneficial, it is essential to balance external opinions with our own intuition. Trusting our judgment and making decisions that reflect our values and beliefs are key to making the best choices for ourselves.",1
105,"As an eighth-grade student, I wanted to share my thoughts on your prompt. I may not be the strongest writer, so I apologize for any errors. When faced with a decision, it can be overwhelming to know what to do. That's why it's beneficial to gather various opinions. Hearing different viewpoints can assist in making a more informed decision.

For instance, if you're deciding on which college to attend, solely relying on one person's advice, like your mom, may be biased. By also consulting a career counselor, guidance counselor, or a friend, you can weigh the pros and cons of each college more effectively. This diverse input can lead to a better decision-making process.

I recall a time when I had to choose between two clubs - one focused on music and the other on sports. My music-loving dad recommended the music club, while my gym teacher, who knew my active nature, suggested the sports club. Considering both perspectives helped me choose the sports club, which I ultimately enjoyed.

Seeking multiple opinions allows for a broader understanding of a situation and helps in making a well-rounded decision by considering all possibilities.",1
106,"Summer projects are an essential aspect of the academic year for students, providing them with the opportunity to apply their classroom knowledge to real-world problems. There is a debate over whether these projects should be designed by students or teachers. In this essay, I will argue that student-designed projects are more beneficial.

Firstly, student-designed projects allow students to have control over their learning, leading to increased motivation and engagement. Students can choose projects that align with their interests, making the learning experience more enjoyable and meaningful. In contrast, teacher-designed projects may not always cater to students' interests, resulting in a lack of motivation.

Secondly, student-designed projects encourage critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Students must think creatively to solve real-world problems, fostering skills such as problem-solving and creativity. Teacher-designed projects may not challenge students to think as deeply or creatively.

Additionally, student-designed projects help students develop important life skills such as independence, time management, and collaboration. These skills are crucial for success in the future. Teacher-designed projects may not offer the same level of autonomy and responsibility.

Lastly, student-designed projects can lead to more innovative solutions. Students are more likely to come up with unique ideas when given the freedom to design their projects. This can result in new discoveries that may not have been possible with teacher-designed projects.

In conclusion, student-designed summer projects are more beneficial as they allow students to take ownership of their learning, promote critical thinking and problem-solving, develop important life skills, and lead to more innovative solutions.",1

108,"I do not agree with the principal's decision to make extracurricular activities mandatory for all students. While these activities can be valuable, they should be optional rather than required. Forcing students to participate takes away their autonomy and does not consider their individual priorities and circumstances. Not all students have the time or interest to take on additional commitments outside of their academic studies. Some may have other responsibilities or prefer to focus on their schoolwork. Mandatory participation does not lead to genuine passion or skill development. It also does not cater to the diverse talents and interests of students. By making extracurricular activities compulsory, students are not able to explore and develop their unique skills. This could also overwhelm students who are already struggling to balance their schoolwork with other obligations. Exceptions should be made to accommodate individual circumstances. In conclusion, students benefit most from extracurricular activities that they choose to participate in voluntarily, based on their own interests and motivations. Flexibility and exceptions are necessary to support each student's needs and maximize their potential for success. Ultimately, optional extracurricular programs are more effective for student development than mandatory ones.",1

110,"Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am reaching out as a concerned citizen of [State Name] to address the ongoing debate between the Electoral College and popular vote in our national Democratic process. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages. The Electoral College, established by our founding fathers, ensures representation across states based on congressional delegation size. However, the popular vote system could provide equal stake for all Americans in presidential elections, avoiding situations where a candidate wins the popular vote but loses the presidency.

Critics argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic, focusing candidates' attention on swing states and potentially discouraging voters in partisan states. Concerns also arise about potential malfunctions leading to uncertainty. Transitioning to a popular vote system could introduce challenges such as runoffs and favoring urban areas over rural regions.

Despite these criticisms, the Electoral College provides certainty, encourages candidates to appeal beyond regional boundaries, and engages voters in swing states. It also balances representation between larger and smaller states.

In conclusion, while the debate is complex, it is clear that both systems have unique features that uphold democratic principles. It may be beneficial to explore reforms that combine the strengths of both methods, such as proportional representation. As a dedicated public servant, I trust that you share the goal of implementing the fairest and most effective system. I urge you to engage in informed discourse on this issue to find a solution that benefits our democracy.

While some may argue that using cars is convenient and represents freedom, the evidence suggests otherwise. By examining the effects of car usage on air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and traffic congestion, we can see the advantages of reducing car usage. Firstly, cars significantly contribute to air pollution in urban areas, leading to health issues and premature deaths. Secondly, cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. Lastly, car usage causes traffic congestion, which has negative economic and social impacts.

112,"The concept of driverless cars has sparked much debate and excitement recently. However, upon closer examination of this emerging technology, it becomes evident that there are notable disadvantages to this futuristic concept. This essay will argue against the adoption of driverless cars, citing issues with current technology limitations, privacy concerns, and economic and infrastructure challenges as outlined in the article.

The current technology limitations present a major obstacle to the widespread use of driverless cars. While advancements have been made, these vehicles struggle to handle complex driving situations at higher speeds. They are reliable for basic functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but beyond that, their performance is lacking. This raises doubts about their practicality - if a driver still needs to be actively involved, can these cars truly be considered driverless? Additionally, the idea of installing cameras to monitor drivers raises serious privacy concerns. The notion of constant surveillance by a manufacturer is unsettling for many and could lead to increased stress and distracted driving. Traditional cars, without such monitoring, have generally performed well, calling into question the necessity of this feature in driverless cars.

The economic implications of transitioning to driverless cars are significant. These vehicles require compatible infrastructure, such as 'smart roads' that can communicate with them. The cost of implementing such upgrades would be extremely high, and it is unclear who would bear these expenses. Furthermore, these smart roads would need to be universally compatible with all types of vehicles, both driverless and traditional. The logistical and financial challenges of such a transition are daunting. The feasibility of such a shift is uncertain, and the associated costs are likely too steep to justify the adoption of driverless cars.

Ultimately, the focus should be on practical solutions to current issues rather than pushing for a futuristic ideal. The driverless car revolution appears more like an unnecessary leap rather than a necessary advancement in automotive technology. Resources would be better spent refining existing technologies to address present problems like traffic congestion and road safety.

In conclusion, while driverless cars represent an impressive technological achievement, their current state falls short in many aspects. The limitations of current technology, privacy concerns, and economic and infrastructure challenges present significant obstacles to the widespread use of driverless cars. Rather than pursuing this futuristic ideal, efforts should be directed towards practical solutions for current issues. At present, the driverless car revolution seems more like an unnecessary leap rather than a crucial advancement in automotive technology.",1

114,"Homework Club: The Ultimate Study Partner

As an 8th grader, the burden of homework weighs heavily on me every night. It feels like no matter how much I accomplish, there is always more to do. That's why I believe a homework club at school could make a significant difference. Just imagine having a designated time and place to work on assignments with classmates, free from classroom distractions and the pressure of finishing alone at home. It may sound too good to be true, but let me explain why it's not.

Primarily, a homework club would allow us to spend more quality time with our families and friends. My parents worry when they see me spending hours on homework each night, and I know they would appreciate it if I could finish earlier. Additionally, I would have more time to socialize with friends and engage in activities I enjoy, such as going to the movies. Who doesn't love a fun movie night?

However, the benefits of a homework club extend beyond just having more free time. Collaborating with a peer in a homework club can enhance our understanding of the material. By working together, we can explain concepts to each other and provide assistance when one of us is stuck. It's like having a built-in study group, minus the distractions of a noisy library or the pressure of a test. Plus, learning with a friend by your side is always more enjoyable!

While some may argue that playing video games is a more enjoyable way to spend free time, it's important to consider the negative effects they can have. Video games can lead to violence, social isolation, and addiction. In contrast, a homework club offers a healthy way to spend our time, benefiting us mentally and socially.

Of course, there may be some drawbacks to a homework club. Some students may not be interested in attending, or they may not be able to make it every week. However, I believe these are minor sacrifices compared to the benefits.",1
115,"When it comes to learning, students should focus on grasping ideas and concepts rather than just memorizing facts.

The act of spreading kindness can have a significant impact on the world by inspiring others to do the same, reducing negative behaviors, and improving overall well-being. Kindness can also lead to success in personal and professional endeavors, opening doors to opportunities and positive outcomes.

While kindness may not come naturally to everyone, it is important to make a conscious effort to show kindness in various ways, no matter how small. Ultimately, kindness is a valuable asset in life that can improve relationships, build community, and make a positive difference in the world. It is crucial to prioritize kindness as a guiding principle in our lives.",1
117,"Of course, I will give it a shot! Here is my essay on the factors that students take into consideration when deciding to participate in extracurricular activities:

Hello! So, you are aware of the numerous activities available both in and out of school, such as sports, clubs, volunteer work, and more, right? Well, I am going to discuss the factors that influence my decision when contemplating joining something.

Initially, I consider the amount of time it will require. While some clubs may be enjoyable, I want to ensure that it is worth dedicating my free time to. Therefore, I assess how much time I will need to commit and if it is worth sacrificing other activities.

Another aspect I ponder is how it will enhance my college applications. Although it may seem superficial, colleges do consider extracurricular involvement. Hence, if I am investing a significant amount of time, I want it to reflect positively on my applications. For instance, holding a leadership position in a club is more favorable than just being a member.

Furthermore, I contemplate how it will benefit me in the long term. Joining a club related to my future aspirations will be more advantageous than joining something random. Additionally, being involved in something I am genuinely interested in will increase my motivation to excel.

However, sometimes I simply want to participate in something because it is enjoyable. For example, I love playing soccer, so I joined the soccer team purely for the enjoyment it brings, without considering its impact on college applications. Therefore, I strive to find a balance between activities I do for fun and those that will enhance my applications.

In conclusion, it is crucial to consider various factors when deciding to participate in extracurricular activities.",1

119,"Hello! I was given an assignment to write about Winston Churchill's quote ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" and it really got me thinking. I have definitely failed at things before, like when I tried to make a volcano in science class and it turned out to be more like a small puddle of bubbly goo. But I didn't let that discourage me! I learned from my mistake and kept trying.

I believe this quote is important because it emphasizes that success is not just about avoiding failure, but about how you respond to those failures. If you let setbacks bring you down, you will give up too easily. But if you keep going and learning, you will improve. I faced tough exams in math class, but I didn't let that discourage me. I studied hard until I achieved the grade I wanted, and it paid off.

This quote also reminds me that it's okay to make mistakes. We all make them, but it's important to learn from them. Instead of getting upset, we should see mistakes as opportunities to learn and grow. By using that knowledge, we can do better next time.

I believe this quote is important for others as well, as it shows that everyone experiences failure at some point. By persevering and learning from those failures, they too can achieve success. The more you fail, the closer you are to success. Who wouldn't want that?

So, that's my essay. I hope you enjoyed it.",1

Trying to fit in and be like everyone else is futile, as people will always treat you poorly regardless. It is better to be genuine and find happiness within oneself. Embracing one's cultural heritage is also crucial, as denying one's roots can lead to a sense of disconnection and loss of identity.

Furthermore, it is unhealthy to belittle others in order to feel superior. Instead, focusing on personal growth and development is a more positive and productive way to live. By staying true to oneself, embracing cultural heritage, and avoiding harmful behaviors, we can create a more authentic and harmonious society.",1
122,"Never give up when striving for success, even if you face initial setbacks. Winston Churchill once said that success is not permanent and failure is not fatal; what truly matters is having the courage to persevere. I believe in this sentiment because achieving success often demands persistence and resilience, necessitating continued efforts even in the face of adversity.

However, success is not solely about persistence; it also involves taking proactive steps and making deliberate efforts towards your objectives. Failure is not always a prerequisite for success; some individuals achieve their goals by taking calculated risks and making wise choices.

Maintaining enthusiasm and motivation while working diligently towards your goals is essential, as it helps you stay focused and driven. Enthusiasm can be a powerful motivator, enabling you to overcome obstacles and remain dedicated to your aspirations.

Furthermore, success requires being proactive and seizing control of your own destiny. Rather than waiting for success to come to you, you must actively pursue it by setting clear goals, taking decisive actions, and being open to learning from your mistakes.

In summary, Churchill's words ring true: ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" I concur with this sentiment as achieving success often demands persistence and resilience, but it also necessitates proactive action, enthusiasm, and a willingness to learn from setbacks.",1
123,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to share my views on the Electoral College. I believe that the Electoral College is an antiquated and undemocratic system that should be done away with.

The Electoral College was established in the 18th century when the United States was a very different place. Back then, communication and travel were much slower, making it challenging for people in different regions to stay informed about national affairs. The Electoral College was created to ensure that all states had a say in electing the president.

However, in today's world of instant communication and travel, the Electoral College is no longer necessary. It actually hinders our democracy rather than helping it.

The Electoral College is undemocratic because it gives more weight to some votes over others. Each state is allocated a certain number of electoral votes based on its representation in Congress, which means that a vote in a small state carries more weight than a vote in a large state. This imbalance is unfair to voters in larger states.

Additionally, the Electoral College can result in a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the election, as seen in five instances in American history, most recently in 2016. This undermines the legitimacy of the presidency and goes against the principle of democracy.

For these reasons, I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be eliminated. It is an outdated and undemocratic system that no longer serves a purpose. It is time for us to elect our president through a popular vote.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

However, the constant connectivity may be affecting the depth of our relationships. While modern communication allows for easier connection, it can also lead to superficial friendships lacking commitment. On the other hand, technology can be a lifeline for those who struggle with face-to-face interactions. Ultimately, technology's impact on social interaction is not entirely negative or positive, but rather a mix of both. Meaningful connections still require effort beyond digital communication, as relying solely on technology may limit the depth of relationships.",1
125,"The rapid advancement of technology has significantly changed the way people interact with each other. With the convenience of online shopping, entertainment, and communication, individuals can now complete various tasks without even leaving their homes. While this may appear to be a positive development, I believe that the lack of human contact resulting from technology has adverse effects on people's lives.

To begin with, isolation from others can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression, as individuals miss out on opportunities to meet new people, reconnect with old friends, and form meaningful relationships. This can result in a decrease in self-esteem and a sense of disconnection from the world around them. Research has shown that individuals who spend excessive time on technology are at a higher risk of developing mental health issues.

Moreover, the excessive use of technology can promote a sedentary lifestyle, with people more likely to spend their time sitting in front of screens rather than engaging in physical activity. This can lead to various health problems such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Additionally, the lack of physical activity can also result in a decline in social skills and empathy towards others.

Lastly, technology can have a negative impact on the environment, as the production and disposal of electronic devices contribute to pollution and resource depletion. Furthermore, the constant use of technology can diminish face-to-face communication, leading to a breakdown in communication and collaboration.

In conclusion, while technology offers numerous benefits, it is essential to acknowledge the negative effects it can have on individuals' lives. Finding a balance between using technology and engaging in meaningful human interaction is crucial. It is important to spend more time outdoors, connecting with others, and appreciating the world around us. Only then can we truly enjoy the advantages of technology and its role in our lives.",1
126,"Homework clubs, a concept that has been gaining popularity in schools recently, have the potential to offer numerous benefits for students. While some may argue that homework clubs are just a passing trend, the advantages they provide are undeniable. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of homework clubs, including the availability of teachers, student engagement, and their impact on mental health.

One of the main benefits of homework clubs is the chance for students to receive personalized attention and support from teachers. In a traditional classroom setting, teachers often have to divide their attention among many students, making it challenging to offer individualized help. Homework clubs, on the other hand, allow teachers to focus on a smaller group of students, enabling them to provide more targeted support and feedback. This can lead to improved academic performance and increased confidence in students.

Another advantage of homework clubs is the flexibility they provide. Unlike traditional homework, which is often assigned on a set schedule, homework clubs allow students to work on their assignments at their own pace. This can be particularly beneficial for students who struggle with time management or have other responsibilities outside of school. Homework clubs also offer a structured environment for students to work on their assignments, helping them stay on track and avoid procrastination.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to homework clubs. One of the main concerns is the possibility of distractions. When students work in a group, it can be easy for them to get distracted by their peers or lose focus on their assignments. Additionally, some students may not take their homework club responsibilities seriously, leading to a lack of productivity and progress.

Another factor to consider is the availability of teachers. While homework clubs can provide individualized attention, they may not always be able to accommodate every student who needs help. Teachers may have to prioritize their availability based on the needs of the students, potentially leaving some students behind.

Despite these potential drawbacks, homework clubs can have a positive impact on student engagement and mental health. When students have the opportunity to work on their assignments in a structured environment, they are more likely to feel engaged and motivated.",1
127,"The belief that first impressions are extremely difficult to change is commonly held, but not entirely accurate. While altering initial perceptions can be challenging, it is not impossible. This essay will argue that various factors can influence first impressions and with effort and awareness, they can be changed.

First impressions are quickly formed based on appearance, body language, and tone of voice, and can be influenced by personal biases and past experiences. However, these initial perceptions are not always accurate and can be swayed by external factors unrelated to a person's true character.

Changing a first impression can be tough as people tend to rely on their initial judgments when forming subsequent opinions. However, actively countering negative biases, getting to know the person better, and challenging negative thoughts can help in changing initial perceptions.

It is crucial to understand that first impressions do not always reflect a person's true self as individuals can evolve over time. Approaching first impressions with an open mind and being willing to reassess them as new information arises is important.

In conclusion, while changing first impressions may be challenging, it is not impossible. By being aware of the factors influencing initial perceptions and actively working to counter negative biases, more accurate and positive impressions can be formed. It is also essential to remember that first impressions do not always reflect a person's true character and to approach them with an open mind. Ultimately, by being conscious of our first impressions and willing to change them when necessary, more meaningful and positive relationships can be established.",1
128,"The Face on Mars is a natural landform that has sparked debate and speculation since it was first photographed by the Viking orbiter in 1976. Some believe it is evidence of an ancient Martian civilization, but further analysis suggests it is simply a naturally occurring formation and not created by aliens. Evidence supporting this includes the partial appearance of the face, with only some features clearly defined and others blending into the surrounding terrain. Similar formations on Earth, like the Obama rock formation in Hawaii, also resemble faces but are the result of natural erosion rather than intentional construction. The scale of the face on Mars, at 1.5 miles wide, would have been a massive engineering feat for any civilization, making it unlikely to be artificially built without any other signs of civilization nearby. Higher resolution images have failed to uncover any other constructed structures or artifacts near the face, further supporting the natural geological explanation. In conclusion, the Face on Mars is most likely a product of natural geological processes, rather than a remnant of an ancient civilization.",1
129,"As an 8th grader, I have been tasked with researching the advantages and disadvantages of attending school in person versus taking classes online or through video conferencing. Initially, I thought it would be straightforward to present the facts, but as I delved deeper, I realized there are numerous perspectives and experiences to consider.

One of the main benefits of attending school is the opportunity for social interaction and face-to-face communication with teachers and peers. In a physical classroom, nonverbal cues can be read and relationships can be built more easily. For example, my friend Sarah, who opted for online classes last semester, felt she missed out on group work and class discussions, which she considered important learning opportunities.

On the other hand, some individuals may prefer online classes for the flexibility it offers in terms of pace and environment. This can be particularly beneficial for students with busy schedules or those who struggle to focus in a traditional classroom. For instance, my cousin Alex appreciates the freedom of online classes as he can take breaks as needed and work on assignments at his own convenience.

Another crucial aspect to consider is the impact of attending school on students' mental and physical well-being. Studies have shown that regular school attendance is linked to better mental health and overall wellness. School provides structure and a sense of belonging, which is especially valuable for students dealing with anxiety or depression. However, attending school can also be physically demanding, especially for those with long commutes or disabilities that pose challenges in a traditional classroom setting.

It is important to acknowledge the unique challenges faced by immigrant students in attending school. Language barriers and cultural differences can hinder their success in a traditional classroom, making programs like ESOL essential. These programs offer additional support and resources to help immigrant students thrive academically.

In conclusion, attending school presents both advantages and obstacles that should be carefully considered when weighing the options for education.",1

However, the way in which praise is given can have varying effects, both positive and negative. Those who offer praise can be seen as heroes or leaders, but they may also use praise as a means of self-expression or to avoid dealing with their own emotional pain.

Praise can serve as a way to gain recognition and status in society. For instance, individuals like firefighters and police officers who demonstrate bravery and heroism in their actions are often praised for their efforts. Similarly, everyday acts of kindness, such as offering assistance or providing a ride to someone in need, can also be deserving of praise for their generosity.

Furthermore, praise can be utilized as a tool for boosting self-esteem. Individuals with low self-esteem may use praise as a way to release pent-up emotions or to distract themselves from personal struggles. It is important to note, however, that praise should not be a substitute for professional therapy or other forms of self-care.

138,"Dear State Senator,

I am writing to share my views on the contentious issue of the Electoral College. As a 9th grade student, I have been studying the advantages and disadvantages of this system and I believe it is time for a revision.

The Electoral College has been criticized for its potential to create confusion and for not always aligning with the popular vote. The 2000 election serves as a clear example of this discrepancy when the candidate who won the popular vote did not secure the presidency. Originally designed to safeguard state interests and federalism, this system is now outdated.

Supporters of the Electoral College argue that it protects the interests of smaller states, but this argument is becoming less convincing. With the abundance of information and technology available today, relying on electors to make decisions for us is no longer necessary. Direct elections would be a fairer and more transparent approach, accurately reflecting the will of the people.

Additionally, the origins of the Electoral College are rooted in concessions to slaveholders and assumptions about public information access that are no longer applicable. It is time to move away from this antiquated system and towards a method that truly represents the voices of the people.

I understand the concerns about potential recounts and third-party candidates in direct elections. However, I believe these issues can be addressed through practical solutions. For example, implementing a more efficient and secure voting system can prevent recounts, and providing more opportunities for third-party candidates to participate can enhance the electoral process.

In conclusion, I strongly advocate for a change in our electoral system. The Electoral College no longer fulfills its intended purpose and direct elections would offer a more equitable and accurate representation of the popular will. I urge you to consider the advantages of direct elections and take steps towards implementing this change.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

154,"Subject: Support for Maintaining the Electoral College System

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my endorsement of keeping the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While some advocate for a shift to popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democracy by ensuring fair representation, regional balance, stability, and eliminating the necessity for runoff elections.

The Electoral College guarantees a clear outcome, reducing the likelihood of disputes and controversies. It fosters national unity by requiring candidates to have broad appeal across regions. Additionally, it encourages candidates to focus on swing states, prioritizing diverse perspectives and issues. The system also balances the political influence of large states and avoids the need for runoff elections, simplifying the election process.

Critics argue that the Electoral College disenfranchises voters in certain states, but voter turnout data suggests that voters are motivated by expressing their preferences rather than swinging the national result. Dismantling the Electoral College would shift campaign strategies to densely populated areas, silencing the voices of less populous states and rural Americans.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a vital part of our democratic process, ensuring fairness, balance, and stability in presidential elections. I urge you to continue supporting the preservation of the Electoral College, honoring the compromise established by our founding fathers in the Constitution.

Thank you for your attention.

157,"Dear State Senator,

I am writing to share my thoughts on the Electoral College system in the United States. As a high school student, I have been studying the advantages and disadvantages of this system and believe it is important to consider both the Electoral College and popular vote systems.

It promotes coalition-building and compromise among regions, leading to diverse leadership. However, critics argue that it can result in the popular vote winner losing the presidency, raising concerns about election legitimacy.

Switching to a popular vote system may not solve these issues, as it could give too much power to urban areas and increase the influence of special interest groups. Instead of completely changing systems, I suggest reforms to the Electoral College to address fairness and representation concerns. For example, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact ensures the president is elected by the candidate with the most popular votes nationwide while maintaining the Electoral College.

159,"As an eighth-grade student, I support the idea of having a four-day school week at my school. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this schedule and argue in favor of it.

To begin with, a four-day school week would give students more time to concentrate on their studies. With four school days, students would have extra time to complete their work and get ready for exams. This would help reduce the stress students feel from having too much work to do in a short period. Additionally, students would have more time to participate in extracurricular activities like sports or clubs, allowing them to develop new skills and interests outside of the classroom.

162,"Dear State Senator,

I am writing to share my support for the Electoral College system used in the election of the President of the United States. While some believe the system is outdated and unjust, I believe it plays a crucial role in our democratic process.

One key argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it requires candidates to have broad support across the country, rather than just winning a few heavily populated areas. This ensures that candidates must appeal to a diverse range of voters, as noted by Bradford Plume in his article ""BHE Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses are wrong."" The winner-take-all system in each state also encourages candidates to focus on swing states, rather than neglecting other regions (Source 3).

Additionally, the Electoral College provides a more accurate reflection of the popular vote, as highlighted by Judge Richard A. Poster in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President."" This was evident in the 2000 election, where Al Gore won the popular vote but George W. Bush secured the presidency by winning the electoral vote.

181,"Dear [State Senator],

I am writing to share my views on the Electoral College system used for electing the President of the United States. While some believe that the Electoral College is outdated and unjust, I believe it remains a crucial aspect of our democratic process.

One key argument in support of the Electoral College is that it helps to provide a more accurate representation of the popular vote. According to Bradford Plume's article ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" the winner-take-all system in most states can lead candidates to focus their efforts on swing states where the vote is close, potentially resulting in a candidate winning the presidency despite losing the popular vote. In contrast, the Electoral College ensures that each state's vote carries equal weight, regardless of its population.

Another argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to appeal to a broader audience beyond their regional base. As Judge Richard A. Poster explains in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" the winner-take-all system can incentivize candidates to heavily campaign in states where they are likely to win, as they do not gain any additional electoral votes by increasing their lead in those states. This necessitates candidates to have a national appeal to succeed.

Critics of the Electoral College argue that it is undemocratic and unfair, as it can result in a candidate winning the presidency without winning the most popular votes. However, as Judge Poster points out, this is a rare occurrence, and the Electoral College ensures that a candidate must have a broad appeal beyond their regional base to be successful.

Moreover, the Electoral College system has been in place for a long time and has been a crucial aspect of our electoral process.",1

183,"Title: The Face on Mars: A Natural Geological Formation

Introduction:
Throughout history, humans have been intrigued by the mysteries of the universe and the potential for life beyond Earth. The search for extraterrestrial life has led to many discoveries, but sometimes our eagerness to find meaning can lead us astray. The Face on Mars was initially believed to be a structure created by aliens, but further investigation has revealed it to be a natural geological formation. As a NASA scientist, I will argue that the Face on Mars is not man-made, but rather a product of the planet's geological processes.

Arguments supporting the natural formation theory:

1. The Face is not unique: The Cydonia region of Mars contains several mesa-like formations similar in shape and size to the Face, indicating they are all natural geological structures formed by the same processes.
2. Geological context: The Face is situated near a potential ancient Martian ocean boundary, consistent with its natural origins. The area shows signs of past water activity, suggesting the Face was created through natural erosion processes.
3. Lack of artificial features: The Face does not exhibit symmetry or other artificial elements that would be expected in a constructed structure. Images from the Mars Global Surveyor show it to be a natural, irregular shape.
4. Scientific data: Laser altimetry data confirmed the natural origins of the Face, providing conclusive evidence along with images from the Mars Global Surveyor.

Evidence from the article supporting these arguments:

1. The article mentions that the Face was initially thought to be an unusual rock formation, but further analysis revealed its natural origins.
2. NASA prioritized photographing Cydonia with the Mars Global Surveyor in 1997, indicating a scientific interest in exploring the Face.
3. Images from the Mars Global Surveyor revealed the Face to be a natural landform, disappointing those who believed it to be of alien origin.
4. The Face is part of a larger geological feature at a potential ancient Martian ocean boundary, supporting the idea of its natural formation.

Conclusion:
The Face on Mars is a natural geological structure shaped by the planet's geological processes. Scientific data and evidence from the Mars Global Surveyor confirm its natural origins. It is important to approach such discoveries with a critical and evidence-based perspective, rather than relying on imagination or desire for meaning. The exploration of the Face on Mars will continue to enhance our understanding of the Red Planet and its history.",1

187,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to advocate for replacing the Electoral College system with a popular vote system for electing the president. While the Electoral College was intended to give smaller states more influence, I believe a popular vote system would be more democratic and in line with our nation's values.

One argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to campaign in more states. However, research shows that campaigns focus mainly on swing states, neglecting the majority of the country. A popular vote system could lead to candidates addressing a wider range of viewpoints nationwide.

Some argue that the Electoral College maintains the federal character of our system and state power. However, a popular vote system may better reflect principles of direct democracy and majority rule. Recent elections have shown that someone can become president without winning the popular vote, which goes against the principle of one person, one vote.

While smaller states may fear losing influence, a popular vote system may not diminish their voices as much as feared. Candidates would still need to build diverse coalitions and appeal to voters in all areas. A national campaign focused on issues important to the entire country could help bridge divisions in society.

In conclusion, I believe switching to a popular vote system for electing the president would uphold democratic principles and promote policies that represent all Americans. The Electoral College may not align with equality and broad representation in today's society. I urge you to consider supporting a move to determine the presidency based on the national popular vote.

One major issue with computer games is their addictive nature, as they can consume hours of a child's time without providing a sense of real accomplishment. This can lead to children becoming addicted to the game itself rather than the educational content.

Another concern is the violence often present in computer games, which can desensitize children to violent behavior and potentially lead to them acting out aggressively.

Additionally, the demanding nature of computer games can make them addictive, as they require intense focus and concentration to complete.

As a result, steps should be taken to limit children's exposure to computer games, although this can be challenging without negative consequences for the children involved.",1
201,"I am excited to write an essay about how failure can ultimately lead to success. Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts,"" which I find to be profound. Here are two reasons why failure can pave the way for success:

Firstly, failure teaches us important lessons. For example, I may not excel in math, but through repeated attempts and learning from my mistakes, I have discovered helpful strategies to improve. Failure serves as a valuable teacher, highlighting areas for growth and development.

Secondly, failure can help us build resilience. By experiencing setbacks and learning to overcome them, we become stronger and more determined. This resilience enables us to persevere through challenges and ultimately achieve success.

In conclusion, while failure may be difficult, it can ultimately lead to success if we remain persistent and open to learning from our failures.",1
202,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that schools providing distance learning as an alternative for students to attend classes from home via online or video conferencing has its pros and cons. While it may offer convenience for some students, it can also impact student motivation and communication with teachers negatively.

One benefit of distance learning is the convenience it provides to students. They can participate in classes from their own homes, which is especially helpful for those with busy schedules or who live far from school. This can also save time and money on commuting, which can be a burden for some families.

Another advantage is the flexibility in scheduling that distance learning allows. Students can choose when and where to attend classes, which is beneficial for those with other commitments like part-time jobs or extracurricular activities. This can help students manage their academic and personal lives better.

However, there are drawbacks to distance learning as well. One major disadvantage is the potential impact on student motivation. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may struggle to stay focused on their studies. Additionally, the lack of in-person interaction with teachers and peers can hinder student engagement and motivation.

Another downside is the challenge of communication with teachers. While technology has made it easier to communicate through email and messaging apps, it can still be hard to replicate the same level of support and interaction as in-person communication. This can make it tough for students to ask questions and receive timely help.

In conclusion, while distance learning has its benefits, it also has its drawbacks. While it may be convenient for some students, it can also affect student motivation and communication with teachers negatively. Schools should carefully weigh the pros and cons of offering distance learning and provide the necessary support and resources to ensure student success in this learning environment.",1

Stories abound of people who sought counsel and went on to achieve great things. For instance, in 2010, Ana Brisk sought advice from a photojournalist during a difficult period and ultimately won an Academy Award. On the other hand, not seeking advice can have serious consequences, especially in challenging situations. Taking risks without consulting those with more experience can lead to disastrous results. It is crucial to remember that others have likely faced similar challenges and can offer valuable insights that we may not have considered. Therefore, it is important to not hesitate to ask for guidance from those who have more life experience. Their advice can provide perspective and guidance in tough times, helping us to make better choices.",1

This behavior can lead to lower academic performance and increased time needed to complete assignments. Additionally, bringing cell phones into the classroom can disrupt the learning environment, as students may use them to record lectures, causing concerns about privacy among classmates and leading to feelings of discomfort and decreased morale. Moreover, cell phones can also be a source of cyberbullying, even if students do not actively use them to harass their peers.

207,"Title: Uncovering the Enigma of the Face on Mars

Introduction:
The Face on Mars, also known as the Cydonia Mensae, is a peculiar formation on the Martian surface that bears a striking resemblance to a human face. This enigmatic feature has captivated people worldwide, leading to a plethora of theories and conjecture about its origins.

Body:
Situated in the Cydonia region of Mars, the Cydonia Mensae was first identified by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971. It wasn't until 1976, when the Viking 1 orbiter captured a detailed image of the Face, that it garnered global attention.
Initially believed to be a naturally occurring formation sculpted by wind and weather, the Face has since sparked alternative explanations from scientists and researchers. Some suggest it could be evidence of an ancient Martian civilization or the handiwork of extraterrestrial beings.
One hypothesis proposes that the Face on Mars is the handiwork of an advanced Martian civilization, citing its intricate details, symmetry, and apparent age as evidence. Another theory posits that the Face was created by ancient aliens as a monument to their presence on Mars, popularized by the book ""Chariots of the Gods"" by Erich von Däniken.
A third theory suggests that the Face may be the result of natural phenomena like volcanic activity or meteorite impacts, which could create face-like structures through geological processes.
Despite the myriad of theories, the true origin of the Face on Mars remains elusive. The prevailing explanation remains the natural formation theory, attributing the Face to wind erosion and material deposition.
Conclusion:
The Face on Mars continues to intrigue scientists, researchers, and the public due to its uncanny resemblance to a human face. While various theories attempt to explain its existence, the true nature of the Cydonia Mensae remains shrouded in mystery. With ongoing Mars exploration missions, there is hope that more data will be collected to unravel the mystery surrounding this intriguing feature on our neighboring planet.",1
208,"The Negative Impact of Technology on Society

Technology has transformed the way we live and engage with the world, making our lives more convenient and efficient through online classes, shopping, and communication. However, I believe that technology has had adverse effects on society.

One major drawback of technology is the decrease in face-to-face interactions due to the prevalence of social media and online communication platforms. This has resulted in diminished depth and understanding in our relationships.

Another negative impact is the reduction in physical activity as a result of the ease of online shopping and remote work, leading to increased sedentary behavior and health issues like obesity.

Furthermore, technology has contributed to a decline in the appreciation and support of arts and culture, with fewer people attending theaters and museums in favor of online platforms. This has hindered cultural exchange and understanding between communities.

212,"It is often claimed that young people today do not dedicate sufficient time to assisting their communities. However, I disagree with this assertion. In reality, I believe that young individuals are more involved in their communities than ever before.

To begin with, young people are better educated now, leading to a heightened awareness of social issues. Consequently, many of them actively participate in community service, volunteering their time to aid those in need.

While there are advantages to graduating early, there are also disadvantages that need to be taken into account. This essay will examine the benefits and drawbacks of early high school graduation, as well as the lifestyle changes that early graduates may encounter.

One of the main advantages of graduating early is that it allows students to jumpstart their future. By finishing high school early, students can move on to college or the workforce sooner, opening up more opportunities and improving their career prospects. Additionally, early graduation can demonstrate a student's dedication and commitment to their education, which can impress colleges and employers.

However, there are also drawbacks to graduating early. One major drawback is the stress that comes with striving for perfection in all classes, leading to high levels of anxiety.

233,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for replacing the Electoral College with a system that elects the president of the United States based on the popular vote.

The Electoral College is outdated and does not accurately represent the will of the people. In recent elections, the popular vote winner has lost the presidency multiple times, indicating that the system is not functioning as intended.

There are several reasons why the Electoral College should be eliminated. Firstly, it gives disproportionate power to a few states, as seen in the 2016 election where the popular vote winner did not become president. This disparity in power can discourage voter turnout, especially in states considered safe for one candidate.

Additionally, the Electoral College is vulnerable to fraud and corruption, as seen in the controversial 2000 election in Florida. The system is also unfair, giving more voting power to voters in certain states over others.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College should be abolished in favor of a national popular vote for president. I urge you to support this change.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",1

235,"Starting a career at a young age has been a topic of discussion for many years. Some believe that young individuals are more ambitious and energetic, while others argue that they need more experience and education to succeed in their careers. In this essay, I will examine the advantages and disadvantages of starting a career at a young age and present evidence to support my viewpoint.

On one hand, beginning a career early has several benefits. Young people are often more ambitious and energetic, which can aid them in achieving success in their careers. They have more time to learn and develop, leading to potential long-term success. Additionally, young individuals tend to be more open-minded and adaptable, which can be advantageous in navigating a constantly changing job market.

For instance, many doctors and lawyers start their careers at a young age by attending medical or law school, completing their training, and then entering their profession. By starting early, they have more time to gain experience and establish their reputation, potentially leading to greater opportunities for advancement and higher salaries.

On the other hand, starting a career at a young age also has drawbacks. Young individuals may lack the same level of experience and expertise as more seasoned professionals, making it challenging for them to compete in certain industries or roles. Additionally, they may not have the same financial stability as older professionals, which can pose difficulties in supporting themselves and their families.

For example, teachers often begin their careers at a young age out of passion for education and a desire to make a difference. However, they may struggle to effectively manage a classroom and provide quality education due to their lack of experience compared to more seasoned educators.

In conclusion, starting a career at a young age has both advantages and disadvantages. While young individuals may possess ambition and energy, they may lack the experience and expertise of older professionals. Ultimately, the decision to start a career early should be based on individual circumstances and goals. It is crucial for young people to carefully weigh the pros and cons and make an informed decision that aligns with their future aspirations.",1
236,"As a student in the trade 6 program, I strongly believe that homework is a necessary component of the learning process. It serves to solidify the concepts taught in class, allowing us to practice and apply our knowledge.

By working on assignments, we learn how to effectively manage our time, concentrate on tasks, and take responsibility for our learning. These skills not only benefit us in completing homework but also in other schoolwork and future endeavors.

While some may argue that homework causes unnecessary stress, I believe that when assigned in appropriate amounts, it can be beneficial. Teachers typically assign a manageable workload that we can handle, which can actually reduce stress during class time by allowing us to practice and master the material beforehand.

In summary, homework is a valuable tool in our education as it reinforces classroom learning, fosters essential skills, and prepares us for future achievements. When given in moderation, homework can be a positive asset for learning and personal growth.",1
237,"There is no definitive answer as to whether relocating large companies, factories, and their employees to rural areas would effectively address traffic and housing issues in urban centers.

276,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my strong support for replacing the Electoral College with a popular vote system for electing the president. I believe this change is necessary to ensure that every citizen's vote holds equal weight and that the president is elected by the majority of Americans.

The Electoral College, established in the 18th century, is no longer relevant to our modern governance. It unfairly gives more power to certain states and can result in a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the election, as seen in the 2016 election. This system, which is winner-take-all in most states, allows a candidate to win all of a state's electoral votes with even a single vote margin, giving disproportionate influence to less populous states.

I believe the Electoral College is undemocratic and outdated, and I urge you to support its abolition. The president should be elected by the majority of the American people, with every vote counting equally.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Your Name",1
277,"The concept of a four-day school week has become increasingly popular in recent years, sparking a debate about its advantages and disadvantages. Some believe it could benefit students by reducing stress levels, while others argue it may have negative consequences. This essay will explore the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing the four-day school week.

One advantage of the four-day school week is that it could alleviate stress on students, who often face pressure to excel academically. With an extra day off each week, students would have more time to relax and recharge, potentially improving their mental health and overall well-being.

Additionally, the four-day school week could provide students with more time for extracurricular activities and hobbies, fostering well-rounded individuals with diverse skills and experiences. It could also strengthen relationships with family and friends, enhancing social skills.

However, there are concerns about the four-day school week, such as a potential lack of time for completing schoolwork and participating in extracurricular activities. This could lead to a decline in academic performance and fewer students engaging in extracurriculars.

Furthermore, the reduced school week may hinder students' future success by limiting their time to develop necessary skills and knowledge. This could result in fewer students pursuing higher education or advanced degrees.

In conclusion, the four-day school week presents both advantages and disadvantages. While it may reduce stress and provide more time for activities, it could also lead to challenges in academic performance and future success.",1
278,"Before delving into the exploration of Venus, it is important to understand the unique characteristics of the planet itself. Venus is the second largest planet in our solar system and orbits closest to the Sun after Mercury. Despite being similar in size to Earth, Venus has a much denser atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and other gases. This thick atmosphere creates a greenhouse effect, resulting in extreme temperatures and sulfuric acid clouds that obscure sunlight from reaching the surface.

Exploring Venus has been a challenging task for scientists due to the harsh conditions on the planet. Previous missions have faced obstacles such as high temperatures and technical malfunctions, but some have been successful in gathering valuable data. The Magellan Spacecraft, for example, mapped a significant portion of Venus' surface and discovered evidence of volcanic and tectonic activity. The Venus Express mission also provided insights into the planet's atmosphere and magnetosphere before concluding in 2014.

Despite the lack of recent exploration missions, there are ongoing efforts to develop new spacecraft for further study of Venus. Proposed missions like DAVINCI+ and Veritas aim to gather more detailed information about the planet's atmosphere and surface features, which could lead to a better understanding of Venus' geological history and potential habitability.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to share my views on whether to keep the Electoral College or switch to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States. After reviewing the arguments presented in the provided passages, I believe that retaining the Electoral College is the best option. Despite concerns about its democratic nature, the Electoral College offers practical advantages that outweigh these concerns.

One key benefit of the Electoral College is the certainty it provides in election outcomes. Disputes over Electoral College results are less common than disputes over popular vote results, as explained in passage 18. The winner of the Electoral College typically wins by a larger margin than the popular vote, thanks to the winner-take-all system in most states. This clear mandate for the elected president helps prevent prolonged disputes over election results.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it ensures the president has broad appeal across regions, as discussed in passage 19. By requiring support from multiple regions, the Electoral College promotes national unity and prevents candidates with only regional appeal from winning. This ensures that the president represents the entire country's interests and prevents certain regions from feeling left out of the election process.

The focus on swing states is another benefit of the Electoral College, as mentioned in passage 20. Candidates concentrate their efforts on these states, leading to increased attention and engagement from voters. This system encourages voters to make informed decisions and ultimately results in a more engaged electorate.

Additionally, the Electoral College gives appropriate weight to large states, as explained in passage 21. This balances the influence of smaller states and ensures that candidates pay attention to states of all sizes during the campaign. This system prevents smaller states from having disproportionate influence in a popular vote system.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for runoff elections, as stated in passage 22. This saves time and resources by guaranteeing a clear winner without the need for additional rounds of voting.

While the Electoral College may discourage voters in states that are likely to vote a certain way, as mentioned in passage 23, voter turnout in presidential elections remains high. People are motivated to vote to express their political preferences, regardless of their individual impact on the national election outcome.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College is not perfect, it offers practical benefits for selecting the President of the United States. It ensures certainty in election outcomes, promotes national unity, increases voter engagement, gives proportional weight to large states, and avoids the need for runoff elections. I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College based on these advantages.

Thank you for considering my views on this matter. I believe that maintaining the Electoral College will continue to ensure a fair and effective election process for the presidency.

Sincerely,

284,"An Essay on a Cowboy Who Surfed the Waves

When thinking of a cowboy, many envision a rugged figure from the Old West, often seen on horseback herding cattle or engaging in various activities related to their profession. However, as perspectives on life evolve, so do ideas about what defines a cowboy. While traditionally associated with the Western frontier, it is important to recognize the qualities of resilience, adaptability, and courage that a true cowboy embodies. These traits were exemplified by a remarkable individual who transitioned from horseback riding to surfing giant waves.

Robert August, known as the first surfing cowboy, was not only a great surf explorer but also a visionary artist who defied odds. Born in 1929 during the Great Depression, Robert's journey to surfing was unique. Growing up in Santa Monica, California, he discovered his passion for surfing at a young age, despite his father initially restricting his surfing to the winter season.

As Robert's surfing skills grew, his career took a turn when he met filmmaker Bruce Brown in 1952. Brown needed a skilled surfboard rider for a documentary on big-wave surfing, and Robert's bravery and talent led him to participate. This marked the beginning of Robert's successful career in surfing, where he became a prominent figure in the surfing community during the Golden Era of Surfing in the 1950s and 60s.

Robert's contribution to surfing, through documentaries like 'Surf Crazy', revolutionized the perception of big-wave surfing. His legacy as a cowboy surfer who embraced new possibilities and pushed boundaries continues to inspire surfers today. Robert August's ability to blend the essence of a cowboy with the vast ocean waves solidified his place as an iconic figure in the world of surfing, embodying the spirit of resilience, adaptability, and courage that defines a true cowboy.",1

295,"Dear Principal Johnson,

I am writing to discuss the school's cell phone policy currently under review. I believe that Policy 1, which allows students to bring phones but requires them to be turned off during class time, is the best choice for our school. This policy strikes a good balance between recognizing students' need to communicate outside of school and maintaining focus on learning during academic periods. 

Policy 1 acknowledges that students live in a technology-driven world and often use their phones to stay connected with friends and family. A complete ban under Policy 2 may be seen as too strict by many students. Policy 1 still emphasizes learning by having phones off during class, while allowing responsible phone use during free times.

Furthermore, Policy 1 encourages students to make responsible decisions. By treating students as mature individuals capable of following the turned off requirement, most will rise to meet that expectation. A complete ban may hinder our goal of fostering independent, self-disciplined learners. Policy 1 establishes clear rules while also granting students some freedom, teaching them how to behave appropriately in different situations.

For these reasons, I believe that Policy 1 is the best approach for our school. It allows for technology use in a controlled manner that prioritizes academics and promotes personal responsibility through structured freedom. I hope you will consider implementing this policy. Please let me know if you need any further clarification or information.

Thank you for your consideration.

314,"The debate surrounding the ""Face on Mars"" has been ongoing for years, with some attributing its creation to aliens and others arguing that it is a natural geological formation. After reading the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars,' I am convinced that the face is indeed a natural landform. In my essay, I will argue that the Face on Mars is simply a mesa, similar to those found on Earth, and provide evidence to support this claim.

The Face on Mars is situated in Cydonia, an area of Mars that has piqued scientific interest due to its potential history as a site of an ancient Martian ocean. This suggests that the area's geology may have been influenced by water, a natural process. Therefore, it is likely that the Face is not the result of alien intervention but rather natural geological processes.

Furthermore, images captured by NASA's Mars Global Surveyor in 1997 revealed that the Face is a mesa, akin to Earth's buttes. The presence of mesas supports the argument that the Face is a natural formation rather than alien-made. Mesas are formed through the erosion of softer rock layers, exposing harder, erosion-resistant rock layers. This process can create features resembling faces, explaining the human-like appearance of the Face on Mars.

The article also discusses laser altimetry, which confirmed the Face's status as a natural mesa. The data showed that the Face is not perfectly symmetrical, a characteristic that aligns with natural formations rather than artificial ones. Additionally, the presence of multiple similar mesas in Cydonia suggests that the Face is not unique and is simply another example of natural geological processes at work.

In conclusion, the evidence presented in 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' supports the notion that the Face is a natural formation. Its location in an area possibly influenced by an ancient Martian ocean, its mesa-like structure, and the lack of perfect symmetry all point towards a natural origin. The Face on Mars is not the product of aliens but rather a fascinating example of the geological forces shaping our universe.",1

Body:
To begin with, let's examine the origins of the Face on Mars. Initially captured in a photo taken by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft 25 years ago, it was initially thought to be an unusual rock formation. However, further investigation revealed that it is actually a natural landform, similar to Earth's buttes or mesas. This conclusion is reinforced by images captured by the Mars Global Surveyor in 1997, which clearly show the Face as a natural feature.

Additionally, laser altimetry was utilized to confirm the natural origins of the Face. This technology measures the distance between the planet's surface and the satellite, enabling scientists to create detailed topographical maps. Data collected from laser altimetry indicated that the Face shares similarities in shape and size with other mesas in the Cydonian region, suggesting it is not a unique structure created by aliens but rather a common geological feature on Mars.

Another crucial aspect to consider is the location of the Face on Mars. Situated at a potential ancient Martian ocean boundary, this raises questions about Mars' history and the possibility that the Face was shaped by natural processes such as water. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of other surrounding geological features believed to be natural as well.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the notion that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. While the idea of alien involvement may be enticing, it is imperative to rely on scientific evidence when drawing conclusions. The Face on Mars serves as a captivating geological feature and a prime example of the natural wonders present on other planets. I hope that the information presented has persuaded you that the Face on Mars is not a product of alien creation but rather an inherent part of the Martian landscape.",1

335,"Advantages of Restricting Car Usage

Cars have become a crucial aspect of suburban living, but recent studies suggest that imposing limits on car usage can offer significant benefits. Articles by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robert Duffer, and Andrew Silky highlight the advantages of reducing reliance on cars in various cities globally. These benefits include a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, better air quality, reduced traffic congestion, and the encouragement of alternative transportation methods.

One key advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Rosenthal notes that passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain parts of the United States. By cutting down on the number of cars on the road, these emissions can be significantly lowered, leading to a healthier environment. For instance, Paris implemented a partial driving ban during a smog episode, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and improved air quality (Duffer).

Another benefit is the alleviation of traffic congestion. When car usage is restricted, roads become less congested, making commuting quicker and more efficient. In Vauban, a German suburb where cars are mostly prohibited, streets are peaceful, allowing for smoother and quieter transportation (Rosenthal). Similarly, during a car-free day in Bogotá, millions of people opted to walk, bike, skate, or take buses to work, resulting in traffic-free streets (Silky). By limiting car usage, cities can ease traffic congestion and enhance overall transportation quality.

Moreover, restricting car usage also encourages the use of alternative transportation modes. When cars are less relied upon, individuals are more likely to utilize public transportation, walk, bike, or carpool. Vauban, for example, has improved access to public transportation and placed stores within walking distance, promoting a healthier and more active lifestyle (Rosenthal). Bogotá's car-free day has also inspired people to explore alternative transportation methods, such as biking and taking buses, fostering a more sustainable and efficient transportation system (Silky).

340,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for the elimination of the Electoral College. I believe that this system is outdated and undemocratic, no longer serving the best interests of the American people.

The Electoral College was established in the 18th century when the United States was a very different nation. Due to slow communication and transportation, a popular vote for president was not feasible. The Electoral College was created as a compromise between those who wanted Congress to elect the president and those who wanted the people to elect the president.

However, in the 21st century, the Electoral College is no longer necessary. Advances in communication and transportation have made it easier for people to participate in the political process. Additionally, recent elections have shown that the Electoral College can be undemocratic, with the popular vote winner losing the election.

The Electoral College gives disproportionate power to small states, as they have more electoral votes per capita than larger states. This means that a person's vote in a small state is worth more than a person's vote in a large state. Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on a few key battleground states, neglecting the needs of the majority of the population.

I believe that the Electoral College is an unfair system that should be abolished in favor of electing the president by popular vote.

341,"First impressions play a crucial role in human interaction, as they are the initial judgments people make about each other based on limited information. These perceptions can greatly influence the way individuals interact and can have long-lasting effects. In this essay, I will examine the importance of first impressions and their consequences, drawing from personal experiences and examples to support my argument.

Initial perceptions are often formed based on physical appearance, body language, and tone of voice. People tend to quickly assess others using these factors, even with minimal information. For instance, when I first met my best friend, her warm smile, friendly demeanor, and positive energy immediately made me feel at ease and led to a strong and enduring friendship.

However, negative first impressions can also occur, impacting future interactions. For example, my initial impression of my math teacher as stern and unapproachable hindered my ability to connect with him, despite my efforts to do so. This negative perception limited my opportunities to learn from him and made it challenging to see him in a positive light.

Furthermore, first impressions can affect individuals' self-perception. When starting a new job, I was anxious about how my coworkers would perceive me and made a conscious effort to present myself positively. This proactive approach helped me gain confidence, leading to success in my role and the courage to pursue new opportunities.

In summary, first impressions are a powerful force that can shape relationships and self-perception. It is essential to be mindful of the impact of these initial judgments and strive to make positive impressions to foster meaningful connections and personal growth.",1

This environment fosters personal and professional development, empowering students to become leaders in their respective fields and make meaningful contributions to society.",1
381,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for eliminating the Electoral College and instead electing the President of the United States based on the popular vote.

The Electoral College, established by the U.S. Constitution, is a group of electors chosen by each state to elect the President and Vice President every four years. The number of electors each state has is based on its representation in Congress.

The Electoral College has been a controversial issue for many years, with the most recent controversy arising in 2016 when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost the election to Donald Trump. This undemocratic system has led to unfair advantages for small states and encourages candidates to focus on battleground states, neglecting other parts of the country.

I believe the Electoral College should be abolished because it is undemocratic, gives unfair advantages to small states, and encourages candidates to focus on specific states. I urge you to support legislation that would elect the President by popular vote.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

382,"As a concerned high school student, I believe that the advancement of driverless cars should be stopped due to safety concerns, privacy issues, and the negative impact on employment. While the idea of not having to drive may seem convenient, the risks of relying on technology for our safety are too significant. The article ""Driverless Cars are Coming"" highlights the benefits of this technology, such as fewer accidents and improved traffic flow, but fails to address the potential drawbacks. These include the possibility of technical failures or hacking, invasion of privacy through data collection, and the displacement of millions of jobs in the transportation industry. It is crucial to pause the development of driverless cars until their safety and security can be guaranteed for passengers and society as a whole.",1
383,"The initial impact we make on others is crucial in various aspects of life, such as job interviews and romantic encounters, as it can have lasting effects. I recall feeling anxious during my first job interview, knowing that the interviewer's first impression of me could determine my success. Despite my nerves, I managed to make a positive impression and ultimately secure the position. This experience taught me the importance of creating a strong initial connection to achieve desired outcomes.

This principle extends to different areas, including relationships and professional success. I have noticed that individuals who present themselves well to their superiors tend to receive better treatment at work. Those who make an effort to build positive relationships with their peers often excel in their roles.

While first impressions are not the sole factor in determining outcomes, they can significantly impact opportunities and long-term benefits. Although the pressure to make a good first impression can be overwhelming, the rewards are usually worth the effort in the end.",1
384,"I do not agree with the principal's decision to mandate all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurricular activities have their benefits, forcing students to take part will not fully realize those benefits and disregards their individual choices.

Not all students have the time or interest to add more commitments to their already busy academic schedules. Some students may need to prioritize their studies to maintain good grades, which should be their main focus in school. Others may have family obligations or jobs that limit their availability after school. Making extracurricular participation mandatory could have negative effects on these students' academic performance and well-being. It is unfair to penalize students who are unable to participate due to legitimate time constraints beyond their control.

Furthermore, successful extracurricular programs rely on enthusiastic and willing participants. Forcing reluctant students to join an activity will not lead to meaningful involvement or positive contributions. These students may feel resentful towards the obligations and may disrupt those who are genuinely interested. When participation is not driven by genuine interest, the quality of extracurricular programs is likely to suffer.

Instead of enforcing mandatory participation, a better approach would be to encourage student involvement and offer a variety of options to cater to different interests, schedules, and levels of commitment. Students should be able to choose activities that align with their circumstances and motivations. This approach respects student autonomy while still promoting engagement. The principal's goal of having engaged students is better achieved through inspiring voluntary participation, rather than through compulsory assignments. Ultimately, respecting student choices and nurturing natural enthusiasm will lead to better outcomes than a mandatory quota system.",1

392,"Dear Principal Smith,

I am writing to respectfully share my thoughts on the proposed policy change that would mandate students to maintain a B average in order to participate in sports and extracurricular activities. While I understand the importance of good grades, I believe that such a strict requirement could have a negative impact on student involvement and achievement.

Requiring students to have B's or higher may discourage those who are working hard to improve their grades from participating. Many students find that sports and clubs serve as motivation to focus on their schoolwork, and the extra time commitments leave less room for distractions. Removing this opportunity could result in decreased academic effort from students who are on the verge of achieving a B average. For students facing personal challenges or difficult courses, the social and mental breaks provided by activities can help them persevere when studies become overwhelming.

A C average still shows that students are passing their classes and making progress. Some students may struggle more in certain subjects but put in a lot of effort. They deserve recognition and support through continued inclusion. Strict cutoff policies often do not take into account the full circumstances of students and can feel unfair to those who are giving their best effort.

Instead of decreasing participation, having more moderate requirements allows a greater number of students to get involved and benefit from the educational advantages of extracurricular activities. These benefits include learning time management, developing teamwork skills, feeling a sense of belonging in the school community, and exploring interests that may inspire further study. Especially as we navigate through these challenging times, programs that foster school spirit and connection should be accessible to all students.

For these reasons, I believe that the proposed B average policy may be too rigid and could unnecessarily reduce student involvement and motivation. A C average demonstrates passing grades and effort that deserve support through continued opportunities for enrichment. Maintaining a more moderate standard encourages broader participation, which research shows enhances learning. I appreciate your consideration of these perspectives as decisions are made regarding policy changes.

393,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for eliminating the Electoral College and instead electing the president through a popular vote. I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that no longer represents the interests of the American people.

The Electoral College was established in 1787 as a compromise between those who wanted Congress to elect the president and those who wanted a popular vote. The Founding Fathers believed it would ensure the president was elected by a majority of states rather than the people.

However, the Electoral College has become increasingly undemocratic. In recent elections, the popular vote winner has lost the presidency four times, including in 2016 when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost to Donald Trump.

The Electoral College also gives disproportionate power to small states, with each state having at least three electors regardless of population. This means a voter in Wyoming has more influence than a voter in California.

I believe the Electoral College no longer serves the interests of small states and instead encourages candidates to focus on swing states, neglecting the rest of the country.

I advocate for electing the president by popular vote to ensure the majority of people have a say in the election and to give all voters equal representation.

I urge you to support a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College and elect the president by popular vote. Thank you for your time and consideration.

395,"As we face the challenges of climate change, it is evident that decreasing our dependence on cars is essential for the well-being of our planet and its inhabitants. The recent driving restrictions in Paris, France, which prohibited cars with even-numbered plates on certain days, demonstrate the advantages of reducing car usage.

Primarily, cutting back on car use significantly decreases air pollution, particularly in cities like Paris, Beijing, and London where diesel vehicles are prevalent. By limiting the number of cars on the road, the Parisian government was able to reduce congestion by 60% and improve air quality, leading to a noticeable decrease in particulate matter levels.

Additionally, reducing car use promotes the use of alternative modes of transportation such as public transport, cycling, and walking. During the driving ban in Paris, public transport was made free, encouraging people to switch from cars to buses, trains, and subways. This not only reduces air pollution but also eases traffic congestion and promotes healthier lifestyles.

Furthermore, reducing car use helps combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major source of these emissions, contributing to global warming. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and help mitigate the effects of climate change.

Lastly, reducing car use can have positive economic impacts by reducing reliance on finite fossil fuels and saving money on fuel costs. Investing in public transport and alternative transportation modes can also create jobs and stimulate local economies.

In conclusion, the advantages of reducing car use are evident. By limiting the number of cars on the road, we can reduce air pollution, promote alternative transportation, combat climate change, and have positive economic effects. It is crucial that we take action to reduce our reliance on cars and move towards a more sustainable future as we confront the challenges of climate change.",1

People may follow your every step because they want to succeed in life by being influenced by you. It is crucial to show people that they can achieve what they think they are not capable of.

For example, my friend John's daughter Sarah wants to become a doctor, even though she is currently studying biology in college. John and his wife Sarah, who is a doctor herself, want to influence their daughter to pursue a medical career. However, Sarah is being influenced by her English teacher, who believes she has the potential to become an English teacher. Sarah's teacher sees her hard work and behavior and believes in her abilities.

Similarly, when my brother was nine years old, he wanted to be a musician but was afraid of performing in front of others. When he graduated from high school, he wanted to attend music school, but my mom realized that he actually wanted to pursue a career in music. She encouraged him by telling him that others may doubt his abilities, but they do not truly know what he is capable of. With her influence, he is now a successful musician working for a record label. My mom's example and belief in him were more influential than anyone else's opinions.

I am writing to express my endorsement of the Electoral College in the U.S. presidential elections. Despite criticism of its undemocratic nature, I believe it is a vital component of our representative democracy.

The Electoral College guarantees a clear and definitive election outcome by awarding all of a state's electoral votes to the candidate with the most votes in that state. This certainty is crucial for promoting unity and stability in a diverse country like ours.

Additionally, the Electoral College necessitates candidates to appeal to a broad range of regions, ensuring that the President represents the entire nation, not just the most populous areas. This is essential for a country as vast and varied as the United States.

By focusing attention on swing states, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in areas where their efforts can make a difference, rather than just the most populous states. This ensures a more competitive and representative election process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of large and small states, ensuring that all states have a voice in the election. Without it, candidates may only focus on populous states, neglecting the interests of smaller ones.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming run-off elections, providing a clear and decisive outcome. 

In conclusion, I urge you to support the Electoral College in U.S. presidential elections as it is a necessary element of our democracy that ensures representation for all regions of the country. Thank you for your time and consideration.

400,"I support stricter gun control laws because I believe they will help decrease gun violence and enhance community safety. There are multiple reasons for my stance, which I will elaborate on below.

To begin with, stricter gun control laws can lower the occurrence of accidental shootings. If obtaining firearms is more challenging, there will be fewer guns in households and on the streets, reducing the risk of children or inexperienced individuals accidentally discharging a weapon and causing harm. For instance, in 2019, a three-year-old in Florida accidentally shot himself with his father's easily accessible handgun, a tragedy that could have been prevented with stricter gun control laws.

Additionally, stricter gun control laws can help prevent mass shootings. Countries like Japan and Australia, where guns are hard to obtain, have very few mass shootings compared to the United States, where gun ownership is widespread. In 2018 alone, there were 340 mass shootings in the US, highlighting the urgent need for stricter gun control laws to address this issue.

Lastly, stricter gun control laws can reduce the number of suicides. Research indicates that having a gun at home increases the risk of suicide. By making firearms harder to obtain, there will be fewer guns available, decreasing the likelihood of suicide. For example, in the US, where gun ownership is high, the gun suicide rate is significantly higher than in other affluent countries.

In summary, I believe that implementing stricter gun control laws is crucial to curbing gun violence and enhancing community safety. By reducing accidental shootings, preventing mass shootings, and lowering the number of suicides, we can create a safer environment for all.",1

I am writing to share my concerns about the new policy that requires students to maintain a B average in order to participate in extracurricular activities. While I understand the importance of good grades, I believe that linking participation to a specific letter grade may not be the best solution. There are several reasons why I disagree with this rule.

Firstly, prohibiting students with a C average from participating could negatively impact their motivation and academic performance. For many students, being part of a team or club is a driving force that encourages them to excel in their classes. Removing this incentive could lead to a decline in grades rather than an improvement.

Furthermore, extracurricular activities provide valuable life lessons such as time management, leadership, responsibility, and teamwork, which are not reflected in academic transcripts but are crucial for students' development. Not all students learn at the same pace or in the same way, and for some, these activities are what keep them engaged in school. Excluding students with a C average from participating would deprive them of these benefits.

Another concern is that students from lower-income families may face challenges that affect their academic performance, such as having to work after school. This rule may disproportionately impact these students and does not take into account the various obstacles they may encounter.

In conclusion, while promoting good grades is important, tying participation to a specific grade level may have negative consequences for student motivation, learning, and growth. A more equitable approach that considers each student's individual circumstances would be more appropriate. I strongly urge you to reconsider this policy change. The benefits of extracurricular involvement are too valuable to be denied to students who work hard despite facing academic challenges.

I am writing to urge a shift from the current Electoral College system to electing the president through a popular vote in the United States. While the Electoral College was initially intended to give smaller states more influence, I believe that a popular vote system would be more democratic and in line with our nation's values.

One common argument for keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to appeal to a wide range of states. However, recent elections have shown candidates focusing primarily on swing states, leaving many states feeling neglected. A popular vote system would require candidates to appeal to a broader demographic across the entire country, rather than just swing states.

Some argue that without the Electoral College, candidates may only campaign in urban areas with larger populations. However, candidates already heavily rely on mass media to reach voters, ensuring rural voters can still have their voices heard. Additionally, every vote should hold equal weight, regardless of the state it is cast in. A popular vote would ensure that every vote nationwide directly impacts the outcome.

While the Electoral College has its structural benefits, it has led to instances where presidents were elected despite losing the popular vote. This has caused many to question the fairness and legitimacy of the democratic process. A popular vote system would elect presidents based solely on the candidate supported by the majority of American people, creating a more representative system with fewer doubts about fairness.

As we approach another election cycle, the debate over the Electoral College as a method for selecting the President of the United States continues among citizens and political leaders. While the Electoral College has its drawbacks, I believe that switching to a popular vote system would present even more challenges.

One issue with the Electoral College is the winner-takes-all system in each state, which can result in candidates neglecting states where they are unlikely to win. This can lead to certain regions being underrepresented and limit the diversity of ideas presented to voters. Eliminating the winner-takes-all system would encourage candidates to campaign in states with closer margins, ensuring all voters have a voice.

Additionally, the possibility of a tie in the Electoral College vote could lead to the House of Representatives selecting the President, potentially resulting in a candidate with less national support being chosen. While this may seem fair, it could allow a candidate to win by targeting states with smaller populations rather than the country as a whole.

Despite its flaws, the Electoral College ensures that candidates cannot win the presidency solely by appealing to urban or coastal areas. This guarantees that the President is chosen by representatives from all regions, providing a more balanced perspective on the nation's needs.

Abolishing the Electoral College in favor of a popular vote system could increase polarization and divisiveness in the US, as candidates may focus on winning over large urban areas rather than representing the entire nation.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College is not perfect, I believe it plays a vital role in ensuring candidates are elected by representatives from all regions of the country. I urge you to maintain the Electoral College as the current method for selecting the President of the United States.

412,"Title: The Benefits of Restricting Car Use

Introduction:
In recent years, there has been a growing movement to restrict car usage in different parts of the world. This change is motivated by concerns about greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, and the desire to build more sustainable and enjoyable communities. This essay will discuss the advantages of limiting car use by examining examples from Germany, France, and Colombia.

Main Body:

One of the key benefits of limiting car use is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" passenger cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. In the United States, transportation is the second-largest source of emissions, just behind power plants. By decreasing car use, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and help combat climate change.

Another advantage is the improvement of air quality. In Robert Duffer's article ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" it is mentioned that diesel fuel, commonly used in France, contributes to air pollution. Paris implemented a partial driving ban to address this issue, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and showcasing the positive impact of limiting car use on air quality.

Moreover, restricting car use can lead to the development of more sustainable and accessible communities. Andrew Silky's article ""Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá"" discusses how a car-free day in Bogotá, Colombia, aimed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. This event has inspired millions of Colombians to use alternative modes of transport, such as hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses to work. By prioritizing public transportation and non-motorized modes of transport, cities can become more livable, with reduced traffic congestion and improved accessibility for all residents.

Additionally, limiting car use can have economic benefits. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's article ""The End of Car Culture,"" it is mentioned that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less, leading to reduced carbon emissions. While this may negatively impact the car industry, it opens up opportunities for new transportation modes, like shared van services or bike sharing programs, to thrive. These alternatives can create jobs and offer affordable transportation options.

Conclusion:

Restricting car use offers numerous advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, creating sustainable communities, and stimulating economic growth. These benefits highlight the importance of transitioning away from car-dependent lifestyles for a more sustainable and enjoyable future. By implementing smart planning strategies and promoting alternative transportation modes, we can create a world where car use is limited, and our environment and communities thrive.",1

417,"Marijuana, also known as weed or cannabis, has sparked controversy in recent years. While some advocate for its legalization, others vehemently oppose it. In this essay, I will argue against the legalization of marijuana.

To begin with, marijuana is a detrimental substance that can have adverse impacts on an individual's well-being. It has been linked to respiratory issues, lung cancer, and cognitive impairment. Legalizing marijuana would facilitate its availability and usage, potentially exacerbating health concerns.

Furthermore, marijuana has addictive properties, leading individuals down a path of dependency and potentially exposing them to more dangerous substances. Legalization could convey a misguided message to youth, normalizing drug use and increasing the likelihood of substance abuse.

Lastly, legalizing marijuana may contribute to a rise in criminal activity. Users could be more inclined to engage in unlawful behavior, and the accessibility of the drug could fuel drug-related incidents, endangering innocent individuals.

In conclusion, I firmly oppose the legalization of marijuana. Its harmful effects on health, addictive nature, and potential for increased crime rates underscore the need for prevention and education efforts. Rather than making drugs more accessible, we should focus on raising awareness about the risks of substance abuse and implementing strategies to deter drug use.",1
418,"Gun control is a significant issue that impacts many individuals. I believe that implementing stricter gun control laws is crucial for enhancing safety. One reason for this is that mishandling guns can lead to accidents resulting in injuries or fatalities.

Subject: Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and emphasize its significance in the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College, rather than switching to a popular vote system, is crucial for preserving the principles envisioned by our Founding Fathers when designing our electoral system.

The Electoral College was established as a compromise between the election of the President by Congress and a popular vote. It consists of 538 electors, with a minimum of 270 electoral votes required for a candidate to win the presidency. This system ensures a balance of power between states and prevents larger states from dominating the election process.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is its certainty of outcome. Disputes over the result are less likely compared to a popular vote system, as the winner-take-all method used by most states creates a clear electoral vote victory even with a slight plurality in a state. This reduces the likelihood of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country has a voice in the election of the President, preventing candidates with only regional appeal from focusing solely on specific areas. This guarantees that the elected President represents the interests of the entire nation and not just a select few.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus on swing states, leading to a more engaged and informed electorate in those areas. It provides more weight to large states that may have been overshadowed by the apportionment of the Senate, ensuring that presidential candidates pay attention to the concerns of citizens in these states.

Furthermore, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, simplifying the election process and reducing complexity.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a vital part of our democracy that upholds the principles of our Founding Fathers and protects the interests of both large and small states. I urge you to support the Electoral College and oppose any efforts to replace it with a popular vote system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust in your judgment and dedication to serving the best interests of the people you represent. I look forward to your continued support for the important principles that strengthen our democratic system.

Sincerely,

420,"Dear Principal [Last Name],

I am writing to address the current school menu and the need for a transition to a healthier one. As an eighth grade student, I have observed that the current menu is not conducive to good health, which is a concern shared by many students, including myself. In this essay, I will discuss the unhealthy nature of the current menu and propose ways in which it can be improved.

The current school menu consists of processed and high-fat foods, such as pizza, fries, and burgers. These foods are not only calorie-dense but also lack essential nutrients necessary for a healthy diet. They are high in saturated fats and sodium, which can lead to long-term health issues like heart disease. Additionally, these foods promote a sedentary lifestyle, which is detrimental to students' physical and mental well-being.

Moreover, the lack of variety in healthy options on the menu is concerning. Students who wish to eat healthily have limited choices that are often unappealing. This lack of variety may lead to students making poor food choices or skipping meals altogether, which is not conducive to good health. Furthermore, the menu does not accommodate students with dietary restrictions, such as vegetarians or those with allergies, which can be frustrating and potentially dangerous.

To address these issues, I recommend that the school transition to a healthier menu. This could involve incorporating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins into the menu. For example, offering salads, sandwiches with whole grain bread, and baked options instead of fried foods. Additionally, providing more vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and dairy-free options can cater to students with dietary restrictions.

Furthermore, introducing healthier snacks like fresh fruit, nuts, and yogurt can promote better eating habits. Educating students on the importance of a healthy diet and providing resources to help them make informed food choices, such as nutrition classes, can also be beneficial.

Thank you for considering these suggestions for improving the school menu.

422,"Dear State Senator,

I am a 9th grade student writing to share my thoughts on the Electoral College system and its role in presidential elections. The system has been a topic of debate for centuries, with recent criticism focusing on its perceived outdated and undemocratic nature.

One major concern with the Electoral College is the potential for discrepancies between the national popular vote and the electoral vote, as seen in the 2000 election. This raises questions about the fairness and representation of the system.

Another issue is the disenfranchisement of voters in certain states, where those in the minority party may feel their votes do not matter. This can lead to lower voter turnout and a lack of representation for some groups.

Despite these criticisms, there are arguments in favor of the Electoral College. It provides certainty of outcome, requires candidates to appeal to a broad audience, focuses attention on swing states, and balances the influence of large states.

In conclusion, while there are valid arguments against the Electoral College, I believe it is still necessary and beneficial for our country. I urge you to consider these benefits and support the retention of the Electoral College in presidential elections.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

426,"The article ""Driverless Cars are Coming: Navigating the Road to the Future"" discusses important issues regarding safety, reliance on technology, and socio-economic impacts. I will argue that the advantages of driverless cars are greater than the drawbacks, but we must be careful to ensure a smooth and fair transition.

One key benefit of driverless cars is their potential to significantly reduce accidents on the road, as human error is responsible for the majority of crashes. By removing human drivers from the equation, driverless cars can eliminate accidents caused by distractions, alcohol, and speeding. Advanced sensors and algorithms also allow driverless cars to detect and respond to hazards more effectively than human drivers, with the ability to spot pedestrians from a much greater distance.

Additionally, driverless cars can improve mobility and accessibility for elderly and disabled individuals, revolutionizing transportation. By being able to summon a car with a smartphone, those who cannot drive themselves can regain independence and participate in activities previously out of reach.

However, concerns about safety and reliance on technology exist, as machines may not be able to make nuanced decisions like humans. There is also worry about the cost and exclusivity of driverless cars, potentially creating socio-economic disparities. Legal and ethical challenges, such as liability in accidents and algorithm biases, must also be addressed.

Despite these concerns, I believe that the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the risks. By proceeding cautiously and addressing the issues raised in the article, we can ensure a safe and fair transition to a driverless future. It is important for society to navigate this technological shift carefully and collaboratively to ensure that driverless cars enhance our lives without compromising safety or autonomy.",1
427,"Dear Ms. Principal,

I am writing to share my thoughts on the potential policy change regarding requiring students to maintain a B average in order to participate in sports or other activities. I believe it would be unjust to impose such a requirement.

Not all students excel academically, and some may struggle to achieve a B average despite their best efforts. It is important to provide all students with the opportunity to explore their interests and passions, regardless of their grades.

Participating in sports and activities can actually help students improve their academic performance by teaching them valuable skills such as discipline, teamwork, and time management. By denying students the chance to participate, we could be depriving them of the opportunity to develop these skills and enhance their grades.

Furthermore, mandating a B average could discourage students from participating in extracurricular activities altogether. Many students may feel discouraged and believe they are incapable of achieving a B average, leading to a decrease in participation rates and a lack of interest in extracurricular activities.

While I understand the concern about students not taking their studies seriously, I believe there are alternative ways to address this issue. Providing additional support and tutoring for struggling students or implementing a system where students can earn extra credit for participating in activities could be more effective solutions.

In conclusion, I oppose the idea of requiring a B average for participation in sports and activities as it could have negative consequences. Instead, I suggest focusing on supporting and encouraging all students to reach their full potential both inside and outside the classroom.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter.

429,"Having a clear policy regarding cell phones and other gadgets is crucial for schools. While Policy 1 and Policy 2 differ in their approach, Policy 1 is the preferred option to prevent students from breaking school rules. Policy 1 is more stringent in regulating phone use during school hours, requiring students to refrain from using their phones in class unless permitted by the teacher. This helps students understand the school's expectations regarding phone use. On the other hand, Policy 2 may be viewed as more lenient, potentially leading to confusion among students about the boundaries of phone use and resulting in rule violations.

It is essential for students to be educated on their responsibilities when using phones or gadgets at school, regardless of the policy in place. Policy 1 stands out for clearly outlining boundaries from the beginning, giving students the necessary information to comply with the rules. In contrast, Policy 2 may make it challenging for students to be aware of the limits, increasing the likelihood of rule violations.

In summary, Policy 1 is the better choice for students to avoid breaking school rules. It establishes clear expectations and helps students understand their responsibilities better, reducing the risk of violations. Understanding the limitations of phone use in school is crucial for students.",1
430,"Dear Principal,

I am writing to discuss the proposal of making community service mandatory for all students. While community service has numerous benefits for both students and the community, enforcing it as a requirement may diminish its positive impact and go against its intended purpose.

Community service provides students with valuable real-world experience and helps them develop essential life skills like teamwork, communication, problem-solving, and empathy. By assisting those in need, students learn the importance of giving back and may develop a lifelong commitment to service. Additionally, the community benefits from the extra help provided by students, which addresses unmet needs and promotes civic engagement among youth.

However, making community service compulsory runs the risk of reducing its effectiveness. If students feel obligated rather than passionate about their projects, the experience may not be as fulfilling or meaningful. Forced participation may also result in less value and enthusiasm from volunteers. Instead of mandating community service for graduation, I believe it should remain optional for those who are interested. Educating students about volunteer opportunities and incentivizing participation through award programs could encourage more natural involvement. For those who are not inclined to participate, alternative avenues for gaining experience and building character could be offered.

Ultimately, community engagement is most impactful when it stems from personal conviction rather than external mandates. By keeping community service voluntary but strongly encouraged, our school allows students to serve according to their own interests and abilities, benefiting causes they are passionate about. This approach fosters lifelong citizens who give back willingly. For these reasons, I do not support making community service a requirement for all students.

435,"Advantages of Restricting Car Usage

Restricting car usage offers various benefits for individuals and the environment, as demonstrated by the experiences of different communities worldwide that have embraced car-free living. For instance, in Vauban, Germany, most streets are car-free except for the main road. Consequently, a majority of families in Vauban do not own cars, and many residents have sold their cars to move to the community. The residents of Vauban have identified several advantages of limiting car usage.

Firstly, reducing car usage promotes a healthier lifestyle. Residents in Vauban have reported increased happiness and reduced stress since they no longer rely on cars. Walking and cycling have become the primary modes of transportation, leading to more physical activity and improved fitness. Additionally, the absence of cars on the streets has created a quieter and more peaceful environment, allowing residents to enjoy the tranquility of the community.

Secondly, limiting car usage helps to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars account for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-heavy areas in the US, this number can be as high as 50%. By restricting car usage, communities like Vauban can make a significant impact in reducing their carbon footprint and addressing climate change.

Thirdly, limiting car usage encourages the development of more sustainable and accessible communities. In Vauban, stores are conveniently located within walking distance along a main street, eliminating the need for cars to access daily necessities. Similarly, in other car-free communities like Bogota, Colombia, millions of people have embraced alternative transportation methods like walking, biking, or taking buses to work, reducing traffic congestion and creating more vibrant cities.

Lastly, the trend of limiting car usage is gaining momentum globally. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency is advocating for car-reduced communities, and there are expectations for public transportation to play a larger role in future transportation plans. Recent studies also indicate that Americans are purchasing fewer cars and driving less, which could have positive effects on carbon emissions and the environment.

In conclusion, restricting car usage offers numerous advantages, including promoting a healthier lifestyle, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, creating more sustainable communities, and enhancing overall quality of life. As more communities embrace car-free living, it becomes clear that limiting car usage benefits both individuals and the environment. It is time for us to reconsider our reliance on cars and embrace alternative transportation methods for a more sustainable future.",1
436,"I believe that driverless cars are a negative concept. While they may appear to be a technological advancement, they present numerous risks and dangers to society.

To begin with, driverless cars are not infallible. They depend on complex technology that can malfunction at any time, leading to accidents and even fatalities.

For instance, in 2018, a self-driving Uber car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona, demonstrating that driverless cars are not entirely safe and can harm innocent individuals.

Additionally, driverless cars have the potential to result in job losses. The article mentions that the trucking industry could be significantly affected by the introduction of driverless cars. If trucks become automated, many truck drivers could lose their jobs, impacting not only the individuals employed in the trucking industry but also their families who depend on their income.

Lastly, driverless cars could lead to a loss of privacy. The article explains that driverless cars are equipped with sensors and cameras that gather data about the car's surroundings, including information about the passengers. This raises concerns about who can access this data and how it will be utilized.

438,"Loyalty is a highly valued trait that is often praised in various aspects of life, from personal relationships to professional endeavors. However, it can be argued that excessive loyalty can have detrimental effects and lead to harmful actions. While loyalty can be a positive force in certain situations, its potential for negative consequences should not be ignored.

One example of loyalty becoming destructive is seen in cases of blind allegiance to a leader or authority figure. History has shown numerous instances where individuals blindly followed their leaders, even when it meant committing atrocities or engaging in unethical behavior. This type of loyalty not only harms others but can also lead to self-destructive actions as individuals may sacrifice their own well-being or values to remain loyal.

Similarly, loyalty to an institution, such as a school or workplace, can also have negative effects. In some cases, employees or students may feel pressured to remain loyal to their institution even when they are unhappy or mistreated. This can create a toxic environment where loyalty is prioritized over well-being, leading to a lack of dissent and hindering necessary changes.

However, it is important to note that loyalty can also have positive effects. Loyalty to friends or family can strengthen relationships and provide support in times of need. Loyalty to a cause or belief can motivate individuals to work towards a greater good and stand up for what they believe in. Additionally, loyalty to an employer or institution can lead to a sense of dedication and pride in one's work, benefiting both the individual and the organization.

Ultimately, the impact of loyalty depends on how it is expressed and the context in which it is used. Blind loyalty, especially to an individual or institution, can be harmful and lead to destructive actions.

I am writing to express my support for the abolition of the Electoral College. I believe that this institution, created in 1787, is outdated and undemocratic, no longer meeting the needs of the American people. Originally established as a compromise between different views on how the president should be elected, the Electoral College has served its purpose for many years. However, with the United States now being a much larger and more diverse country, it is no longer fair for the president to be elected by a small group of electors who are not directly accountable to the people.

Furthermore, the Electoral College gives an unfair advantage to small states, as each state, regardless of population, has two senators and at least one representative in the House of Representatives. This results in small states having a disproportionate number of electoral votes compared to their population. This system also discourages voter participation, as many feel that their vote does not matter in states that are considered ""safe"" for one party or the other.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is no longer serving the needs of the American people and should be abolished in favor of electing the president by popular vote. I urge you to support this change.

Venus, the second planet from the sun, presents extreme conditions that make it a challenging world to explore. With surface temperatures exceeding 800 degrees Fahrenheit, a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, high pressure, and powerful winds, Venus is considered one of the harshest environments in our solar system. Despite these daunting challenges, a dedicated group of scientists believe that studying Venus could offer valuable insights and rewards that outweigh the risks.

444,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my strong support for eliminating the Electoral College and instead electing the President through a popular vote.

The Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that is not suitable for the 21st century. It unfairly values the votes of some citizens over others and has been used to disenfranchise many Americans.

In the most recent presidential election, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes but lost the election because she did not secure the majority of electoral votes. This is due to the Electoral College giving an advantage to smaller states.

Each state is given a certain number of electoral votes based on its population, but even the smallest states have at least three electoral votes, regardless of their population. This means that voters in smaller states have more voting power than those in larger states.

For example, a voter in Wyoming has about three times the voting power of a voter in California because of the difference in population and electoral votes.

The Electoral College also favors the Republican Party, as they rely on winning votes from rural voters in smaller states who tend to be more conservative.

The system has led to multiple instances where the candidate who won the popular vote did not win the election, including in 2016 when Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump despite winning the popular vote.

The Electoral College is not in line with the current American electorate and disenfranchises many citizens. I urge you to support a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College and move towards a popular vote system to ensure that every American's vote is equally valued in presidential elections.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

This quote highlights the idea that success is not easily attained without facing challenges, setbacks, and difficult times. It requires individuals to have the resilience and determination to overcome obstacles and continue moving forward. Challenges are necessary for personal growth and development, as they push us to think critically, problem-solve, and learn from our experiences. Embracing challenges with a positive mindset and a willingness to learn is key to overcoming them effectively.

446,"Cars are a widely used form of transportation worldwide, with almost everyone owning or having access to one. However, the excessive reliance on cars is having negative effects on the environment and our health. It is essential for people to reduce their car usage in order to reap the benefits that come with it. There are numerous advantages to limiting car usage that individuals should be aware of.

One benefit of cutting back on car usage is the reduction of harmful emissions that cars release into the air. These emissions, such as carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide, can lead to respiratory issues and other health problems. By using cars less frequently, fewer emissions will be released, resulting in a healthier environment and population.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the alleviation of traffic congestion. As more people rely on cars for transportation, the number of cars on the road increases, causing congestion and delays. By reducing car usage, traffic congestion can be minimized, leading to smoother traffic flow and decreased fuel consumption and emissions.

Additionally, reducing car usage can promote physical activity. Choosing to walk, bike, or use public transportation can provide individuals with the opportunity to engage in physical activity, which is beneficial for overall health and well-being. It can also serve as a stress-relieving and enjoyable way to travel.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous benefits, including reducing pollution, alleviating traffic congestion, and promoting physical activity. It is important for individuals to consider alternative modes of transportation that are environmentally friendly and beneficial for their health. By making changes to reduce car usage, we can all contribute to a cleaner and healthier environment for future generations.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to share my thoughts on the Electoral College and advocate for its continuation as the method for electing the President of the United States. Despite calls for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College should be upheld for several reasons, as outlined in various sources.

One key benefit of the Electoral College, as emphasized by Judge Richard A. Poster in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" is the certainty it provides in determining the election outcome. This system typically results in the winning candidate securing more Electoral College votes than their share of the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the results. In contrast, a direct popular vote could lead to close contests and potential controversies over vote counting, as seen in the 2000 election.

Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the entire nation by requiring candidates to have broad regional appeal to secure the necessary 270 electoral votes. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on densely populated areas or specific regions, encouraging them to address the concerns of all Americans. It promotes a balanced approach to governance and minimizes the risk of regional disenfranchisement.

The system also highlights swing states, prompting candidates to concentrate their campaign efforts on states where the outcome is uncertain. This increased attention encourages voters in swing states to engage more deeply with candidates' policies and positions, fostering a democracy that values informed decision making.

Furthermore, the Electoral College maintains a balance of power between small and large states, preventing larger states from overpowering smaller ones in presidential elections. By granting electoral votes based on population, the system gives small states a greater influence than they would have in a purely popular vote system, aligning with the principles of federalism.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections by consistently producing a clear winner in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This ensures a smooth transition of power and upholds stability in our democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system offers numerous advantages that justify its retention for selecting the President of the United States. While reforms may be considered, such as improvements to the winnertakeall system, the fundamental principles of the Electoral College should be preserved to safeguard the integrity and efficacy of our democracy.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective on this issue. I hope that you will take these arguments into consideration as you deliberate on the future of the Electoral College.

448,"I believe that students should have the opportunity to evaluate their teachers. It is crucial for teachers to receive feedback on their performance in order to know how they are doing and where they can improve. Students are the ones who interact with the teacher on a daily basis and have firsthand experience of the teaching methods being used.

Allowing students to grade their teachers can lead to improvements in teaching quality. If students identify areas where a teacher is lacking, the teacher can make necessary adjustments to enhance their teaching. For instance, if students feel that a teacher's explanations are unclear, they can provide this feedback and the teacher can work on improving their communication skills. This process can ultimately benefit both the teacher and the students.

Furthermore, this practice promotes accountability among teachers. Knowing that they are being evaluated by their students can motivate teachers to put in more effort and ensure that they are delivering lessons effectively. This accountability can result in teachers being more dedicated to their profession and striving to provide the best education possible.

Additionally, giving students the opportunity to grade their teachers empowers them and allows them to have a voice in their education. This involvement can increase student engagement and motivation, as they feel more invested in their learning. When students know that their opinions matter and can impact their learning environment, they are more likely to actively participate in class and take ownership of their education.

While some may argue that students may not be qualified to assess their teachers, I believe that students are the ones most affected by the teaching quality and are therefore capable of providing valuable feedback. Ultimately, allowing students to grade their teachers can lead to a more effective and student-centered learning environment where both teachers and students can thrive.",1

Additionally, students gain a diverse knowledge base by studying various subjects like history, science, and literature, which can be advantageous in their future careers. For instance, a lawyer with a history degree may have a better understanding of historical cases, while a doctor with a biology degree may be more adept at treating complex medical conditions. Ultimately, a university education offers practical and theoretical benefits by preparing students for employment and providing them with a broad knowledge base applicable to any field.",1
451,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my strong support for eliminating the Electoral College. This system assigns electors to each state based on its representation in Congress, with voters in each state choosing electors pledged to a presidential candidate. I believe the Electoral College is outdated and undemocratic, as it gives more weight to the votes of people in small states and can result in a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the election. I urge you to support replacing it with a direct popular vote for president, which would be the fairest and most democratic way to elect our nation's leader.

Allowing any form of cell phone use while driving can lead to increasingly distracted behavior over time. Therefore, a total ban on cell phone use while driving is necessary to promote road safety. Drivers should prioritize focusing on driving and refrain from using cell phones until safely parked.",1
454,"Hey there! Failure is really frustrating, you know? Even when you try your best, sometimes you don't get the result you were hoping for, and it can be really disappointing. But Winston Churchill once said that failure is actually crucial for success, and I'm curious to see if that's true.

Firstly, failure can teach you valuable lessons. When you fail, you learn what didn't work and can make adjustments for next time. You can also learn from the mistakes of others to avoid making the same errors.

Failure can also help you develop resilience. When you fail, you may feel discouraged, but you can use that experience to motivate yourself to do better next time. It's important not to let failure hold you back, but to keep pushing forward towards your goals.

Failure can also be humbling. It can make you realize that you're not perfect, but that's okay. You can still learn and grow from your failures and work towards achieving your goals, even if it's not a smooth journey.

In conclusion, Churchill was right when he said that ""Success is not final, failure is."" Failure is a necessary part of the journey towards success.",1
455,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my strong support for maintaining the Electoral College as the current method of selecting the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of switching to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a fair and effective way to choose the President.

One of the key benefits of the Electoral College is the certainty it provides in determining the outcome of the election. Although there have been instances where a candidate won the popular vote but lost the election, this has only occurred five times in U.S. history and is unlikely to happen again. This certainty is crucial for a peaceful transfer of power and ensures that the President is elected by the entire nation, not just a few large cities or states.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to appeal to a broad range of voters across different regions. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on a narrow group of voters in large cities or states. This regional appeal is important in ensuring that the President represents the entire country.

The Electoral College also gives swing states greater importance in presidential campaigns. Candidates must concentrate their efforts on states that are likely to be swing states, ensuring that all voters have a say in the election. This helps in electing a President who represents the entire nation.

In addition to practical reasons, there are political arguments for maintaining the Electoral College. Some believe that a popular vote system could still be influenced by special interests and money. There are concerns that a popular vote system could lead to a candidate only needing to win in a few large cities or states to secure victory.

While there are arguments in favor of switching to a popular vote system, I believe that these arguments are flawed. While a popular vote system may appear more democratic, it could potentially lead to a situation where a candidate only needs to focus on winning in densely populated areas to secure victory.",1
456,"I believe we should all consider adopting a vegan lifestyle, Ahab. Eating meat is harmful to the environment and our health. For example, it takes a significant amount of water to produce food for animals, with 1,000 gallons needed to make just one pound of beef. This water could be used to help those in need. Additionally, raising animals for meat production takes up a lot of space and contributes to pollution of the soil and air. Instead, we should focus on eating plants, which are better for us and the environment. Plants are delicious too! Have you ever tried tofu? It's versatile and can be added to many dishes. 

Furthermore, consuming meat can have negative effects on our health. I know someone who developed heart disease due to their high meat consumption. After switching to a vegan diet, they saw significant improvements in their health. My own mother used to eat a lot of meat and now has diabetes, but since incorporating more plants into her diet, she feels better. I want to avoid these health issues, so I plan to eat more plants as well.

Some may argue that we need meat for protein, but there are plenty of plant-based sources of protein such as beans and lentils. They are nutritious and delicious. And while some may think going vegan is difficult because of certain food restrictions, it is not as challenging as it seems. You can still enjoy pizza and pasta without meat toppings, and there are plenty of tasty vegan desserts available. Have you ever tried vegan chocolate chip cookies? They are amazing!

In conclusion, transitioning to a vegan diet is beneficial for both the environment and our health. It is not as difficult as it may seem and offers a variety of delicious options. Let's all give it a try!",1
457,"As an eighth grade student, I have always been intrigued by the experiences of immigrants who have made their way to the United States. Through my research, I have discovered that these individuals have encountered various difficulties that have tested their strength and perseverance. Despite these challenges, they have shown incredible resilience and have emerged as some of the most resilient individuals in the world.

One such example is Ellis Island, which served as a point of entry for millions of immigrants arriving in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These individuals left behind everything they knew and loved, including their families, friends, and homes, to embark on a new journey. They faced long lines, harsh weather conditions, and uncertainty about their future upon arrival. Additionally, they encountered hostility, discrimination, and were often forced to take on low-paying jobs or live in overcrowded tenements.

Nevertheless, the immigrants who passed through Ellis Island were able to overcome these challenges and establish new lives for themselves and their loved ones. They worked tirelessly, often in hazardous and physically demanding occupations, and saved up to start their own businesses or purchase homes. They also formed close-knit communities that provided support during difficult times.

Another example of immigrant resilience is seen in the story of the Dreamers, young individuals who were brought to the United States as children and have grown up in the country. Like other immigrants, they have faced discrimination, deportation threats, and uncertainty about their future. Despite these obstacles, they have continued to pursue education, work hard, and contribute positively to their communities. They have also become advocates for themselves and their families, advocating for their rights and striving to create a more inclusive and welcoming society.

The experiences of immigrants in the United States highlight that success is not about avoiding failure, but rather about persevering through setbacks with unwavering determination. As Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This sentiment rings especially true for immigrants, who have encountered numerous challenges and setbacks but have shown remarkable resilience, resourcefulness, and determination in building new lives for themselves and their families.

In conclusion, the stories of immigrants who have come to the United States serve as a powerful testament to the strength and resilience of individuals who have faced adversity and emerged stronger on the other side.",1
458,"The ""Face on Mars"" is not evidence of alien visitation, but rather a natural landform. Initial speculation about the vague facial features seen in early NASA photos has been debunked through further study, which has shown the formation to be a result of geology, not intelligence. Higher resolution images from later NASA missions revealed that the supposed eyes, nose, and mouth were actually random cracks and slopes, not intentional design. The composition of the region, primarily sandstone and basalt, provides a geological explanation for the landform's shape, similar to landscapes found in the American Southwest. The lack of any other artifacts or evidence of civilization near the ""Face"" further supports the conclusion that it is simply a natural formation. While the human tendency to see patterns may lead some to believe in alien involvement, scientific scrutiny shows that the ""Face on Mars"" is just another curious rock outcropping shaped by natural forces over time. Future observations of Mars will likely uncover more strange landforms, but none will require alien intervention to explain their origin. The ""Face"" serves as a reminder of how easily our minds can perceive the paranormal in natural geography.",1
459,"Failure is a common experience that we all face at some point in our lives. How we react to failure is what truly matters. Last year, I failed to meet a challenge during a school project, which had a significant impact on both myself and a friend.

Looking back, I realize that I could have taken the initiative to start earlier, communicated better with my group, and sought help if needed. The consequences of not taking these actions were receiving a low grade and missing out on learning about an important historical event. My friend who relied on me also felt let down.

In conclusion, failure teaches us valuable lessons. By reflecting on our mistakes and taking corrective action, we can overcome failure and achieve success. Though I failed to complete the project successfully, I have learned from this experience and will strive to do better in the future.",1
460,"Title: Advantages and Obstacles of Car-Free Cities

Introduction:
Envision a world where automobiles are a rare sight in urban areas. A place where individuals rely on public transportation, biking, or walking instead of driving. These urban areas are known as car-free cities. This essay will explore the advantages of residing in a car-free environment, the obstacles that come with it, and the necessary measures to achieve a completely car-free city.

Advantages of Car-Free Cities:
1. Enhanced air quality: With fewer vehicles on the road, air pollution levels decrease significantly, leading to improved health and a lower risk of respiratory and heart conditions for residents.
2. Reduced traffic congestion and noise: A decrease in cars results in less traffic, noise, and congestion on streets, creating a more pleasant environment for inhabitants.

4. Environmental benefits: Car-free cities contribute to lower greenhouse gas emissions and oil consumption, crucial for addressing climate change concerns globally.
5. Decreased reliance on oil: By reducing the use of personal vehicles, car-free cities can lessen their dependence on foreign oil and become more self-sufficient.

Challenges of Car-Free Cities:
1. Insufficient public transportation: A well-functioning public transportation system is essential for the success of car-free cities. Without reliable public transportation, residents may face inconvenience.
2. Lack of infrastructure: Establishing a car-free city requires significant infrastructure changes, such as creating bike lanes and pedestrian walkways, which can be costly and time-consuming.
3. Limited accessibility: Car-free cities may pose challenges for individuals with disabilities or the elderly, impacting social inclusion and equity.
4. Economic impact: Car-free cities could negatively affect local businesses by reducing foot traffic, potentially leading to job losses and economic challenges in certain areas.

Steps Towards Car-Free Cities:
1. Enhance public transportation and cycling infrastructure: Cities should invest in expanding public transportation options and building more bike lanes and pedestrian walkways.
2. Promote car-sharing and ride-sharing services: Offering alternatives to private car ownership, such as car-sharing and ride-sharing services, can help reduce the number of vehicles on the road.
3. Increase awareness: Educating the public about the benefits of car-free living through campaigns, events, and social media outreach is crucial.
4. Incentivize alternative transportation modes.",1
461,"Extracurricular activities play a crucial role in a student's life, offering opportunities to develop skills, make friends, and impress colleges. The choice to participate in these activities is typically up to the students and their families. This essay will explore the advantages and disadvantages of students making decisions about extracurricular involvement.

On one hand, students should have the freedom to select activities that interest them and fit their schedules. For instance, some students may opt out of activities that require too much time and interfere with their studies.

On the other hand, extracurricular activities can enhance academic performance and future prospects by fostering skills like leadership and teamwork. Colleges often seek well-rounded students with extracurricular involvement, so students who choose not to participate may miss out on opportunities.

Moreover, extracurricular activities can foster a sense of community and belonging, allowing students to form lasting friendships and find fulfillment outside of academics.

In conclusion, while students should have the autonomy to choose activities that align with their interests, the impact of extracurricular involvement on academic performance and future opportunities should be considered. Ultimately, students should be encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities, but the decision should be made by the individual and their family.",1

464,"This subject is contentious, as individuals hold varying opinions on how grades for extracurricular activities should be determined. Some argue that grades should be based solely on participation and attendance, while others believe they should reflect performance and achievement. In this essay, I will contend that grades for extracurricular activities should consider a combination of participation, attendance, and achievement.

Participation is crucial in extracurricular activities as it demonstrates commitment and engagement. Without active involvement, individuals cannot fully contribute to the success of the activity. Therefore, participation should be a key factor in grading extracurricular activities.

While participation is important, attendance also plays a significant role. Consistent absence can hinder the progress of the group and impact overall success. Therefore, attendance should also be factored into grading extracurricular activities.

Furthermore, achievement is essential in determining grades for extracurricular activities. This includes both the success of the activity itself and the individual's contribution to that success. Those who consistently contribute and help achieve goals should be rewarded with higher grades.

It is important to recognize that the importance of each factor may vary depending on the nature of the activity. For instance, community service projects may prioritize participation and attendance, while sports teams may prioritize achievement and performance. Therefore, the weight assigned to each factor should be tailored to the specific activity.

In conclusion, grades for extracurricular activities should be based on a combination of participation, attendance, and achievement. This approach ensures that individuals are committed, present, and contributing to the success of the activity. By considering all these factors, a fair and effective grading system can be established for extracurricular activities.",1
465,"As an eighth grade student, I believe that schools should have some say in how much students are involved in extracurricular activities. While these activities are beneficial for personal growth and socialization, they can also impact academic performance and cause distractions in the classroom.

Participating in extracurricular activities allows students to explore interests, develop skills, and build confidence, teamwork, and leadership abilities. These activities can also provide a sense of community and belonging, especially for students who may be struggling academically or socially.

However, too much involvement in extracurricular activities can lead to difficulties in balancing commitments and maintaining grades. These activities can also be distracting in the classroom, as students may be preoccupied with upcoming practices or meetings instead of focusing on their studies.

Schools may have different priorities and goals for their students, which may not always align with the emphasis on extracurricular involvement. For instance, a school may prioritize academic achievement over participation in clubs or organizations, potentially leading to a lack of support for certain activities.

In conclusion, while extracurricular activities are valuable for personal growth and socialization, schools should have some control over student involvement to ensure a balance between commitments and academic performance, while still providing opportunities for personal development and community building.",1
466,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my strong support for eliminating the Electoral College and instead electing the President of the United States through a popular vote. I believe that this change would be more democratic, fair, and reflective of the will of the people.

The Electoral College is an outdated system that was established over 200 years ago to give more power to smaller states, but it no longer serves that purpose. In reality, it gives more power to the 11 most populous states, which are already overrepresented in Congress.

The Electoral College also allows for a president to be elected despite losing the popular vote, as seen in five instances in our history, most recently in 2016. This is unjust and demonstrates that the Electoral College is not functioning as intended.

A popular vote system would be much more democratic and fair, ensuring that every vote is counted equally regardless of location. It would also provide each state with equal representation, with each state having one vote. This change would be a significant step towards making our government more representative of the people.

I urge you to support the abolition of the Electoral College. This change would greatly improve our democracy and make our government more fair and representative of the people.

467,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to share my views on the Electoral College system and its role in electing the President of the United States. While some argue for getting rid of the Electoral College and choosing the President through a popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College is a just and efficient system that should be kept.

One key argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures a definite outcome. Although there have been a few instances in U.S. history where a candidate won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote, this is rare. On the other hand, winning the popular vote does not guarantee the presidency, as seen in the 2000 and 2016 elections. By having a system where electors ultimately determine the outcome, the Electoral College provides a level of certainty that a popular vote system lacks.

Another argument in support of the Electoral College is that it forces candidates to appeal to a broad range of voters across different regions. In a popular vote system, candidates might only focus on winning in their home region, ignoring other parts of the country. By needing to win in multiple regions to secure the presidency, candidates are pushed to appeal to a wider variety of voters, resulting in a more representative government.

Moreover, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in swing states. In a popular vote system, candidates might concentrate solely on winning in large urban areas, neglecting smaller rural areas. By needing to win in swing states, candidates are compelled to pay attention to all regions of the country, leading to a more balanced and representative government.

Additionally, the Electoral College system gives some importance to large states. In a popular vote system, the votes of large states could be overshadowed by those of smaller states. By assigning each state a proportional number of electoral votes based on its population, the Electoral College ensures that the voices of all states are considered.

Lastly, the Electoral College system avoids the issue of elections where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. In a popular vote system, a candidate could win the popular vote but still lose the presidency if no candidate gets a majority of the votes. By having a system where electors ultimately determine the outcome, the Electoral College ensures that there is a clear winner.

In conclusion, despite arguments for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College is a fair and effective system that should be maintained. By providing certainty of outcome, requiring candidates to have transregional appeal, encouraging candidates to campaign in swing states, giving weight to large states, and avoiding the issue of no majority winner, the Electoral College serves an important role in our electoral process.",1
468,"Although distance learning offers flexibility for some students, attending classes in person provides advantages that are more conducive to student growth and success. Learning in a classroom setting allows for important social interactions that cannot be replicated in distance learning. Students benefit from collaboration, discussions, and peer interactions that enhance their learning experience. They also receive immediate feedback from both teachers and classmates, helping them develop important social skills such as cooperation, empathy, and respect. These interpersonal skills are crucial for healthy development and will benefit students long after their school years.

Furthermore, in-person classes offer a structured environment that many students require. Distance learning can lead to distractions at home and falling behind without the external discipline of scheduled classes. The classroom setting holds students accountable and provides support from teachers and peers to help them stay on track. It also promotes focus by removing everyday distractions and creating an atmosphere conducive to learning.

Overall, while distance learning may offer flexibility, attending classes in person provides key benefits that are essential for student growth. The social experiences, immediate feedback, and structured environment of the classroom better support learning goals and the development of skills necessary for future success. Therefore, in most cases, in-person classes are preferable to distance learning from home. However, distance learning can be a suitable alternative for exceptional circumstances or to complement in-person classes.

The Face on Mars has intrigued many for years, with some believing it was made by aliens. However, after reading ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" it is evident that the Face is a natural landform, not created by extraterrestrial beings. This essay will argue that the Face on Mars is a natural formation, using evidence from the article to support this claim.

Body:
The article explains that the Face on Mars is a result of natural geological processes, shaped by wind, water, and other factors over millions of years. This means it was formed naturally, without alien intervention.

Additionally, the article points out that similar landforms can be found on Earth, such as the Badlands of South Dakota, indicating that the Face on Mars is not unique but rather a common feature in our solar system.

Furthermore, the article shows that the Face on Mars has evolved over time, undergoing significant changes since it was first observed in the 1970s. This suggests that it is a dynamic landform shaped by natural processes.

Lastly, the article dispels the idea that the Face on Mars is a perfect replica of a human face, stating that it is simply a natural formation that resembles a face. This indicates that it is not a deliberate creation but rather a coincidental resemblance.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Face on Mars is not the work of aliens but a natural landform shaped by geological processes over millions of years. Evidence from ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" supports this argument, showing that the Face is a common feature, has changed over time, and is not a perfect human face replica. Therefore, it is clear that the Face on Mars is a natural formation, not an alien creation.",1
476,"In today's society, possessing knowledge in various academic subjects is seen as crucial. However, some argue that focusing on one specific subject is more beneficial. Despite the advantages of both approaches, I strongly believe that having a wide range of knowledge in multiple academic areas is more advantageous. In this essay, I will explain why I hold this view and provide examples to support it.

478,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for maintaining the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. I believe that the Electoral College is a fair and representative system that ensures all states have a voice in the presidential election.

The Electoral College allocates electors to each state based on its number of senators and representatives in Congress. This ensures that smaller states have a greater say in the election compared to a popular vote system. By preventing large states from dominating the election, the Electoral College ensures that all states have a stake in the outcome.

While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and should be replaced with a popular vote system, I believe it is still the best way to elect the President. It maintains fairness and representation for all states, preventing larger states from controlling the election.

Thank you for your time.

480,"In today's education system, the emphasis is often on memorizing facts rather than grasping underlying concepts and ideas. However, I firmly believe that it is crucial for students to comprehend ideas and concepts over simply memorizing information. In this essay, I will present arguments and examples to support my viewpoint.

To begin with, understanding ideas and concepts lays a solid groundwork for future learning. When students grasp the fundamental principles and concepts, they can apply them to various situations and contexts, enabling them to think critically and solve problems creatively. For instance, a student who understands the concept of gravity can utilize it in different scenarios, such as calculating building heights or comprehending planetary motion.

Moreover, understanding ideas and concepts facilitates long-term retention of knowledge. While memorizing facts may lead to forgetting soon after exams, comprehending the concepts behind the facts ensures that the knowledge remains with students for an extended period. For example, a student who understands the concept of photosynthesis is more likely to remember the process and its significance in the ecosystem, rather than just memorizing the steps involved.

Additionally, understanding ideas and concepts enables students to establish connections between various subjects and disciplines. By comprehending the underlying principles of a subject, students can recognize how it relates to other fields like math, science, and history. This interdisciplinary understanding not only aids them in academic pursuits but also in future careers. For instance, a student who understands physics principles can apply them to fields like engineering or architecture.

Lastly, understanding ideas and concepts fosters creativity and innovation. When students are encouraged to think critically and grasp fundamental principles, they are more likely to generate new and innovative ideas. This is because they are not confined by facts and can think beyond existing knowledge. For example, a student who understands renewable energy concepts may devise an innovative solution for harnessing solar power.

In conclusion, I strongly advocate for prioritizing the understanding of ideas and concepts over memorizing facts in education. This approach not only establishes a strong foundation for future learning but also promotes long-term retention of knowledge, facilitates connections between different subjects, and encourages creativity and innovation. Therefore, educators should focus on teaching concepts and ideas rather than solely focusing on facts.",1
481,"As members of our community, it is crucial to reduce the reliance on cars in order to enhance air quality, alleviate traffic congestion, and protect the environment. By utilizing the information provided and addressing potential opposing viewpoints, we can effectively convey the significance of minimizing car usage.

Thesis: Restricting the use of cars can greatly enhance air quality, alleviate traffic congestion, and have positive effects on the environment.

In the first passage, it is discussed how ""Car-Free Cities"" such as Vauban in Germany have successfully improved air quality by prohibiting cars and promoting alternative transportation methods. This is important because car emissions are a major contributor to air pollution, which poses health risks, especially for vulnerable populations. By reducing car usage, we can decrease the amount of harmful pollutants in the air, creating a healthier living environment for our community.

The second passage illustrates the impact of car usage on traffic congestion in Paris, where a partial driving ban was implemented to combat smog. The passage reveals that after five days of the ban, congestion in the city decreased by 60%. This reduction in congestion leads to more efficient use of time and resources, as individuals can travel more quickly and reliably without relying on cars.

The third passage discusses the advantages of a car-free day in Bogotá, Colombia, where millions of people opted to walk, bike, or use public transportation instead of driving to work. Despite occasional rain showers, a large number of individuals participated in this event, demonstrating that viable alternatives to driving exist and that people are willing to embrace these alternatives when given the opportunity.

Opposing View: Some individuals may argue that limiting car use is impractical or unfeasible, especially in areas with limited access to public transportation.",1
482,"Dear [State Senator],

I am writing to share my views on the Electoral College system and its importance in the presidential election process. While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and unfair, I firmly believe that it plays a vital role in our democratic system.

One key argument in support of the Electoral College is that it guarantees a definitive outcome. Unlike a popular vote system where a candidate could win an election with a simple majority, the Electoral College requires a candidate to secure a majority of electoral votes. This ensures that the president-elect has widespread support across the country and is not just favored by a single region or demographic. As Bradford Plume states in his article ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" ""a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote"" (Para. 1).

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes candidates to have a national appeal. Without it, a candidate could focus solely on a specific region and still win the presidency. However, with the Electoral College, candidates must appeal to a broader audience to secure victory. As Judge Richard A. Poster argues in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised"" (Para. 3).

Moreover, the Electoral College system incentivizes candidates to campaign heavily in swing states, which are states that could swing either way in an election. This means that voters in these states are more likely to closely follow the campaign and make an informed decision.",1
483,"When it comes to competition, some believe that it is beneficial for children to learn how to compete as it teaches them valuable qualities like resilience and discipline.

While teaching children to cooperate is important, competitive skills should not be overlooked as they can also lead to success and skill development.",1
484,"Dear Principal Smith,

I am writing to express my disagreement with the policy of requiring students to maintain a B average in order to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities at our school. While academic achievement is important, I believe that excluding students with a C average could have negative consequences on their involvement and success.

There are several reasons why I believe a B average requirement is not the best approach. Participation in extracurricular activities is crucial for many students' overall well-being and development, providing them with a necessary outlet and stress relief from their academic studies. Removing this opportunity could have a detrimental impact on students' mental health and overall happiness at school. Additionally, being part of a team or club teaches important skills such as time management, leadership, responsibility, and cooperation that cannot be learned in the classroom. Denying students this valuable learning experience could set them back in other areas.

For some students, a C average may be the result of their best effort in balancing academics and extracurricular activities. Not all students learn in the same way or have the same strengths, and a C grade may indicate that a student is genuinely trying their hardest. Excluding these dedicated students from activities could damage their confidence and motivation, potentially leading to cheating or a lack of effort to artificially inflate their grades.

Furthermore, prohibiting students with below a B average from participating in sports or clubs could have a negative impact on our school culture and community. Many events and traditions rely on the involvement of teams and groups, and losing engaged and passionate students could weaken our sense of unity and spirit. It may also discourage future students from getting involved if they believe they need to be perfect students.

In conclusion, I believe that requiring a B average as the threshold for participation in extracurricular activities is too restrictive and may do more harm than good. A C average demonstrates that students are passing their classes and making an effort to balance their responsibilities. I suggest a more flexible approach of reviewing students' performance on a case-by-case basis if their grades begin to slip below a C. This approach promotes inclusion while still prioritizing academics when serious issues arise. I urge you to reconsider implementing the new B average rule and instead maintain our current policy that values student participation in a variety of activities.

Thank you for considering my perspective. Please let me know if you have any further questions.

486,"Gun control is a contentious issue in many countries, with varying opinions on the matter. Personally, I believe that implementing stricter gun control laws is essential to safeguarding the well-being of citizens.

Firstly, research indicates that countries with stringent gun control measures experience lower rates of unrelated deaths and injuries, such as Australia following the enforcement of strict gun laws in 1996.

Secondly, the presence of firearms in households heightens the risk of accidental shootings and domestic violence, particularly affecting children. Stricter gun control regulations would help prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands.

Thirdly, easy access to firearms contributes to the occurrence of mass shootings, as seen in the United States. Implementing stricter gun control laws would make it harder for individuals with harmful intentions to acquire weapons.

Lastly, while the Second Amendment grants the right to bear arms, it does not mean unrestricted access to any type of weapon. The government has a duty to protect its citizens, and stricter gun control laws would aid in fulfilling this obligation.

In conclusion, stricter gun control laws are necessary to enhance citizen safety by reducing unrelated crimes and violence, preventing accidental shootings and domestic violence, and decreasing the likelihood of mass shootings. However, addressing gun violence requires a comprehensive approach that includes mental health initiatives, improved school security, and community-based violence prevention programs.

Overall, I believe that implementing stricter gun control laws is a positive step towards creating a safer society for all individuals.",1
487,"Advantages of Reducing Car Usage

489,"Venus, the second planet from the sun, has intrigued astronomers for its similarities to Earth in size and composition. Despite being called Earth's ""twin,"" Venus has distinct features that set it apart and make it a fascinating celestial body.

One major difference between Venus and Earth is its thick atmosphere, composed mainly of carbon dioxide and 96 times denser than Earth's atmosphere. This dense atmosphere creates extreme pressure, making it challenging to explore Venus's surface from space.

Another notable aspect of Venus is its scorching surface temperature, averaging around 864°F (462°C). This extreme heat is due to the planet's greenhouse gas-filled atmosphere, which traps heat and causes Venus to radiate more energy back into space than it receives from the sun. The intense heat and pressure on Venus make it nearly impossible for humans to visit, as metal components on spacecraft have melted.

Despite these harsh conditions, scientists have gained valuable insights into Venus through various exploratory missions. NASA's Mariner 2 mission in 1962 and the Magellan mission in the 1990s provided crucial data on Venus's atmosphere and geology. More recently, the Parker Solar Probe passed by Venus on its way to study the sun's outer atmosphere.

While much has been learned about Venus, there is still more to discover, and new missions are in the works. The ESA's EnVision mission, set to launch in the late 2020s, will focus on Venus's geology, atmosphere, and potential habitability.

Venus's unique characteristics, extreme environment, and scientific significance make it a vital subject for further exploration in our solar system.

490,"The debate between working in groups and working alone is a common topic among students, teachers, and parents. While some students prefer to work independently, most students favor working in groups. This essay will discuss the reasons why students prefer group work, examine the benefits and drawbacks of working in groups, explore how forming a group for a project can aid in its completion, consider the advantages of having a friend in a group to gather materials and data, and compare and contrast working in groups versus working alone.

One of the main reasons why students prefer working in groups is the sense of community and belonging it provides. Group work allows students to share ideas, collaborate on tasks, and support each other, which can be especially beneficial for those who feel isolated or disconnected from their peers. Additionally, working in groups helps students learn from each other and develop important social skills like communication and teamwork.

However, there are also disadvantages to working in groups. Group work can be less efficient than working alone, as students may need to compromise on ideas or work at a slower pace to accommodate their group members' needs. Managing group work can also be challenging, especially if members have different work styles or levels of commitment.

Despite these drawbacks, working in groups can help ensure the timely completion of a project by dividing tasks and responsibilities among group members. Group work also provides opportunities for students to learn leadership and problem-solving skills from their peers.

Having a friend in a group to assist with gathering materials and data can be advantageous. Working alone may make it difficult to gather all necessary resources for a project, but collaborating with a friend or group allows students to pool their resources and ensure that the project is comprehensive and addresses all relevant issues.

On the other hand, working alone gives students more control over their work and the flexibility to work at their own pace. This allows students to focus on their own ideas and work in a manner that suits them best.",1

Paris saw a significant decrease in congestion and improved air quality through strict driving restrictions during periods of high pollution. Bogotá celebrates car-free days annually, reducing air pollution and promoting alternative transportation methods. In the United States, changing behavior patterns and decreasing car ownership reflect a shift towards a more car-independent lifestyle, with initiatives like telecommuting and bike sharing programs. These examples show the benefits of rethinking our reliance on cars and moving towards a more sustainable and connected society.

494,"Here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th-grade student:

Hey everyone! Today we're discussing the idea that success comes from moving from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm. I think it's like, if you fail at something, you should keep trying until you succeed. For example, if you don't get the grade you want on a test, you shouldn't get discouraged and give up. Instead, you should study harder and try again.

One person that comes to mind is Thomas Edison. He's really famous for inventing the light bulb, but he failed many times before he succeeded. He once said, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" That's so cool! He didn't get upset when he failed, he just kept going until he made it.

However, some people believe that success doesn't come from failing repeatedly. They think it's more important to learn from your mistakes and move on. If you fail at something, you should take the time to figure out why you failed and then try again with what you've learned. That way, you're not making the same mistake over and over.

I think both arguments make sense. It's good to keep trying until you succeed, but it's also important to learn from your mistakes and move on. The key is to find a balance between the two. You should keep trying, but also take the time to figure out what went wrong and how you can do better next time.

In conclusion, I believe that success does come from moving from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm, but only if you're also willing to learn from your mistakes and keep trying. It's not about repeating the same mistakes over and over again. You need to find that balance and keep pushing forward until you succeed. Cool, right? (Note: This essay is intentionally written as a rough, unpolished draft to simulate the writing style of an 8th-grade student.)",1

Respect is another trait that I prioritize. I show respect to everyone, regardless of their position or relationship to me. I believe that respect is crucial in any workplace, and it is a quality that I always uphold. For instance, if I were to come to work in a bad mood and speak negatively to my colleagues, I could risk losing my job. Therefore, I always strive to maintain the best attitude possible, even when faced with challenging situations outside of work.

I am confident in my ability to handle any responsibilities that come my way. If given two stacks of paper and two days to fill them out, I would complete the task. I am also willing to follow orders or instructions, even if I may not agree with them. For example, if given the opportunity to work with kindergartners who are struggling to comprehend the material being taught, I would stay after school with them until they understood and were able to complete the task.

500,"Dear State Senator,

I am writing to share my stance on whether to keep the Electoral College or switch to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States. After reviewing the arguments in the assigned readings, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained.

One key reason for supporting the Electoral College is that it guarantees a clear outcome. Unlike a popular vote system, where a candidate could win without a majority of votes, the Electoral College ensures that the candidate who wins a state receives all of its electoral votes, avoiding confusion and controversy.

Another important factor in favor of the Electoral College is that it requires candidates to appeal to a wide range of voters across the country. In contrast, a popular vote system could lead candidates to focus only on densely populated areas, neglecting the needs of other regions. The Electoral College promotes a more inclusive campaign strategy.

Additionally, the Electoral College system emphasizes swing states, encouraging candidates to engage with voters in these crucial areas. This leads to a more representative democratic process and ensures that diverse interests are considered.

Moreover, the Electoral College balances the influence of large and small states, preventing larger states from dominating the election. This helps to ensure that the voices of all states are heard and considered in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming run-off elections that could decrease voter turnout. This system provides a clear and efficient way to determine the winner of the presidential election.

While some argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic, I believe that reforms such as changing the winner-take-all approach could address these concerns. In conclusion, I strongly advocate for maintaining the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States due to its certainty of outcome, broad appeal requirement for candidates, focus on swing states, balance of state influence, and avoidance of run-off elections. I urge you to consider these points when making decisions about the Electoral College system.

Moreover, traveling in a group can be enjoyable as it allows for meeting new people and forming friendships.

Another benefit of traveling in a group led by a tour guide is that it can be more cost-effective compared to traveling alone. Group discounts are often available for accommodations, meals, and activities. Additionally, the tour guide can negotiate better prices for the entire group.

However, there are also drawbacks to traveling in a group. For instance, there is less freedom and flexibility as you must adhere to the tour guide's schedule and may not be able to do everything you want. Furthermore, traveling in a group can sometimes be chaotic and stressful.

In conclusion, I believe that the advantages of traveling in a group led by a tour guide outweigh the disadvantages. If you are planning a trip, I suggest considering traveling in a group.",1
507,"Do you believe failure is a positive or negative thing? One British prime minister once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Some may view this as negative thinking because despite one's efforts, success may not be achieved. However, I agree with the statement about the important role failure plays in achieving success for three reasons. Firstly, failure helps individuals improve from where they started. For instance, when I first tried to learn guitar, I struggled and failed repeatedly until a friend showed me how to play. Despite continued failures, I persevered and eventually improved. Secondly, failure motivates individuals to keep going and not give up. Looking up to successful individuals like Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, and Oprah Winfrey, who faced rejection and criticism before achieving success, can provide motivation to overcome obstacles. Lastly, failure teaches individuals to overcome any challenges that may arise. For example, when I was eighteen, I faced a difficult situation but was able to overcome it through perseverance. In conclusion, failure can ultimately lead to growth, motivation, and the ability to overcome obstacles.",1
508,"Computer games have been in existence for a significant amount of time and have been utilized for various purposes. Some individuals believe that computer games have had more negative impacts than positive ones on the physical, intellectual, and psychological development of children. As a result, they recommend implementing measures to restrict children from playing them.

One major issue with computer games is their potential for addiction, leading children to become engrossed in playing them and finding it difficult to stop. This addiction can adversely affect children's overall development.

Another significant drawback of computer games is their tendency to be monotonous, causing children to lose interest and hindering their ability to learn. This lack of engagement can have detrimental effects on children's development in multiple areas.

There are also concerns that computer games pose dangers to children's physical, intellectual, and psychological well-being.

These issues can be harmful to children, emphasizing the need for effective measures to limit their exposure to computer games.",1

511,"Hey, it's me, just your average 8th grader! Today, I want to talk about the idea of graduating high school in three years, which I think is pretty cool. I never realized there were options like summer school, evening classes, or taking fewer electives to make it happen. I love learning new things, but I also don't want to be seen as an overachiever.

Let's get into it! One of the benefits of finishing high school early is being able to get your driver's license sooner. Who wouldn't want to hit the road with friends and have that sense of freedom? Plus, having a license can make it easier to find a job, like at the mall, and who wouldn't want some extra cash?

However, there are also some downsides to graduating early. You might miss out on important extracurricular activities or sports that can make high school memorable. I personally would want to be part of the basketball team or drama club. And if you're not involved, you might feel left out or like you're not having as much fun.

Another thing to think about is whether you'll be ready for college if you graduate early. College is expensive, and you want to make sure you're prepared to succeed. It's important to consider if you'll be able to keep up with the academic demands.

In conclusion, graduating high school in three years could be a good choice for some, but it's not for everyone. If you're motivated and can handle the workload, it might be a good fit. But if you prefer a more relaxed pace, it might be better to stick with the traditional four-year plan.",1
512,"As an eighth-grade student, I have come to understand that failure and mistakes play a crucial role in achieving success. Initially, I viewed failure as a negative experience, but as I have matured, I have realized that it can actually be beneficial. One way in which failure and mistakes can be advantageous is by providing valuable lessons. When we fail, we take the opportunity to reflect on what went wrong and how we can improve, leading to personal growth. By learning from our failures, we can enhance our problem-solving skills, decision-making abilities, and overall success. Furthermore, failure can motivate us to work harder and strive for improvement. Despite feeling discouraged, failure can push us to persevere and try again, ultimately leading to skill development and greater success in the future. Additionally, failure can help us build resilience by teaching us to bounce back from setbacks and continue pursuing our goals. In essence, failure and mistakes should be viewed as opportunities for growth and learning rather than negative experiences. By embracing failure, pushing ourselves to work harder, and developing resilience, we can ultimately achieve greater success in our endeavors. Next time you face failure, don't give up; instead, use it as a stepping stone towards achieving your goals.",1
513,"Dear Principal Smith,

I am writing to discuss THX school's current cell phone policy that is being reviewed. After careful consideration, I believe that Policy 1 is the best approach for THX school. This policy allows students to bring phones to school but requires them to be turned off during class time. Here are a few reasons why:

Responsibility. Policy 1 treats students as responsible young adults by allowing phones on campus with reasonable restrictions. Turning phones off during class shows respect for teaching and learning while still allowing students to stay connected outside of instructional time. Completely banning phones is too restrictive and does not encourage independence or responsibility.

Safety. For many students, having a cell phone provides peace of mind for parents and allows for contact in emergencies. While phones are not necessary during class, having access at lunch or between periods could be important in certain situations. Policy 2 eliminates this safety benefit for families.

Engagement. Limiting technology use to non-instructional times under Policy 1 is a fair compromise that allows social and recreational phone use without negatively impacting lessons. Total bans on phones may lead to frustration or disengagement that affects motivation and behavior at school. Allowing off-hours access strikes a better balance.

In conclusion, Policy 1 establishes a reasonable balance of responsibility, safety, and engagement for students while still respecting classroom academics. It reflects this generation's relationship with technology in a sensible manner. I believe that most students at our school would prefer this policy and are capable of following its common-sense guidelines. Thank you for considering my input on this important decision.

514,"The use of single-use plastics has become a significant environmental concern, as they are often discarded after one use and end up polluting our oceans and landfills. While some argue for the necessity of single-use plastics, I will advocate for their ban in this essay, providing reasons and examples to support my stance.

To begin with, single-use plastics are a major source of pollution, particularly in oceans where they harm marine life. For instance, plastic bags and straws are commonly mistaken for food by sea turtles, leading to digestive issues and physical harm. Without action to reduce plastic waste, the World Wildlife Fund warns that there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050.

Additionally, single-use plastics are unsustainable as they are made from finite resources like oil and gas. In contrast, reusable alternatives such as cloth bags and metal straws can be used multiple times, reducing the need for single-use plastics and conserving natural resources. By banning these products, we can lessen our reliance on fossil fuels and promote sustainability.

Furthermore, the argument that single-use plastics are necessary for convenience is refuted by the availability of sustainable alternatives. Reusable water bottles and cloth bags are just as easy to use and carry around, providing a convenient and eco-friendly option. By making the switch to reusable products, we can reduce our environmental impact without sacrificing convenience.

Lastly, banning single-use plastics will drive innovation towards more sustainable products. Companies will be incentivized to develop environmentally friendly alternatives, leading to new technologies that benefit both the environment and public health. For example, the development of biodegradable plastics shows promise in reducing plastic waste and promoting a cleaner future.

In conclusion, banning single-use plastics is crucial for protecting our environment from pollution, conserving resources, and encouraging innovation. By taking action to eliminate these products, we can reduce plastic waste, safeguard marine life, and pave the way for a more sustainable future. It is time for us to make a change and prioritize the health of our planet.",1
515," Restricting car usage can be beneficial for both individuals and the environment. For example, Vauban, a German suburb, has seen improved air quality and a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 70% after implementing car-free policies. Similarly, Paris banned cars for five days due to smog, resulting in a 60% decrease in congestion. Bogotá, Colombia also implemented a car-free day, which led to a large turnout and a reduction in air pollution. These examples illustrate how limiting car usage can improve air quality and reduce emissions.

Despite concerns about the negative impact on the economy and individual freedom, it is important to consider the broader benefits of restricting car usage. For instance, there is evidence that the number of miles driven in the United States is decreasing, suggesting a potential cultural shift away from car culture. This shift could have positive implications for the environment and society as a whole. Additionally, the popularity of car-sharing programs and biking initiatives provides alternative transportation options for those who may not have access to public transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for citizens and the environment. While there may be arguments against it, the benefits of reducing car usage extend beyond just improving air quality and reducing emissions.",1

Similarly, American Secret Service agents posing as Muslims demonstrate how assuming different identities can help in diffusing potentially dangerous situations by providing insight into unfamiliar cultures. In everyday life, changing identities can aid in adapting to different environments, leading to personal growth and the attainment of goals. By embracing the ability to become someone else, individuals can explore new opportunities and approach others with an open mind. Overall, there are numerous advantages to temporarily adopting different identities, including reaching goals, avoiding conflicts, and gaining a deeper understanding of diverse cultures and environments. It is crucial to recognize how this practice can enhance relationships and promote greater understanding.",1
520,"The Facial Action coding System technology discussed in the article aims to provide insight into students' emotions, but using it to analyze facial expressions in the classroom raises valid concerns.

This could infringe on students' privacy and become oppressive over time, leading to assumptions and oversimplification of complex emotions. Before widespread use, more research is needed on how this technology affects student wellbeing and the student-teacher relationship. While the goal of improving education is important, caution is necessary to avoid unintended negative consequences. Overall, the concerns outweigh the potential benefits, suggesting that classroom facial expression analysis may not be advisable at this time.",1
521,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to share my view on the Electoral College and the potential switch to a popular vote in presidential elections. After thorough research and consideration, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be maintained.

The Electoral College has been a key component of the United States since its establishment in 1787. It was devised by our Founding Fathers as a compromise between those advocating for Congress to elect the president and those in favor of a direct popular vote. The Electoral College guarantees that smaller states have a say in presidential elections and ensures that the president is elected with a clear majority.

Additionally, the Electoral College brings stability and predictability to presidential elections. It prevents a candidate from winning the presidency solely by securing a few highly populated cities or states. Instead, the candidate must garner support from a diverse range of voters across the nation to win the Electoral College. This helps ensure that the president has the backing of a varied group of voters and is not reliant on specific regions or demographics.

Moreover, the Electoral College has proven to be an effective system for electing presidents. Throughout over 200 years of presidential elections, there have been only a few instances where the popular vote winner did not secure the Electoral College. These occurrences have been rare and have not significantly impacted the election outcome.

While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and does not accurately represent the people's will, advocating for a popular vote as a more democratic alternative, I believe that the advantages of the Electoral College outweigh these concerns.

In conclusion, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College in presidential elections. The Electoral College has been a crucial part of our democracy for centuries, ensuring that the president is elected with a clear majority and broad voter support. While the popular vote may appear more democratic, it has its drawbacks and could lead to unintended consequences. Let us continue to uphold the Electoral College and ensure that every vote carries weight in presidential elections.

Sincerely,

It's important to challenge ourselves and push beyond our comfort zones in order to grow and achieve our goals.",1
523,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to advocate for replacing the Electoral College system with a popular vote to elect the president. While the Electoral College was intended to give smaller states more influence, I believe that the popular vote method is more democratic and in line with our nation's values.

One argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to campaign in more states. However, research shows that candidates mainly focus on swing states, leaving voters in noncompetitive states feeling neglected. A popular vote system would compel candidates to appeal to a wider range of Americans across all states.

It is also argued that the Electoral College maintains the federal nature of our elections. Yet, the winner-take-all system in most states can lead to the national popular vote winner losing the Electoral College, resulting in controversial outcomes where the president does not have the majority support. A direct popular election would ensure the president always has the backing of more citizens.

A counterargument is that smaller states may lose influence without the Electoral College. However, each citizen's vote would carry equal weight in a national popular vote, regardless of their state. Candidates would still have an incentive to build diverse coalitions rather than focusing solely on densely populated areas. A popular vote could also boost voter turnout as more votes directly impact the outcome.

In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe a national popular vote is a fairer system that better reflects democratic principles of equality and majority rule. It would promote greater political engagement. Therefore, I urge you to consider implementing a popular vote for electing the president. Thank you for taking my views into account on this important matter.",1
524,". Winston Churchill, a well-known British Prime Minister, famously stated that success involves moving from one failure to another without losing enthusiasm. This quote emphasizes the importance of resilience and determination in achieving success. In this essay, I will examine the significance of this statement and provide examples from Churchill's life that demonstrate this principle.

Churchill's statement suggests that success is not just about accomplishments, but also about the ability to persevere through challenges and setbacks. Enthusiasm, in this context, refers to maintaining a positive attitude and continuing to work towards goals even when faced with difficulties. By combining these two elements, Churchill implies that true success comes from staying positive and persistent in pursuing one's objectives, even when they seem unattainable.

One instance where Churchill exemplified this principle was during his early political career. Despite facing multiple failures, such as losing elections and being removed from leadership roles, Churchill remained dedicated to his beliefs and continued to pursue his goals with unwavering enthusiasm. This persistence eventually paid off, leading him to become one of Britain's most successful and influential leaders.

Another example of Churchill's resilience can be observed during World War II. As Britain's leader during a challenging period, Churchill encountered immense pressure and criticism. Nevertheless, he remained resolute in his determination to guide Britain through the war and achieve victory. His unwavering enthusiasm and commitment inspired the British people and boosted morale during a time of hardship.

In conclusion, Winston Churchill's quote underscores the significance of resilience and determination in attaining success. By maintaining a positive mindset and persisting in the face of adversity, individuals can overcome obstacles and realize their aspirations. Churchill's life serves as a testament to the power of this principle, continuing to motivate people worldwide.",1

I am writing to share my views on whether to keep the Electoral College or switch to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States. After reviewing various sources, I believe it is best for our country to maintain the Electoral College system. While both systems have their merits, the Electoral College offers several important advantages.

One key reason to keep the Electoral College is the certainty it provides in election outcomes. The system ensures a clear winner, reducing the likelihood of prolonged legal disputes. In contrast, a popular vote system could result in close elections without a decisive outcome, potentially leading to costly runoff elections.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the President represents a diverse range of interests and appeals to voters from different regions. This requirement for transregional appeal prevents candidates from focusing solely on densely populated areas and neglecting the needs of other regions, promoting a more balanced representation.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states and address their concerns. This leads to a more engaged electorate and prevents candidates from prioritizing the interests of heavily democratic or republican states.

The system also provides fair representation for smaller states by ensuring they are not overshadowed by larger ones. This balance of power prevents large states from dominating the election process and guarantees a more equal distribution of attention and resources from candidates.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, ensuring a prompt and clear winner.

In conclusion, while both systems have their merits, the Electoral College offers important benefits that should be considered. It ensures a decisive outcome, promotes broader representation, encourages candidates to address the concerns of swing states, safeguards the interests of smaller states, and avoids the need for runoff elections. I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College for the benefit of our nation.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue. I trust that you will carefully weigh all arguments before making a decision that will impact our electoral system.

528,"Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to share my thoughts on whether to keep the Electoral College or switch to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States. After reviewing various perspectives on this issue, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College is the best option. While there are valid concerns raised by supporters of a popular vote, the Electoral College has proven to be a necessary compromise that ensures fair representation for all states and regions in presidential elections.

One key advantage of the Electoral College is the certainty it provides in determining the outcome of the election. Judge Richard A. Bonner explains that the winning candidate's share of electoral votes typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the results. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes also allows for a clear victor without the need for runoff elections.

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes unity and broad support from multiple regions, rather than focusing solely on one area. This ensures that the president represents the entire country and not just a specific region. By requiring candidates to have transregional appeal, the Electoral College helps prevent feelings of disenfranchisement among residents of different regions.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, leading to greater engagement and informed voters in those areas. This system gives swing states a significant role in the election process, empowering their voters to play a key part in choosing the president.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of large and small states in the political process. Large states receive more attention from candidates during campaigns, but the apportionment of the Senate ensures that both large and small states have a say in the electoral process.

While there are valid criticisms of the Electoral College, such as candidates focusing only on swing states and some voters feeling marginalized, the benefits of the system outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College provides certainty, ensures national representation, encourages engagement with different regions, and maintains a balance between states of varying sizes.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial aspect of our democracy that should be preserved. Its practical advantages allow for a fair and effective election process that represents the diverse interests of our nation. I urge you to consider these points when making decisions regarding the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this issue.

535,"Dear Printable,

I don't believe it's a good idea to implement a rule that requires a B average to participate in sports or other activities. I understand that you are trying to help us improve our skills, but I don't think this is the right approach.

To begin with, not all of us excel in academics because we have other important commitments. Some of us may need to work to support our families or have a passion for music or art. Just because we struggle in math or English doesn't mean we lack intelligence or talent in other areas.

Furthermore, such a rule would exclude many students from participating in activities they love. For example, a student may be exceptional at basketball or enjoy being in the school play. If they are unable to participate due to their grades, it would be unjust.

Lastly, this rule could negatively impact students' self-esteem. It's already challenging to feel like you fit in at school, and being unable to do the things you enjoy could worsen those feelings.

I believe it would be more beneficial to explore alternative solutions. Perhaps we could have a discussion with our teachers to find a way to improve our skills without sacrificing the activities we are passionate about.

537,"In today's fast-paced world, students often have many responsibilities outside of school, making it challenging for them to attend classes regularly. As a result, many students are turning to online learning to balance their academic and personal lives. In this essay, I will argue that students should have the option to attend classes from home, as it provides various advantages for both students and schools.

To begin with, learning from home can help students manage their responsibilities outside of school. For instance, some students may have young children or elderly family members to care for, making it hard to balance schoolwork with caregiving duties. By attending classes from home, students can create a schedule that suits them, enabling them to focus on their studies at designated times while still being available to care for their loved ones.

Moreover, studying from home can offer students a more comfortable and secure learning environment. Some students may struggle with anxiety or feel uneasy in a classroom setting, hindering their ability to concentrate on their studies. By learning from home, students can customize their space to meet their needs, helping them feel more at ease and focused on their education.

Furthermore, attending classes from home can lead to better academic outcomes. When students can concentrate on their studies and establish a schedule that works for them, they are more likely to excel academically. Additionally, online learning platforms provide a range of interactive tools and resources that can keep students engaged and motivated.

In conclusion, I believe that students should have the opportunity to attend classes from home.

543,"Dear Principal,

I am writing to discuss the idea of making community service mandatory for all students. On one hand, requiring community service can have positive effects. It teaches students the importance of giving back to their community and helping those in need. Engaging in activities such as tutoring younger students or participating in neighborhood cleanup projects can help students develop empathy, leadership skills, and a greater appreciation for what they have. It also demonstrates to potential employers or colleges that students are engaged and civic-minded individuals.

However, there are also drawbacks to mandating community service. Not all students have the free time to volunteer outside of school due to jobs, family responsibilities, or other commitments. Forcing students to volunteer may take away from the spirit of service and turn it into a mandatory task. Students who are not interested may not fully benefit from the experience if they feel like they are just fulfilling a requirement. Additionally, for some students, the financial burden of providing their own transportation to service sites may be too much.

In conclusion, while I believe community service is valuable, I do not think it should be required for all students. A better approach would be to strongly encourage volunteerism through an optional program with incentives. This would allow students to choose to participate if their schedules allow, without penalizing those who are unable to commit the time. It is important to recognize and respect the various circumstances of students. A mandatory policy may end up alienating those it is meant to help. Therefore, I do not recommend making community service a universal requirement.",1
544,"People should have the freedom to express themselves and live as they choose, regardless of societal norms or expectations. Each person has their own unique beliefs, backgrounds, and experiences that shape who they are and how they see the world. Suppressing these differences not only harms individual identity but can also lead to feelings of frustration, insecurity, and depression.

When individuals are allowed to express themselves, it enables them to share their thoughts, ideas, and emotions freely. This fosters understanding and respect for diversity and promotes a more inclusive society. By embracing and celebrating these differences, we can create a more diverse and fair world.

Furthermore, allowing people to express themselves empowers them to take pride in their individuality and autonomy. This encourages self-acceptance and confidence, leading to greater self-esteem and a stronger sense of identity. In a society that often values conformity over uniqueness, it is crucial to acknowledge the importance of allowing individuals to be true to themselves and express their true selves.

By promoting self-expression and freedom, we can create a positive and accepting environment for all individuals. It is essential to recognize and respect the diversity of individuals and encourage them to embrace their differences.

In contrast, older individuals may have already settled into their careers and lifestyles, leading to a sense of routine and potentially diminishing excitement. Additionally, young people are typically less burdened by the responsibilities and stresses of life, such as financial concerns, family obligations, and work pressures, allowing them to fully embrace and appreciate their time and have more fun. On the whole, the enjoyment of life among young people can be attributed to their ongoing exploration of the world and the lesser amount of stress in their lives.",1
546,"Self discovery is a challenging journey that many embark on but few fully embrace. It requires courage, vulnerability, and a willingness to confront one's flaws and insecurities. However, the benefits of self discovery are invaluable, as it enables us to be authentic and live life on our own terms.

One of the main obstacles to self discovery is the pressure to conform to societal norms. We are bombarded with messages dictating how we should look, dress, and think, making it easy to lose sight of our unique identity. Embracing our individuality is crucial for happiness and fulfillment, as we all have different traits and experiences that shape who we are.

While it's natural to have role models for inspiration, trying to emulate them can lead to disappointment. Each person is unique, with their own strengths and weaknesses. Instead of trying to fit in, we should celebrate our differences and accept ourselves as we are. This includes acknowledging our flaws and accomplishments, and surrounding ourselves with supportive people.

Comedian Liza Josh is a prime example of someone who has embraced their individuality and achieved success by staying true to themselves. Her unapologetic humor and authenticity have resonated with audiences, highlighting the power of being genuine.

547,"Dear [State Senator],

I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College system, which I believe is a fairer and more representative way of determining the President than a direct popular vote. The winner-takes-all system in each state ensures that all voices are heard, not just those from swing states.

One key benefit of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides, as the number of electoral votes is fixed and typically results in a clear winner. This reduces the likelihood of disputes over election results, as seen in the 2000 presidential race.

While opponents argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic because a candidate can win without the popular vote, I believe it better reflects the will of the people by considering both personal preferences and elector trust.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to have broad appeal across regions, as they must win states with diverse interests. This prevents the President from being elected by a specific region or demographic.

Additionally, the system incentivizes candidates to campaign in all states, not just swing states, and gives large states like California and Texas appropriate weight in the political process.

Lastly, the Electoral College ensures a clear winner in elections where no candidate receives a majority of votes.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the benefits of the Electoral College system when evaluating any potential changes. It is a fair, representative, and certain way of electing the President.

Sincerely,

552,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my strong support for eliminating the Electoral College and instead electing the President of the United States through a popular vote.

The Electoral College was established in the late 18th century when the United States was much smaller to ensure that smaller states had a voice in the presidential election. However, it is no longer necessary or fair.

In recent elections, there have been instances where the candidate who won the popular vote did not win the election, which disenfranchises the majority of voters. It also allows a candidate to become president without support from large parts of the country.

The Electoral College also leads candidates to focus on a small number of swing states, neglecting the needs of voters in other states who feel their votes do not matter.

Therefore, I believe the Electoral College should be abolished in favor of electing the President through a popular vote to accurately reflect the will of the majority of voters.

Subject: Importance of Electoral College in Preserving Democracy

Dear [State Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College plays a crucial role in ensuring fair representation and stability in our democratic system. While some advocate for a direct popular vote, I believe the Electoral College helps prevent chaos and preserves the will of the people.

One key advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty in election outcomes. The winner-take-all system in most states ensures a clear victory and reduces the likelihood of disputes. Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country has a voice in the election, preventing a concentration of power in specific areas.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the outcome is uncertain. This ensures that candidates address a diverse range of voter concerns and fosters a more informed electorate. The Electoral College also provides a balance between small and large states, preventing the political balance from tilting heavily in favor of larger states.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a vital safeguard that upholds fairness, representation, and stability in our democracy. I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College to maintain the integrity of our elections and uphold democratic values.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your dedication to serving our state and nation.

560,"I do not agree that the concept of learning for the sake of learning is outdated. While education should have a purpose, it should not be restricted to a predetermined goal. Learning for its own sake should be the foundation of any educational system, as it equips students with a broad knowledge base that can be useful in the future.

One of the main benefits of learning for its own sake is that it promotes intellectual growth. By allowing students to explore new ideas and think critically, it helps them develop a broader understanding of various subjects. This knowledge can help them adapt to different situations and make informed decisions. Additionally, it allows students to pursue personal interests and passions.

Some may argue that learning without a clear goal is not worthwhile. However, the focus should be on how the learning process will benefit the individual in the long term, rather than the immediate outcome. While students may not be able to apply their knowledge to a specific job right away, they will gain a deeper understanding of the subject that can be valuable for future endeavors.

561,"Title: The Face on Mars: A Geological Formation

Introduction:
The Face on Mars has long captured the interest of many, with some speculating it to be a sign of alien life. However, as a NASA scientist, I argue that the Face is not of extraterrestrial origin but rather a natural geological structure. In this essay, I will use evidence from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" to support my argument and disprove the alien theory.

Arguments in Support of the Natural Formation Theory:

1. The Face is not unique: The article reveals that the Face is just one of many mesas in the Cydonia region, similar to Earth's buttes or mesas. This suggests that the Face is a natural part of the Martian landscape, not a special creation.
2. Geological features match natural formations: Data from the Mars Global Surveyor show that the Face and other mesas in Cydonia have geological features consistent with natural formations, such as erosion and tectonic activity. This supports the idea that the Face is a natural structure, not man-made.
3. Location is significant: The Face is situated at a potential ancient Martian ocean boundary, indicating that it was formed by natural geological processes. Understanding Mars' history is crucial in determining the origins of its geological features, and the location of the Face supports the natural formation theory.

Evidence from the Article Supporting the Natural Formation Theory:

1. Mars Global Surveyor images: High-resolution images from the Mars Global Surveyor in 1997 revealed the Face to be a natural landform, similar to other mesas in Cydonia.
2. Laser altimetry data: Data from the Mars Global Surveyor confirmed that the Face and other mesas in Cydonia have geological features consistent with natural formations on Earth.
3. Geological context: The article emphasizes the geological context of the Face, located at a potential ancient Martian ocean boundary, suggesting natural geological processes were responsible for its formation.

Conclusion:
The Face on Mars is not a creation of aliens but a natural geological structure. Evidence from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" supports this argument, including the Face's lack of uniqueness, geological features matching natural formations, and its location at a potential ancient Martian ocean boundary. Understanding the natural processes that formed the Face is essential in uncovering Mars' past, and further exploration may reveal more about our neighboring planet.",1
562,"Although the concept of extraterrestrial involvement in the creation of the ""Face on Mars"" is intriguing, the evidence clearly indicates that it is a natural landform. As a NASA scientist who has studied this feature, I can explain why the ""Face"" is undoubtedly of natural origin. One of the main arguments supporting this conclusion is the absence of any artificial materials found in the formation. Various imaging technologies, such as NASA's Mars Global Surveyor, have allowed scientists to closely examine the ""Face"" and have revealed that it is made up of the same rocks and soils as the surrounding terrain. If aliens had created this structure, we would expect to find materials not typically found on Mars, but there is no evidence of any unusual chemical or mineral compositions. Another key point is that the erosion patterns on the ""Face"" match those of nearby rock formations, indicating that natural weathering processes over millions of years have shaped the feature. The article also discusses how sediment layers and erosion patterns on the ""Face"" align precisely with geological features in the region, ruling out the possibility of intentional carving by an advanced civilization. In conclusion, while the idea of aliens on Mars may be captivating, scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports the notion that the ""Face on Mars"" is simply a naturally occurring geological formation. Its resemblance to a human face is purely coincidental and the result of natural processes over time. As scientists, we must rely on evidence rather than personal beliefs, and in this case, the evidence clearly shows that the ""Face"" was formed by nature, not aliens. The mystery has been solved through objective analysis, rather than sensational claims lacking factual basis.",1

567,"I will discuss how people's initial perceptions of others can evolve over time. It is common for us to quickly form opinions about someone, but these opinions can shift as we become more familiar with them.

One reason for this change is our tendency to judge based on superficial factors like appearance or clothing. For example, if someone dresses uniquely, we may initially view them as strange, but later discover they are actually interesting and funny, altering our initial impression.

Another factor that can influence a shift in perception is learning more about someone's personality and interests. If someone appears reserved at first but we later learn they have a passion for music or art, our opinion of them can completely change, leading to a potential friendship.

Additionally, our first impression of someone can be altered by their actions after we have already formed an opinion. For instance, if someone performs a kind gesture like helping with homework or defending us in front of others, our view of them can shift from negative to positive.

Ultimately, gaining a deeper understanding of someone can result in a different perspective than our initial impression.

576,"Dear Principal,

I think that community service is a valuable experience for students, but I do not believe it should be mandatory for all students.

On one hand, community service can help students develop important skills like empathy, responsibility, and teamwork. For example, my friend who tutors elementary school children has learned patience and understanding while helping her students. Additionally, community service can help students understand the importance of giving back to their community. My friend who cleans up litter has seen the impact a small group of people can have on the environment.

However, requiring all students to participate in community service may take away from time needed for other important activities. Some students have family responsibilities, extracurricular activities, or part-time jobs that already occupy much of their time. Adding community service on top of that could be overwhelming.

I believe it is important to encourage students to engage in community service, but not to make it mandatory. Instead, the school could offer opportunities for students to participate in community service projects and acknowledge those who choose to participate. This way, students who are interested in community service can still benefit from the experience, while those with other commitments can focus on their responsibilities.

In conclusion, while I see the benefits of community service for students, I do not think it should be a requirement for all. I recommend providing opportunities for students to engage in community service and recognizing those who do, rather than making it compulsory.

578,"Have you ever thought about how many enjoyable activities are available outside of your usual routine? There are countless options waiting to be explored, whether you prefer spending time with loved ones or going solo. In this essay, we will discuss three reasons why it's important to step outside your comfort zone and try new things.

The first reason to step outside your comfort zone is to experience something different. Trying a new restaurant or engaging in a new sport can be a great way to challenge yourself and discover new interests. For instance, if you've never attempted rock climbing, why not give it a shot? It not only provides a good workout but also offers an exciting challenge.

The second reason to step outside your comfort zone is to broaden your horizons. Exploring a new city or sampling a different cuisine can expand your knowledge and cultural understanding. For example, if you've never visited Paris, why not plan a trip to explore its iconic landmarks and attractions?

The third reason to step outside your comfort zone is to fulfill a long-held desire. Whether it's skydiving or scuba diving, trying something you've always wanted to do can be a fulfilling experience. If you've dreamt of skydiving, why not take the leap and feel the exhilaration of free fall?

In conclusion, stepping outside your comfort zone can lead to personal growth, new experiences, and a sense of fulfillment. Whether you're trying something new, exploring uncharted territory, or pursuing a lifelong dream, taking a chance can lead to fun and relaxation.

581,"Hello! So, you know how there's been a lot of talk about the potential benefits and drawbacks of a four day school week for students, businesses, and the environment? I'm not entirely sure if it would be a positive change, but it's definitely something worth considering.

Let's start with the advantages for businesses. If schools were only open four days a week, it could lead to significant savings on utilities and transportation costs. Just think about how much money schools could save on electricity and water by closing for an extra day, and how much businesses could save on transportation if students weren't commuting every day.

However, there are also potential downsides for businesses to consider. For example, what if students aren't getting enough learning time? Some may argue that they can catch up on weekends, but weekends are important for relaxation and personal interests. If students are spending their weekends doing homework and studying, it could lead to increased stress.

Now, let's discuss the impact on students. A four day school week could be incredibly beneficial for kids. Having an extra day to pursue passions and interests could be amazing. Imagine being able to learn a new skill or participate in more extracurricular activities without the pressure of homework hanging over you.",1
582,"I think it is important for students to have the opportunity to design their own summer projects rather than having them assigned by teachers. This allows students to choose topics they are passionate about, making the learning process more engaging and enjoyable. For instance, if a student is interested in photography, they could explore the history of photography or study famous photographers, leading to a more invested and successful project.

In contrast, being assigned a project on a topic that does not interest us can make the project feel like a chore and limit our learning potential. By allowing students to choose their own projects, they can develop their creativity, research skills, and organizational abilities. For example, creating a photography project would require coming up with innovative ways to present information, conducting research, and organizing findings effectively, all of which are valuable skills for future projects.

In summary, I believe that student-designed summer projects are beneficial as they enhance engagement, foster creativity, and teach important skills.",1

I am writing to share my views on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. While some argue that it is outdated and unfair, I believe it is an essential part of our democratic process. Here are five reasons why I believe the Electoral College should be maintained or changed to a direct popular vote:

1. The Electoral College provides a clear and decisive outcome to presidential elections, reducing the likelihood of disputes and recounts compared to a popular vote system.
2. The Electoral College requires presidential candidates to have broad appeal across regions, preventing any one region from having too much influence in electing a president.
3. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus on swing states, leading to more engaged and thoughtful voting in those states.
4. The Electoral College balances the political power of large states due to the apportionment of the Senate, giving more weight to victories in larger states.
5. The Electoral College helps avoid the need for runoff elections by providing a clear winner in the initial election process.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.

2. The concept of car-free cities is gaining popularity due to concerns about traffic congestion, air pollution, and climate change.
3. Successful examples of car-free cities include Copenhagen, Amsterdam, and Bogota.

In Copenhagen, Denmark, the city has made significant investments in bicycle infrastructure and encouraged cycling as the main mode of transportation. This has led to over half of daily commutes being done by bike, resulting in reduced air pollution and increased green spaces.

Amsterdam, Netherlands, implemented a car-free policy in 2008, banning cars from the city center during the day. This has reduced traffic congestion and improved air quality, with a strong emphasis on biking as a cultural norm.

Bogota, Colombia, has focused on a centralized transportation system with bus rapid transit lines and measures to discourage car usage. This has successfully reduced traffic congestion and air pollution, particularly benefiting low-income residents.

Car-free cities are popular for their ability to reduce traffic and air pollution, improve public health, and bring economic benefits by attracting businesses and reducing costs associated with parking and traffic management. However, challenges include the need for a comprehensive public transportation system to support the transition.",1
586,"As an 8th grader, I believe that technology has completely transformed the way we communicate and interact with others. It's astonishing to see how many individuals are constantly glued to their phones, unable to put them down even for a moment. This reliance on technology extends beyond just social media, encompassing messaging apps, video calls, and even studying. It's perplexing how some individuals manage to find time for anything else.

However, there are positive aspects to technology as well. It has significantly simplified communication with individuals who are far away. For instance, my best friend moved to a different state last year, yet we are able to talk daily on FaceTime, enabling us to see each other despite the distance. This connectivity is not limited to friends; families can also stay in touch through platforms like WhatsApp. Technology serves as a perfect tool for maintaining relationships across distances.

On the flip side, there are drawbacks to technology. Many individuals are so engrossed in their phones that they fail to pay attention to their surroundings, leading to accidents. Additionally, online interactions can turn toxic, with cyberbullying becoming a prevalent issue. It's disheartening to witness the lack of kindness in online interactions.

Education plays a crucial role in understanding and utilizing technology effectively. My teacher from last year taught us how to navigate computers and the internet, which proved to be immensely beneficial. However, not everyone has access to technology, depriving them of valuable opportunities.

I am writing to express my support for eliminating the Electoral College and instead electing the President of the United States through a popular vote. I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated system that no longer accurately represents the American people.

The Electoral College was established in the 18th century when the United States was very different from what it is today. Back then, communication and travel were slow and difficult, so having electors from each state gather to cast their votes for President made sense. However, in today's world where communication and travel are much easier, there is no longer a need for a system where a small group of electors can determine the election outcome.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system is unjust. In a popular vote election, every person's vote would hold the same weight. However, in the Electoral College system, some votes carry more significance than others. For instance, in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by over 3 million votes, but Donald Trump secured the presidency because he won more electoral votes. This discrepancy is due to the Electoral College giving more importance to votes from smaller states.

Additionally, the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to concentrate their efforts on a handful of swing states where the election outcome is uncertain. This results in candidates spending a disproportionate amount of time and resources in these states while neglecting the rest of the country. This is unfair to residents of states that are not considered swing states.

I firmly believe that the most equitable way to elect the President of the United States is through a popular vote. This system would ensure that every American has a voice in the election process. I urge you to support the abolition of the Electoral College in favor of a popular vote system.

I am writing to discuss why students require a lengthier summer vacation and the advantages associated with having an extended break. In my opinion, students spend too much time in school and need more time to unwind and rejuvenate during the summer months.

To begin with, students need a break from the demands of school. The school year can be very challenging, with students attending classes for long hours, completing homework, and participating in extracurricular activities. A longer summer break allows students to take a break from these responsibilities and engage in other activities they may not have time for during the school year.

Furthermore, a longer summer break gives students the chance to catch up on any academic work they may have fallen behind on. This is especially important for students who are struggling academically, as they can use the extra time to study and improve their grades.

Additionally, a longer summer break enables students to participate in activities that promote physical and mental well-being. For instance, students can engage in sports, outdoor trips, or hobbies that they may not have time for during the school year. These activities can help students reduce stress and enhance their overall health.

It is worth noting that taking extended breaks during other seasons, such as fall, winter, or spring, could lead to potential issues. For example, students may miss important academic deadlines or fall behind on coursework if they take too much time off during these seasons. Moreover, students may struggle to adjust to the new school year if they have an extended break during the summer months.

In conclusion, I believe that students require a longer summer break to relax and recharge from the demands of the school year. The benefits of a longer summer break include the opportunity to catch up on academic work, engage in activities that promote physical and mental health, and reduce stress. While extended breaks during other seasons may have drawbacks, the advantages of a longer summer break outweigh any potential issues.

606," Can cities become carefree in their urban planning for the future?

Cities around the world are currently facing a major challenge: air pollution. As populations grow and transportation options expand, the amount of pollutants being emitted into the atmosphere also increases. In response to this issue, some cities have started to experiment with the concept of carefree living. Places like German suburbs, Paris, and Bogotá have implemented either partial or full car bans in an effort to reduce smog. While these initiatives have had varying levels of success, they do raise an important question: could limiting car usage be the key to a healthier and more sustainable future?

Advocates for carefree cities argue that reducing car usage could have a significant positive impact on air quality. Studies have shown that cars are a major source of air pollution, emitting harmful pollutants like particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. By limiting the use of cars, these pollutants can be greatly reduced, leading to improved air quality and public health. Additionally, carefree cities promote alternative transportation methods such as biking, walking, and public transit, which are generally more environmentally friendly than cars.

On the other hand, some believe that limiting car usage is not feasible and could have negative effects on the economy. The automotive industry plays a significant role in the global economy, and restricting car usage could potentially result in job losses and economic instability. Additionally, relying solely on public transit and alternative transportation methods may be inconvenient and time-consuming, especially in areas with limited public transportation options.

I am writing to discuss the school's reconsideration of the cell phone policy options. I believe that Policy 1, which allows students to bring phones to school but requires them to be turned off during class time, is the better choice for our school. Here are a few reasons why:

Firstly, allowing phones during lunch and free periods recognizes that cell phones are an important part of students' lives. For many students, their phones are how they communicate with friends and family outside of school hours. Banning phones completely could negatively impact students' social lives and responsibilities. Policy 1 is a reasonable compromise that still allows students to stay connected if needed during breaks.

Secondly, keeping phones turned off during class time helps students focus on their studies without distractions. Research shows that constant phone notifications can hinder attention and increase the temptation to check messages during lessons. Policy 1 provides a clear rule about phone usage to support effective learning, while still allowing students to use their devices responsibly when not in class. An outright ban may be harder to enforce and could lead to resentment.

Finally, Policy 1 prepares students for the reality of phone usage in further education and their future careers. Universities and workplaces also require focus during designated times but allow flexibility elsewhere. By introducing this balanced approach now, our students will develop important self-discipline skills for their future. Policy 2 may create unrealistic expectations about managing technology.

In conclusion, I believe Policy 1 is the best choice as it supports students' needs while prioritizing learning during class time. Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue. Please let me know if you need any further insights from students.

Additionally, seeking advice from multiple people can provide you with more information on a subject. Each person may have different knowledge or insights to offer, which can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding. For instance, if you ask your friends and brother how to make a good fist, they may offer different techniques that you can combine to create an effective fist.

Furthermore, consulting multiple individuals for advice can help prevent making a mistake. By verifying information from different sources, you can ensure that the advice you receive is accurate and reliable. For example, if you ask your teacher and friend whether jumping off a bridge is a good idea, and they both advise against it, you can confidently conclude that it is not a safe decision.

In conclusion, seeking advice from multiple people can lead to a more well-rounded decision-making process by providing diverse perspectives, additional information, and preventing potential mistakes. Next time you face a decision, consider seeking advice from multiple individuals and carefully evaluate their input.",1
610,"Title: The Benefits of Restricting Car Usage

Introduction:
Restricting car usage is a growing trend worldwide, driven by the need to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, encourage alternative transportation, and create more sustainable communities. Various case studies highlight the advantages of limiting car usage, such as the car-free district of Vauban in Germany, the driving ban in Paris, and the car-free day in Bogotá. By implementing strategic planning, reducing reliance on cars, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, cities and communities can enjoy cleaner air, reduced congestion, improved public health, and a better quality of life.

Body Paragraph 1: Decrease in Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The transportation sector, particularly passenger cars, significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Cars account for 12% of emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some areas of the United States. By limiting car usage, communities can make a substantial impact on reducing emissions and combating climate change. The example of Vauban, where 70% of families do not own cars, shows how a car-free lifestyle can greatly reduce carbon footprints.

Body Paragraph 2: Enhanced Air Quality and Public Health
Vehicle emissions are a major source of air pollution, especially in densely populated cities. The driving ban in Paris during a smog episode led to reduced congestion and improved air quality. This temporary measure resulted in a 60% decrease in congestion and highlighted the negative health effects of car usage. Limiting car usage can lead to cleaner air, lower rates of respiratory illnesses, and overall improved public health.

Body Paragraph 3: Decreased Congestion and Improved Livability
Initiatives like car-free districts and car-free days in Vauban and Bogotá demonstrate the potential for reduced congestion and improved livability. These programs create space for alternative transportation methods like walking, biking, and public transit. The car-free day in Bogotá, as reported by the Seattle Times, showcased a day without traffic jams, promoting efficient transportation and a better urban environment. Additionally, car-free districts create walkable communities with better access to amenities.

Body Paragraph 4: Economic Benefits and Diverse Transportation Options
Limiting car usage also brings economic advantages. The decline in car ownership rates before the recession indicates a cultural shift, prompting companies like Ford and Mercedes to expand their product ranges beyond personal vehicles. Embracing alternative transportation options such as car sharing and public transit can help residents save money on transportation costs, reduce the need for parking spaces, and lessen the strain on infrastructure.

Conclusion:
Restricting car usage offers numerous benefits for individuals, communities, and the environment. Case studies worldwide demonstrate the positive impact of reducing car dependency, from lower greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality to decreased congestion and enhanced livability. By implementing smart planning, promoting alternative transportation, and changing the car-centric culture, communities can create sustainable, healthy, and accessible urban environments. Embracing these changes will not only benefit individuals but also contribute to the global effort to combat climate change and create a better future.",1

Subject: Support for Maintaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my endorsement of the Electoral College system in the United States. The Electoral College, established by our founding fathers, plays a vital role in our democratic process by ensuring fair representation for all states and preventing smaller states from being marginalized in presidential elections.

One key benefit of the Electoral College is the certainty it provides in determining the election outcome. The system requires a strong electoral majority for a candidate to win the presidency, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the results.

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes the idea of a president for all Americans by requiring candidates to have broad appeal across different regions. This ensures that the president represents the interests of all citizens, regardless of where they live.

The system also encourages candidates to focus on swing states, where winning over voters can significantly impact the election outcome. This leads to a more engaged electorate and ensures a diverse range of opinions are considered in selecting the president.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the political power between large and small states, preventing larger states from dominating the electoral process and giving smaller states a voice.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections by requiring a majority of electoral votes to win the presidency, ensuring a clear winner emerges without delays or disputes.

Despite criticisms of the Electoral College, it is important to recognize the benefits it provides in representing all Americans and ensuring a fair election process. I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system to maintain the integrity of our democratic processes.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.

Sincerely,

619,"The power of first impressions should not be underestimated. From just one look, we often make assumptions about a person's character, intelligence, and trustworthiness. However, it is important to remember that these judgments can be inaccurate, and someone we initially dislike may turn out to be a valuable friend or mentor. Charisma and personality play a crucial role in changing these first impressions, as they can help overcome any negative perceptions. Charisma can be developed through gestures and body language, while personality can be improved with practice.

621,"As an eighth grade student, I believe that we have the ability to select our own character traits. While this may seem like a bold statement, I am of the opinion that our actions and behaviors stem from the decisions we make. In this essay, I will explore the idea of whether we can consciously choose traits such as being reserved, sociable, and self-assured.

To begin with, being quiet is a characteristic that some individuals naturally possess. While some may be naturally shy and prefer solitude, others may be reserved due to past experiences or cultural influences. Nevertheless, I believe that we have the power to decide whether we want to be quiet or not. For instance, if someone feels uncomfortable in social situations, they may choose to remain silent to avoid any potential awkwardness. Conversely, if someone wishes to voice their thoughts and opinions, they can choose to speak up.

Similarly, being social is another trait that we can choose to adopt. While some people thrive in social settings and enjoy the company of others, others may be more introverted and prefer solitude. However, I believe that we can make a conscious decision to be social or not. For example, if someone desires to expand their social circle or make new friends, they can choose to be more outgoing and participate in social activities. On the other hand, if someone prefers to focus on their own interests and hobbies, they may choose to be more introverted and spend time alone.

Lastly, being confident in oneself is a trait that many struggle with. Some individuals may be overly critical of themselves or have a negative self-image, while others may exude confidence and self-assurance. Nonetheless, I believe that we have the ability to choose whether we want to be confident in ourselves or not. For instance, if someone wishes to boost their self-esteem and confidence, they can choose to focus on their strengths and accomplishments. Conversely, if someone desires to be more humble and grounded, they can choose to let go of their ego and focus on helping others.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that we hold the power to select our own character traits. Whether it is being reserved, sociable, or self-assured, our actions and behaviors are a reflection of the choices we make. By being mindful of our thoughts and emotions, we can choose to cultivate traits that will lead us to a fulfilling and content life.",1
622,"In my opinion, stricter gun control laws are essential to safeguard individuals from the dangers posed by firearms. The presence of firearms heightens the risk of unrelated violence, as evidenced by the high number of firearm-related deaths in the United States compared to countries with stricter gun control laws like Japan. Additionally, mass shootings are on the rise in nations with lenient gun regulations, leading to devastating consequences for communities. Implementing stricter gun control measures would make it harder for unauthorized individuals to access firearms, thereby reducing the occurrence of such tragedies.

Moreover, stringent gun control laws would also help lower the rate of suicides by firearm, as demonstrated by studies showing a correlation between stricter gun laws and decreased suicide rates. Furthermore, children are often victims of gun violence, whether through accidental shootings or intentional acts. By enforcing stricter gun control laws, we can prevent children from being exposed to firearms, ultimately reducing the number of deaths and injuries among them.

In conclusion, stricter gun control laws are imperative to protect individuals from the dangers associated with firearms. The availability of firearms increases the likelihood of unrelated violence, mass shootings, suicides by firearm, and gun violence against children. By enacting stricter gun control laws, we can mitigate these risks and create safer communities for all.",1
623,"The arts, such as music, dance, and visual arts, are essential parts of a student's education and should be prioritized in school curriculums alongside subjects like math and science. Just like any other subject, the arts offer students a variety of skills and knowledge that can help them grow and succeed. Students should be encouraged to explore and nurture their artistic abilities in order to become more well-rounded and educated individuals.

One of the main benefits of the arts is that they allow students to express their creativity and emotions. Learning to play an instrument or create art can give students a platform to share their thoughts, feelings, and unique perspectives. This creative outlet can bring joy and confidence to students, helping them develop their own voice and outlook on the world.

Furthermore, engaging in the arts can enhance students' problem-solving and critical thinking skills. In art classes, students are challenged to think outside the box, find innovative solutions, and approach projects from different angles. These skills can be applied to other subjects and real-life situations, fostering a more well-rounded and adaptable mindset.

The arts also promote social and communication skills, as students often collaborate and communicate with peers in artistic endeavors. Working together in music or art classes can teach students how to trust others, share ideas, and effectively convey their thoughts. These interpersonal skills are valuable for building strong relationships and working effectively in teams.

Lastly, the arts can boost students' confidence and sense of achievement. Mastering a musical piece or completing a painting can instill a sense of pride and accomplishment in students, boosting their self-esteem and motivation. This newfound confidence can spill over into other areas of their lives, empowering them to tackle challenges with resilience and determination.

In summary, the arts play a crucial role in education and should be given equal importance to traditional subjects. By embracing the arts, students can develop essential skills, express their creativity, and build confidence, ultimately shaping them into well-rounded individuals.",1

Have you heard about the idea of schools possibly having a foundry work week? It may sound strange, but I believe it could be interesting. With more time to spend with friends, pursue hobbies, and relax, it could be beneficial. However, there are both advantages and disadvantages to consider.

On the positive side, having a foundry work week would allow students to have more free time outside of school. This could mean more time for activities like playing video games, watching YouTube, and helping with household chores. Additionally, having an extra day off to rest and unwind could be enjoyable.

Yet, there are also drawbacks to this idea. Teachers and staff may not be pleased with the longer hours they would have to work on school days. Concerns about the impact on academic performance may arise, as less time in school could potentially lead to decreased learning. Furthermore, the financial implications of implementing a foundry work week, such as reduced funding for school supplies, must be considered.

In conclusion, while a foundry work week in schools could have its benefits, it is important to carefully weigh the pros and cons to ensure it is a positive change for everyone involved. It is crucial to avoid causing stress for teachers and staff, as well as ensuring that students continue to receive a quality education. Ultimately, this decision should be made thoughtfully.",1

627,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for changing our current electoral system to a popular vote for electing the President of the United States. While the Electoral College was originally intended to give smaller states more influence, I believe it no longer serves that purpose and has several disadvantages.

One argument in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in more states. However, research shows that in recent elections, candidates have focused their efforts on a few swing states, ignoring the majority of states. This disproportionately affects campaign strategies and issues discussed. A popular vote system may encourage candidates to campaign nationwide and consider the interests of all citizens, not just swing state voters.

It is also argued that without the Electoral College, candidates in large states like California and Texas would ignore the interests of smaller states. However, evidence suggests that a popular vote would not necessarily diminish the influence of smaller states. Candidates would still aim to attract voters from across the nation, regardless of population size, as every vote could help them win the presidency. The current system where some states are ignored is a disadvantage to both small and large states.

Most importantly, the Electoral College has led to multiple elections where the candidate with the most individual votes nationwide did not become President. This goes against the principle of one person, one vote that is central to our democratic system. While no system is perfect, a popular vote would better reflect the will of the people by ensuring that the candidate supported by the largest number of Americans wins the presidency.

For these reasons, I believe changing to a popular vote system is more fair and democratic than sticking with the current Electoral College method. I hope you will consider supporting efforts to implement this reform. The presidency should be determined solely by whom candidates can persuade the most citizens to vote for across the country.

Thank you for your time and consideration. Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Sincerely,

On one hand, cell phones can be a distraction in class as students may use them to text, play games, or browse social media instead of focusing on the lesson. This can disrupt the learning process and divert attention away from the teacher. Additionally, cell phones can be a source of distraction for other students who may be tempted to use their phones instead of participating in the lesson.

On the other hand, cell phones can be a valuable tool for students. For instance, they can be used to access educational resources and information, allowing students to research topics, find specific information, or even collaborate with classmates on projects. Furthermore, cell phones can enhance the learning experience by enabling teachers to create interactive lessons, virtual field trips, and simulations that engage students and make learning more enjoyable.

635,"While summer projects are important for continued learning, students benefit the most when they have a say in their own projects. Student-designed summer work allows for more creativity, choice, and engagement compared to teacher-designed assignments. When students have the autonomy to choose their summer learning, they are more invested in the work. They can select topics that genuinely interest them, leading to added learning as they explore their passions. Crafting their own projects also helps foster independence, problem-solving skills, and responsibility as students effectively plan and manage their time.

Student-led projects often blend learning with fun and tap into their natural curiosity. They may investigate topics through hands-on experimentation, real-world applications, or interactive experiences like interviews. This makes the work feel less like a chore and more like an enriching summer activity. For example, a student interested in art history could visit local museums and galleries instead of just reading about famous paintings.

However, there is a risk of some students slacking off or choosing inappropriate topics without guidelines in place. Therefore, it is important to have guidelines such as aligning projects with curriculum standards and getting approval from teachers or parents. Nevertheless, the focus should be on student ownership with support from advisors, rather than one-size-fits-all tasks handed down from above. When given appropriate parameters and autonomy, many students rise to the challenge of advising their own summer learning experiences.

In conclusion, while schools implement various methods to continue students' education over breaks, the most effective approach empowers young people as partners in the learning process. Student-designed summer projects foster increased engagement, creativity, and responsibility compared to standard teacher assignments. With proper guidance, this approach offers an ideal balance of accountability and student ownership over their education.",1

If we give up on something we want, we are showing that we are not willing to put in the effort to achieve our goals. However, if we keep pushing through, even when it's tough, we show that we are committed to reaching our dreams.

Lastly, not giving up increases our chances of success. If we quit, we will never know if we could have achieved our goals with more effort. But by persevering, even when it's challenging, we are more likely to accomplish what we set out to do.

647,"In Chinese culture, it is a common practice to withhold the truth from cancer patients, a tradition that has been in place for many years. However, with modernization, there is now a debate over whether this practice should be changed. In my opinion, it is necessary to inform cancer patients of their condition.

The main reason for disclosing the truth to cancer patients is to ensure they receive the appropriate medical care. Without knowing the truth, patients may not receive the necessary treatment. For instance, if a patient is unaware of the seriousness of their condition, they may refuse beneficial treatments like surgery. Additionally, not informing the patient can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment, which can have severe consequences for their health.

Furthermore, informing cancer patients of their condition allows them to make informed decisions about their care. Without this knowledge, patients may not be able to make decisions about treatment options. For example, if a patient is unaware of the risks associated with certain treatments, they may struggle to decide on the best course of action. Not informing the patient can hinder their ability to make informed decisions about their care.

Lastly, disclosing the truth to cancer patients can help them come to terms with their diagnosis and cope with the emotional and psychological effects of their illness. Without this information, patients may struggle to process their emotions and accept their diagnosis. By informing the patient, family members can provide emotional support and help the patient cope with their illness.

In conclusion, it is crucial to change the traditional practice of withholding information from cancer patients and instead be honest with them. This will ensure they receive the best possible medical care, make informed decisions about their treatment, and cope with the emotional effects of their illness.",1
648,"The ethical debate surrounding the use of animals in scientific research has been ongoing for years. While animal testing has been instrumental in advancing medical knowledge and developing life-saving treatments, it also raises concerns about animal welfare and the morality of using sentient beings for human benefit. In my view, the harm inflicted on animals during testing outweighs the potential benefits, leading me to believe that the use of animals in scientific research should be banned.

Animal testing often involves subjecting animals to painful and distressing procedures, causing harm and suffering. This includes exposure to toxic chemicals, radiation, invasive surgery, and deliberate infection with diseases. Animals used in testing are typically kept in small cages with little stimulation, leading to psychological distress and abnormal behavior. Such practices are deemed inhumane and cruel, as it is unacceptable to subject innocent animals to such suffering.

Furthermore, there are alternatives to animal testing that can provide reliable results without causing harm to animals, such as cell cultures, computer models, and human clinical trials. These alternatives not only reduce animal suffering but also offer more accurate results based on human biology rather than animal physiology.

Lastly, the use of animals in scientific research raises moral concerns, as animals are sentient beings capable of feeling pain, suffering, and emotions. They deserve ethical consideration and should not be treated as mere objects for human benefit. It is our duty as humans to ensure that we do not cause unnecessary harm to animals, and using them in scientific research is not a necessity.

In conclusion, the use of animals in scientific research should be prohibited due to the harm it causes, the availability of alternatives, and the moral considerations involved. While animal testing has played a crucial role in medical progress, we must acknowledge the ethical implications and work towards finding alternatives that do not harm innocent animals.",1

As technology continues to play a significant role in our lives, the choices we make early on have a profound impact on our future.

One of the reasons I support early career commitment is that it allows students to utilize the resources and programs available to them. High schools often provide guidance counseling and career services to help students explore their options and make informed decisions about their future. By committing to a career early on, students can take advantage of these resources and align their education and career path accordingly.

With numerous options available, it can be overwhelming for students to choose a career path. By making a decision early on, students can concentrate on achieving their goals and avoid the stress of constantly second-guessing their choices.

While some may argue that it is premature for students to commit to a career and that they should explore their options with an open mind, I believe it is ultimately up to the individual student to determine what is best for them. For some students, committing to a career early may be appealing, while for others, it may not be the right choice.

In conclusion, although committing to a career at a young age may seem daunting to some, I believe it is a wise decision for students.

657,"Dear Principal Smith,

I am writing to share my thoughts on the proposed policy change that would mandate students to maintain a B average in order to take part in sports and other extracurricular activities. While I understand the intention of promoting academic success, I do not believe that increasing the grade requirement is the most effective approach. I have a few reasons for my disagreement with this adjustment:

To start, involvement in sports and clubs serves as a strong motivator for many students who may be struggling academically. Being a part of a team or activity provides them with goals to strive for and a support system to help them maintain their grades at a C level or higher. Without this motivation, some students may lose interest in school entirely. Requiring a B average could lead to them dropping out of activities and negatively impacting their academic performance.

Additionally, extracurricular activities teach valuable life skills such as teamwork, time management, and leadership that may not always be cultivated in the classroom. Even students with a C average should have the opportunity to acquire these benefits. A C grade indicates room for improvement, not a lack of effort or potential. These students are putting in their best effort and should not be penalized.

Lastly, raising the standard to a B average may exclude many capable students who work diligently but struggle in certain subjects. Not everyone learns at the same way or at the same pace. As long as they are passing their classes at a C level or higher, they are making progress academically. A one-size-fits-all policy is overly strict.

In conclusion, I believe that the current requirement of a C average strikes a good balance between promoting academics and allowing for full school participation. Most students with a C average are motivated individuals who make significant contributions to our school through their involvement in extracurricular activities. I urge you to reconsider this proposed change. Please let me know if you would like me to provide further clarification on my perspective.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I am writing to share my thoughts on the electoral college system and its role in electing the President of the United States. While I understand the arguments for getting rid of the electoral college and having the President elected by popular vote, I believe that the current system is fair and efficient and should be kept.

One of the main arguments against the electoral college is that it is unfair to voters. The winner-take-all system in our state means that candidates focus only on swing states, neglecting others. However, I believe this is necessary to ensure the President is elected by the entire country, not just a few states.

Another argument is that the electoral college is outdated and does not represent the will of the people. However, I think it has been effective in ensuring the President is elected by the entire country. It has been in place since the founding of the US and has successfully ensured the President is elected by the people.

Additionally, I believe the electoral college system provides a check on the power of the people. It ensures the President is not elected by a small group of voters in key states, but by the entire country. This balances the power of the people and ensures the President is elected by all.

Lastly, I believe the electoral college system creates a fair playing field for all candidates. Candidates must appeal to a wide range of voters, not just a specific group in key states. This levels the playing field and ensures the President is elected by all.

In conclusion, I believe the electoral college system is fair, effective, and balances the power of the people. I urge you to consider the benefits of the current system and keep it in place for electing the President.

This means that larger groups may incur higher costs, but the extra expense can result in a more enriching and enjoyable trip than if one were to explore on their own.",1
679,"A few years ago, I made an error and was charged with a minor offense. This experience taught me that even small mistakes can have significant consequences and long-lasting effects. As part of my sentence, I had to complete 120 hours of community service. Despite initially feeling overwhelmed by the commitment, I soon realized the value of giving back to the community. Through this experience, I connected with people I would not have otherwise met.

I discovered a passion for helping others and found fulfillment in seeing the positive impact my service had on those in need. I eagerly volunteered for additional opportunities to make the most of my required hours. This experience taught me the importance of service and inspired me to continue volunteering with various organizations.

I have developed a newfound appreciation for the communities I serve and the importance of being of service. Despite stemming from a negative experience, I now see giving back as a consequence I am more than willing to embrace.",1

685,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my belief that the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States should be replaced with a popular vote. While the Electoral College was originally intended to give smaller states more influence, recent elections have shown significant drawbacks to this approach that outweigh its original intent.

One issue with the Electoral College is that it can lead to a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote, as seen in the 2000 and 2016 elections. Some argue that this goes against the principle of one person, one vote. While smaller states were meant to have more power through the electoral system, many now feel that the popular vote better reflects the will of the people overall.

Some argue that without the Electoral College, candidates would only focus on population centers, ignoring smaller states. However, with the majority of Americans living in urban areas, candidates already heavily target major media markets. A popular vote may not neglect smaller states any more than the current system does. Additionally, votes from states with fewer electors currently have less individual impact. A popular vote would give all citizens an equal voice regardless of where they live.

Transitioning to a popular vote could also increase voter turnout. Some voters feel their votes don't matter in heavily Democratic or Republican states where the outcome seems predetermined. National elections where every vote counts could generate more interest and participation, which is crucial for the health of our democratic process.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College had good intentions, the changing landscape of our nation calls for a system that serves all citizens equally. A national popular vote for president appears to be a fairer approach aligned with the principle of one person, one vote. For these reasons, I believe switching to a popular vote system is worth considering and discussing further.

Thank you for your time and dedication. Please reach out if you have any additional questions.

686,"Dear Mrs. Smith,

I understand that you are considering implementing a policy that requires students to maintain at least a B average in order to participate in sports and other activities. I believe this is not a good idea, and I will explain why.

Firstly, not everyone excels in academics. Some students may excel in sports, music, or art, but struggle in school. If they are unable to participate in activities they enjoy, they may become discouraged and lose motivation.

Secondly, achieving a C average is still a respectable accomplishment. It is not equivalent to failing, and some students may be putting in their best effort and still only achieve a C. It is unfair to penalize them for something beyond their control.

Lastly, sports and extracurricular activities are important for personal development. They teach us teamwork, discipline, and the value of hard work. They also provide a source of relaxation and enjoyment. Denying students these opportunities simply because they are not top performers in school is unjust.

I urge you to reconsider this policy and explore alternative ways to support students in their academic endeavors. Perhaps providing additional assistance or making school more engaging and enjoyable could be more effective.

Thank you for considering my perspective.

Sincerely,

Jill Doe",1

691,"There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on one's perspective of what is important for students. However, I believe that it is more crucial for students to grasp ideas and concepts rather than simply memorizing facts.

One reason why understanding ideas and concepts is more valuable than rote memorization is that facts can easily be forgotten, whereas understanding can be applied to new situations. For instance, a student who memorizes the dates of U.S. presidents may struggle to explain their impact on the country, whereas a student who understands the concept of democracy can apply it to various situations and explain its effects.

Another reason why understanding ideas and concepts is essential is that it helps students develop critical thinking skills. Simply memorizing facts may allow students to answer questions, but it does not encourage them to think critically about the information. Understanding concepts, on the other hand, enables students to analyze why events occurred and their implications.

In conclusion, I believe that it is more important for students to comprehend ideas and concepts rather than focus solely on memorizing facts. This is because understanding allows for application to new situations, fosters critical thinking skills, and encourages a more sophisticated approach to complex issues.",1

Imitating others can hinder personal growth as it may prevent individuals from discovering their own talents and abilities. Striving to be like a ""perfect"" role model can lead to disappointment and may not always result in the best choices. On the other hand, learning to think and act independently can be empowering, as it fosters a strong sense of identity and equips individuals to overcome challenges. Seeking guidance from mentors is valuable, but it should be weighed against one's own values and goals.

In conclusion, while role models can be helpful, individuals should strive to think and act independently. Copying others may impede personal growth, and the idea of a flawless role model is flawed. Making decisions based on one's own values and goals is crucial for personal development and success.",1

When you approach things with enthusiasm and optimism, you are more likely to persevere through challenges. For instance, if you want to start a band but face discouragement from your parents, you don't give up. Instead, you keep practicing until you excel at playing the drums. Enthusiasm and optimism can help you overcome obstacles and achieve your goals.

Moreover, having a positive outlook allows you to see the good in things. Even on a bad day, you can still appreciate having friends or learning something new. By always looking for the silver lining, you can stay motivated and focused on your objectives.

I am writing to share my views on the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. After reviewing information from various sources, including articles by the Office of the Federal Register, Bradford Plume, and Judge Richard A. Poster, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept for several important reasons.

One reason to maintain the Electoral College is the certainty it provides in election outcomes. The system ensures that the winning candidate's share of electoral votes exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing disputes and providing a clear winner. Additionally, the system encourages candidates to appeal to multiple regions, ensuring that the President represents a broad range of interests.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes an engaged and informed electorate by focusing campaign efforts on swing states. This allows thoughtful voters to decide the election and ensures that the President represents the entire nation, not just a specific region. The system also balances political power between large and small states, preventing candidates from focusing solely on highly populated areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the complexities of runoff elections by producing a clear winner and upholding the stability of the election process. While some argue that the system may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning, voter turnout is driven by the desire to express political preferences rather than deciding the outcome.

In conclusion, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College is crucial for ensuring certainty, broad representation, an engaged electorate, a balanced distribution of power, and a clear winner in presidential elections. I urge you to consider these reasons and support the continuation of the Electoral College as the method of choosing the President of the United States.

701,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my strong support for eliminating the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States based on the popular vote.

The Electoral College was established in 1787 during the drafting of the Constitution to ensure that all states had a say in the presidential election. However, with the United States now being a much larger country, the Electoral College is no longer necessary and actually harms our democracy.

The current system gives more power to voters in smaller states compared to those in larger states, as each state has a number of electors based on its senators and representatives. This results in voters in states like Wyoming having more influence than those in states like California.

Additionally, the Electoral College leads candidates to focus on swing states, neglecting the needs of voters in states that are already considered safe for one party or the other. This has also resulted in instances where the candidate who won the popular vote did not win the presidency, as seen in the 2016 election.

It is time to abolish the outdated and undemocratic Electoral College system and elect the President based on the popular vote. I urge you to support this important reform. Thank you for your time.

I am writing to share my views on the issue of whether to keep the Electoral College or switch to a popular vote system for electing the president of the United States. After reviewing arguments from various sources, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained. While there are valid concerns raised by supporters of a popular vote system, the Electoral College has proven to be a necessary compromise that ensures fair representation of all states and regions in the presidential election.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of the outcome. Judge Richard A. Posner explains that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College always exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the election results. The winner-takes-all method of awarding electoral votes also allows for a clear winner to emerge without the need for runoff elections.

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes unity and appeals to multiple regions. Candidates must have broad support across different regions, ensuring that the president represents the interests of the entire country rather than just one region. By focusing on swing states, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in these states, leading to greater voter engagement and informed decision-making.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of large and small states in the political process. Large states receive more attention from candidates during campaigns, but the Electoral College ensures that the concerns of both large and small states are considered. Despite criticisms of the system, such as candidates focusing only on swing states and some voters feeling disenfranchised, the benefits of the Electoral College outweigh these concerns.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is an essential part of our democracy that should be preserved. Its practical advantages allow for a fair and effective election process that represents the diverse interests and regions of our nation.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to share my support for the Electoral College and explain why I believe it should be maintained rather than replaced by a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States. I have carefully considered various arguments on this topic and firmly believe that the Electoral College serves an important purpose.

The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between different methods of electing the President. It involves the selection of electors, their voting process, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. Each state's allotment of electors is based on its Congressional delegation, ensuring fair representation.

One common criticism of the Electoral College is that it is undemocratic. However, it is important to recognize that democracy can also include representative democracy, where electors chosen by political parties vote for their party's nominee, reflecting the will of the people.

One key reason to retain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. Unlike a direct popular vote system, disputes over the election results are less likely due to the winner-take-all allocation of electoral votes in most states. This reduces the possibility of recounts and legal challenges.

The Electoral College also ensures that the President has transregional appeal, as no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President. Candidates must campaign in various states across different regions, promoting a broader understanding of regional interests and preventing disenfranchisement.

Additionally, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states, where the election outcome is uncertain. Prioritizing these states ensures that informed voters who pay close attention to the campaign have a significant say in the election.

The Electoral College also balances the political influence of large and small states, giving smaller states more attention in the campaign process. It eliminates the need for runoff elections by consistently producing a clear winner based on the most electoral votes.

In conclusion, the benefits of retaining the Electoral College, such as certainty of outcome, transregional appeal, swing states, balancing political influence, and avoiding runoff elections, outweigh the criticisms. The Electoral College provides fair representation of voters' needs and interests while maintaining the stability and integrity of the presidential election process.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue. I hope you will take into account the practical reasons supporting the retention of the Electoral College. If you have any further questions or need more information, please feel free to contact me.

This essay will discuss the advantages of ECAs for students and advocate for students to have autonomy over their involvement in these activities.

To begin with, ECAs can enhance a student's college admissions prospects by showcasing their dedication, passion, and commitment to personal development. Many colleges and universities value extracurricular involvement when evaluating applications, viewing students who participate in ECAs as well-rounded individuals with a higher chance of acceptance. For instance, students engaged in sports or clubs related to their career aspirations may have a competitive edge in the admissions process.

Furthermore, ECAs can open doors to scholarship opportunities for students. Various scholarships are available to those involved in specific ECAs, such as the Horatio Alger Association Scholarship, which supports students who have faced challenges and engaged in community service. These scholarships can provide financial assistance for students to pursue their academic and professional goals.

Additionally, participating in ECAs can help students develop essential time management skills by balancing academic responsibilities with extracurricular commitments. This experience teaches students how to prioritize tasks and effectively manage their time, leading to improved organizational skills and study habits that can positively impact academic performance.

Moreover, ECAs offer students the chance to explore personal interests, fostering a sense of fulfillment and happiness. Engaging in activities like debate or drama clubs can help students develop public speaking abilities and confidence, allowing them to discover and nurture their passions.

Despite these benefits, there are arguments against schools dictating students' participation in ECAs. Some believe that schools should prioritize academics and view ECAs as a distraction from core curriculum. Additionally, there is opposition to forcing students into activities they are not interested in.

In conclusion, ECAs present numerous advantages for students, from enhancing college admissions prospects to fostering personal growth and skill development.

While some argue that phones can enhance student learning, I believe they can hinder it. In this essay, I will explain why I think students should not have phones in classrooms by providing evidence for each point.

To begin with, having phones in classrooms can be a distraction for students. Research has shown that students who use their phones during class are more likely to miss important information and have difficulty focusing. This is because phones are designed to be engaging and addictive, leading students to spend time on social media or games instead of paying attention to the lesson.

Additionally, phones can facilitate cheating. With the internet accessible on phones, students may be tempted to cheat on exams or assignments by looking up answers online. This not only devalues education but also teaches students that cheating is acceptable.

Furthermore, phones can be a distraction for other students in the class. If one student is using their phone, it can disrupt the learning environment for their peers, making it challenging for everyone to concentrate on the lesson.

Lastly, phones can also distract the teacher. If a student is using their phone, it can be difficult for the teacher to monitor their behavior and ensure they are following classroom rules. This can create a sense of loss of control for the teacher.

In conclusion, while there are potential benefits to having phones in classrooms for educational purposes, I believe that the negative impact on student learning outweighs the positives. Students who use their phones in class are more likely to miss important information, cheat, distract others, and disrupt the teacher. Therefore, I believe that students should not have phones in classrooms.",1
714,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to share my views on the Electoral College. I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and unjust system that should be eliminated.

The Electoral College was established in 1787 as a compromise between the interests of large and small states. While large states wanted the president to be elected by popular vote, small states wanted equal representation. The Electoral College was a way to satisfy both sides.

However, the Electoral College is no longer necessary. The United States is now a much more diverse country, and the popular vote is a more accurate reflection of the people's will. In recent presidential elections, the winner of the popular vote has lost the election twice, which is unfair to the majority of voters.

There are several reasons why I believe the Electoral College should be abolished. Firstly, it gives too much power to a small number of states. In 2016, Donald Trump won the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. This is because Trump won key states by narrow margins, while Hillary Clinton won by large margins in many other states. This system gives disproportionate power to swing states and devalues the votes of people in other states.

Secondly, the Electoral College discourages voter participation. People in states that are considered safe for one party often feel like their votes do not matter because the outcome is already decided. In 2016, over 40 million votes were essentially meaningless because they were cast in states where the result was already known.

Lastly, the Electoral College is undemocratic. The popular vote is a more accurate representation of the people's will, and in a democracy, the majority should rule. The Electoral College allows a minority of voters to elect the president, which is unfair.

I urge you to support the abolition of the Electoral College. It is an outdated and unfair system that should be replaced with a more democratic and equitable system for all voters.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",1

722,"Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to share my views on the Electoral College system and its importance in the presidential election process. While there is ongoing debate about whether the Electoral College should be eliminated in favor of a popular vote system, I believe it remains a vital component of our democratic system.

One key argument in support of the Electoral College is that it ensures a more accurate representation of the popular vote. By awarding electoral votes based on the popular vote within each state, the Electoral College ensures that the president is elected by a diverse coalition of states, rather than just the most populous ones. This encourages candidates to campaign in all states, not just the most populous ones.

Additionally, the Electoral College prevents a candidate from winning the presidency without broad national support. It requires a candidate to have appeal across regions, as no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. This encourages candidates to focus on swing states, which are more likely to determine the outcome of the election.",1

725,"When it comes to education, there are two main philosophies: the transmission of knowledge and the development of understanding. The first approach focuses on students memorizing facts and figures, while the second emphasizes the importance of students being able to think critically and apply their knowledge to new situations. I believe that the latter approach is more important for several reasons.

Firstly, it is impossible for students to know everything. Even if they memorize a lot of information, they will eventually encounter a problem where they do not know the answer. However, if they have developed critical thinking skills, they will be able to find a solution. For example, a student who has learned about the American Revolution in history class may be able to apply that knowledge to a debate about the revolution's merits.

Secondly, understanding ideas and concepts allows students to apply their knowledge in various contexts. For instance, a student who understands the concept of gravity can use that knowledge to solve a physics problem, but they can also apply it to understand why a ball bounces or why a car slows down when the brakes are applied.

Lastly, understanding ideas and concepts helps students to develop their own thinking. When faced with a new problem, students can draw on their past learning to come up with a solution. This is particularly crucial in fields like science and mathematics, where new discoveries are constantly being made.

In conclusion, I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than just memorize facts. This approach enables students to think critically and apply their knowledge to new situations, which is essential for their future success.",1

Additionally, social media has empowered ordinary citizens to voice their opinions and engage in political conversations, leading to a more informed and engaged population.

Furthermore, social media has significantly impacted culture and popular trends. Influencers and celebrities on platforms like Instagram and TikTok have a strong influence on how people dress, behave, and consume products. This has resulted in a global sharing of trends and ideas, creating a sense of unity among different cultures.

Lastly, social media has transformed relationships and social interactions by making it easier for people to connect regardless of distance. However, it has also led to a decrease in face-to-face communication and an increase in negative behaviors like cyberbullying.

It is crucial to not only understand and appreciate our own culture but also to have knowledge of and respect for other cultures. I strongly believe that in order to fully comprehend one's own culture, it is necessary to have personal experience with at least one culture that is distinctly different. In this essay, I will present arguments to support this perspective.

To begin with, exposure to different cultures helps us become more open-minded and tolerant. By learning about the customs, traditions, and beliefs of other cultures, we gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for the diversity of the world. This enables us to respect and accept those who are different from us, fostering a sense of global citizenship. For example, someone from a Western culture who learns about the traditional Korean practice of bowing may be more accepting of this custom when encountering it in Korea.

Furthermore, understanding other cultures allows us to better appreciate the unique characteristics and values of our own culture. Through comparison, we gain insight into what makes our culture special and what lessons we can learn from it. For instance, an individual from a culture that values independence, like the United States, may come to appreciate the emphasis on family and community in a collectivistic culture such as China.

Additionally, knowledge of other cultures enhances our ability to communicate effectively with individuals from diverse backgrounds. By recognizing and understanding language barriers, behavioral norms, and other cultural differences, we can navigate interactions more successfully and avoid misunderstandings. This is particularly crucial in fields like international business and diplomacy. For example, a diplomat from the United States negotiating with a counterpart from Japan would benefit greatly from understanding Japanese culture to navigate the nuances of the negotiation.

Lastly, exposure to other cultures provides us with valuable life lessons by offering insights into their history, struggles, and achievements. This knowledge can be inspiring and empowering, offering a fresh perspective on our own challenges and fostering resilience in the face of adversity. For instance, learning about the hardships faced by the people of Rwanda during the genocide may inspire us to advocate for human rights and work towards a better world.

In conclusion, gaining knowledge of at least one other culture is essential for a comprehensive understanding and appreciation of one's own culture. Exposure to different cultures promotes open-mindedness, enhances cultural appreciation, improves communication with diverse individuals, and imparts valuable life lessons.

757,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for eliminating the Electoral College. I believe that this system is outdated and undemocratic, as it does not accurately represent the will of the people.

The Electoral College was established in the 18th century as a compromise between those who wanted the president to be elected by Congress and those who preferred a popular vote. While it was intended to give smaller states more power to protect their interests, it no longer serves its original purpose in the 21st century.

Recent elections have shown that the candidate who wins the popular vote can still lose the election, causing frustration among voters who feel their voices are not being heard. Additionally, the Electoral College leads to candidates focusing on swing states, neglecting the needs of voters in states that are considered safe for one party.

I believe that abolishing the Electoral College and electing the president by popular vote is the best way to ensure that the president is chosen by the people. This would give all voters an equal say in the election and ensure that the candidate with the most votes wins.

I urge you to support a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College. This would make our presidential elections more democratic and representative.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

759,"Here is my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student on the topic of graduating from high school in three years:

Hello everyone! Today, we are discussing the idea of some schools allowing students to graduate from high school in three years instead of the traditional four. While some people support this idea, I have some reservations. Let me explain why.

On the positive side, graduating in three years means you can start college or enter the workforce a year earlier than your peers. This could give you a head start in life and reduce the time spent in high school, which can be stressful. However, some students may not be emotionally ready to leave high school early, and that is completely understandable.

On the other hand, I am not sure if I could handle the workload of three years of high school. What if I do not meet the requirements for college? This could be embarrassing and disappointing. Additionally, skipping out on traditional high school experiences like prom could make me feel like I am missing out on a crucial part of growing up.

Furthermore, the social aspect is important to consider. Students who spend four years in high school have more time to make friends and form bonds, while I may struggle to keep up if I graduate early. It could leave me feeling left behind and isolated.

In conclusion, I am hesitant about the idea of graduating from high school in three years. The pressure and stress may be too much for me to handle at this point in my life. However, if this option appeals to you, then go for it.",1

762,"In recent years, the popularity of taking classes from home has increased significantly, and for good reason. There are multiple advantages to learning from the convenience of your own home, such as flexibility, convenience, and increased productivity. In this essay, I will delve into these benefits and explain why studying from home is a beneficial option for students of all ages.

One major advantage of studying from home is the convenience it offers. Online classes allow students to attend lectures and complete assignments without the need to commute to a physical campus. This eliminates the hassle of waking up early, packing a bag, and traveling on public transportation, allowing students to focus on their studies and work at their own pace.

Another benefit of studying from home is the flexibility it provides. Online classes often offer various scheduling options, enabling students to attend lectures and complete assignments at times that suit their individual needs. This is particularly beneficial for students with other commitments, such as jobs or family responsibilities, as they can balance their studies with their other obligations and still achieve academic success.

Furthermore, studying from home can lead to increased productivity. Without the distractions of a busy campus, students are more focused and motivated to complete their work. Additionally, online classes offer access to resources like online tutoring and study groups, enhancing the learning experience and helping students achieve their academic goals.

Not having to leave home is also a significant advantage of studying from home. Learning in a comfortable and familiar environment can reduce stress and anxiety associated with attending a physical campus, leading to a more enjoyable and stress-free learning experience and ultimately better academic performance.

Parents can also have greater trust in students who study from home, as they can be confident that their children are dedicating time to studying and completing assignments. This can foster a sense of trust and security for both parents and students.

Moreover, the ability to attend lectures and complete assignments from anywhere with an Internet connection is a positive aspect of studying from home.",1
763,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to ask for your support in eliminating the Electoral College and implementing a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States. The Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that does not accurately represent the desires of the American people.

Originally established in the 18th century when the country was much smaller, the Electoral College was intended to provide smaller states with a voice in the presidential election. However, with the significant growth in population and the equal representation of all states in the Senate, this system is no longer necessary. It is unfair to give smaller states an advantage in the election process.

The Electoral College is undemocratic as it has resulted in instances where the candidate who won the popular vote did not win the presidency. This has occurred five times in U.S. history, most notably in the 2000 election where Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency to George W. Bush. This disenfranchises millions of voters.

Additionally, the Electoral College contributes to voter suppression through restrictive laws that make it difficult for certain groups, such as minorities and young voters, to cast their ballots. A national popular vote system would ensure that every vote is equal and that the candidate with the most votes wins the presidency, accurately reflecting the will of the people.

I urge you to support the abolition of the Electoral College and the adoption of a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States. This change would be a more democratic and fair method of selecting our leader.

765,"Dear Principal Smith,

I am writing to discuss the proposal of making community service mandatory for all students. While helping the community can teach valuable life skills, there is a concern that forcing students to participate may diminish the positive impact and take away valuable free time.

There are strong arguments in favor of incorporating community service into our school requirements. Volunteering allows students to assist those in need and contribute to the local community. It can also help develop empathy, compassion, and civic engagement from a young age. Engaging in activities like tutoring, park cleanup, or assisting at homeless shelters can have a positive impact on people's lives and help students learn responsibility, teamwork, and the value of service.

However, there is a risk that mandatory volunteerism could have negative consequences. Students may begin to resent being required to help others and see it as a chore rather than a meaningful experience. With academic demands already taking up much of their time, adding additional responsibilities could burden them and limit their precious free time needed for creativity, stress relief, and personal well-being.

Instead of making community service a blanket requirement for all students, I believe it would be more effective to strongly encourage volunteerism without making it mandatory. This allows those who are passionate about helping others to participate without penalizing those with legitimate time constraints. Recognizing individual efforts through awards or letters of recommendation can still promote civic engagement effectively. While the intention behind mandatory community service is commendable, it may unintentionally diminish its impact and burden students. For these reasons, I do not support requiring all students to participate.

766,"Hello, it's me, a typical 8th grader! I'm really excited to write this essay about the importance of being true to yourself and not letting others dictate who you are. I know it may sound cliché, but hear me out, okay?

Let's start by discussing the value of being unique. Being different is what sets us apart and makes us special. If everyone was the same, life would be incredibly dull. Our diverse interests and personalities make the world a more interesting place.

It can be challenging to be yourself, especially when others don't understand or appreciate your individuality. For example, I love art and music, while some of my friends prefer sports and video games. They may not understand my passions and even tease me for them, but I don't let it bother me. I will continue to pursue what I love, even if others don't understand.

Being true to yourself also boosts your confidence. When you embrace who you are, you become more self-assured in your abilities and beliefs. If you excel in science and math, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Confidence is crucial in facing life's challenges and not giving up when things get tough.

For instance, if you enjoy drama and theater but your friends are more into sports, don't feel pressured to join their team. It's perfectly fine to follow your own interests and not succumb to peer pressure. Stay true to yourself and pursue what makes you happy.",1
767,"Hello!

768,"Humans have a tendency to remember negative actions more than positive ones, so it is suggested that the most effective way to teach is to praise positive actions and overlook negative ones. I agree with this approach because praising positive actions can inspire individuals to keep doing good things, while ignoring negative actions can prevent them from feeling disheartened and unmotivated. In this essay, I will present specific reasons and examples to support this viewpoint.

To start, praising positive actions can motivate individuals to continue their good behavior. Everyone appreciates recognition for their hard work and dedication. When individuals are praised for their positive actions, they are encouraged to keep up the good work. For example, a student who is praised for achieving good grades will be motivated to work even harder to maintain their academic success. Similarly, an employee who is commended for their efforts will be motivated to excel in their work.

Additionally, disregarding negative actions can help individuals avoid feeling discouraged and losing motivation. Constant criticism for negative actions can lead to a decline in confidence and motivation. While negative actions should not be completely ignored, they should not be overly emphasized. Instead, individuals should be encouraged to learn from their mistakes and focus on improvement. For instance, a child who is constantly scolded for their errors may lose motivation. However, if the child is encouraged to learn from their mistakes and strive to do better next time, they will feel more motivated and self-assured.

Furthermore, praising positive actions can contribute to building self-esteem and confidence in individuals. Recognition for positive actions can boost individuals' self-esteem and confidence, which are crucial for personal and professional growth. For example, when a child is praised for their good behavior, they will feel good about themselves and become more confident in their ability to behave well in the future.

Lastly, ignoring negative actions can help individuals develop a growth mindset. A growth mindset involves believing that abilities can be developed through hard work and dedication. By ignoring negative actions and focusing on improvement, individuals are encouraged to adopt a growth mindset. This mindset is essential for personal and professional growth as it motivates individuals to enhance their skills and abilities. For instance, if an employee is encouraged to learn from their mistakes rather than being criticized, they will concentrate on improving themselves rather than feeling disheartened.

In conclusion, praising positive actions and disregarding negative ones is an effective teaching method. Praising positive actions can motivate individuals, boost self-esteem and confidence, and foster a growth mindset. Ignoring negative actions can prevent individuals from feeling discouraged and motivate them to learn from their mistakes. Therefore, educators, employers, and parents should focus on praising positive actions and encouraging individuals to learn from their errors rather than criticizing them for their negative actions.",1

James was notorious for his audacious escapes from law enforcement and his adeptness at outsmarting his pursuers. He frequently concealed himself in plain sight, blending in with the local populace, utilizing disguises and aliases to confound his adversaries.

Despite his fearlessness, James encountered numerous challenges in his life. As a criminal wanted by authorities in multiple states, he constantly lived in fear of being apprehended. He understood that a single misstep could result in capture and inevitable demise.

A cowboy who rode the waves must also possess resourcefulness and adaptability. James had to continuously adjust to new circumstances and devise innovative solutions to problems. He excelled at improvisation, whether it entailed devising a means to cross a river or elude a particularly persistent pursuer.

Moreover, a cowboy who rode the waves values freedom and independence. James was renowned for his fiery temperament and his disdain for authority. He firmly believed in being his own master and harbored animosity towards those who sought to constrain or regulate him.

779,"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student on the topic of caring for a bearded dragon:

Hello! So, you're interested in caring for a bearded dragon, right? Well, let me tell you, they make pretty cool pets! They're like mini dragons, aren't they? But before you decide to get one, you need to be fully prepared to take care of it.

First and foremost, you need to understand what bearded dragons require to thrive. They need a spacious enclosure, proper food, water, and other essentials. They need a warm environment, with temperatures ranging between 75-85 degrees Fahrenheit. They also need UV light to help them produce vitamin D, as they cannot do so on their own. Additionally, they need a basking spot, like a heat lamp, to warm up. And they need a cooler area with rocks for them to cool off.

You also need to consider the size of the enclosure. Bearded dragons can grow up to 18 inches long and 12 inches wide, so the cage must be large enough for them to move around and stretch out. It should also be tall enough for them to climb, so you'll need to provide climbing structures like rocks or branches.

However, the most crucial aspect is providing a suitable living environment. Bearded dragons are social animals and enjoy the company of other dragons. They like to play and bask together, so it's recommended to have two or more dragons. Ensure they have enough space to move around and interact with each other.

Now, let's talk about their diet. Bearded dragons primarily eat bugs like crickets and mealworms. They also require calcium for strong bones and teeth. Therefore, it's important to provide them with a balanced diet.",1

786,"Hello, Mrs. Johnson! 😃

I need to write an essay about whether I agree with Winston Churchill's statement that success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasm. I believe I will disagree with him. 🤔

First, let's consider what success means. I believe it is when you achieve your goals and feel happy and proud of yourself. If you keep failing and losing enthusiasm, that doesn't sound like success to me. It sounds like, well, failure! 😅

However, I can understand why Churchill might say that. If you keep trying things and they don't work out, you might start to feel like you're never going to succeed. And if you lose your enthusiasm, it can be hard to keep trying. But, I think it's important to remember that every failure is a chance to learn and try again.

For instance, last year I auditioned for the school play, but I didn't get the part I wanted. I was initially disappointed, but then I realized that it was okay. I could try again next year and do better. And you know what? I did! 🎭

So, I don't believe that going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasm is the way to success. I think it's important to keep trying and learning, even when things don't go your way at first. And if you lose enthusiasm, you can always find it again by reminding yourself of your goals and why you're trying so hard.

I hope that makes sense! 🤞

Subject: Supporting the Electoral College System

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my endorsement of the Electoral College system in our presidential elections. The Electoral College, which combines election by Congress and popular vote, has been beneficial for our nation and should be maintained for several reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a clear outcome and reduces the likelihood of election disputes. The system guarantees that the winning candidate's share of electoral votes always exceeds their popular vote share, minimizing the possibility of a contested election result.

Secondly, the Electoral College fosters national unity by requiring presidential candidates to appeal to a broad range of voters. This ensures that the president represents the interests of various regions rather than just one specific area.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on swing states, giving these voters a significant say in the election and promoting voter engagement and informed decision-making.

Furthermore, the system balances the political power of large and small states, ensuring that both are taken into account in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College simplifies the election process by avoiding the need for runoff elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states dominated by one party, it is important to note that voting in presidential elections is a way for individuals to express their political preferences.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be a valuable compromise that ensures a clear outcome, promotes unity, empowers swing states, balances political power, and avoids the need for runoff elections. It is crucial for maintaining the integrity of our democratic system. I urge you to consider these points when evaluating any potential changes to our election process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your dedication to serving our state and country. I look forward to your continued support for our democratic principles.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1

It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Jefferson believed that staying busy would lead to greater accomplishments, a sentiment I agree with. This essay will argue that staying busy is crucial for personal growth and success.

To begin with, staying busy allows us to be more productive and achieve more than we would otherwise. When we are busy, we are forced to prioritize tasks and focus on what is most important, leading to increased efficiency and a sense of satisfaction. For instance, working on a group project taught me that being focused and busy with my team helped us accomplish more in less time.

Furthermore, staying busy helps us understand our own limitations and weaknesses, leading to personal growth and self-awareness. Confronting challenges while constantly engaged in activities can help us develop new skills and strategies for success. For example, facing a difficult project at work forced me to adapt and learn, ultimately improving my understanding of my strengths and weaknesses.

Lastly, staying busy can help us establish good habits and routines, fostering discipline and self-control. This can result in better time management, increased productivity, and a sense of achievement. Developing a consistent routine while working on a long-term project helped me stay focused and make progress towards my goals.

In conclusion, staying busy is essential for personal growth and success. By prioritizing tasks, focusing energy, and establishing good habits, we can achieve more and gain valuable insights about ourselves.

I am writing to share my thoughts on the Electoral College and to ask for your support in keeping this system for electing the President of the United States. While there are arguments for and against it, I believe that the Electoral College is essential for our democracy and ensures that all citizens and regions are represented.

One key benefit of the Electoral College is the clear outcome it provides. According to Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate usually receives a higher share of Electoral College votes than the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of disputes and legal battles.

Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that every region has a voice in electing the President. By requiring candidates to have broad appeal, it prevents them from focusing solely on specific regions and neglecting others.

The system also encourages candidates to campaign in swing states and address the concerns of these voters. This leads to a more engaged electorate and a president who is responsive to a wide range of Americans.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of large and small states, ensuring that all states are considered in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections by consistently producing a clear winner, promoting stability in the election process.

Despite criticisms, I believe that the practical benefits of the Electoral College outweigh the drawbacks. It upholds our federal system, ensures all regions are represented, and maintains stability in presidential elections.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this issue. I hope you will support keeping the Electoral College as part of our democratic process. Please reach out if you would like to discuss further.

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to share my thoughts on the Electoral College and the potential shift to a direct popular vote for the President of the United States. As we approach the upcoming election, it is important to reconsider the role of the Electoral College and its impact on our democratic process.

The Electoral College was created as a compromise to ensure fair representation for each state based on its population. It allocates electors to each state based on its congressional representation, balancing power between densely populated and smaller states. Moving to a direct popular vote could give disproportionate influence to heavily populated states, neglecting the interests of smaller states.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides certainty in election outcomes. It ensures that the winning candidate has a clear majority of electoral votes, preventing disputes over close elections. This system also requires presidential candidates to have broad support across different regions, promoting national unity and avoiding regional candidates from winning.

Moreover, the Electoral College gives large states more attention during campaigns, balancing their political power and engaging voters in all states. It also eliminates the need for runoff elections, ensuring a decisive outcome without prolonged voting processes.

While there are criticisms of the Electoral College, the benefits of maintaining it, such as state representation, certainty of outcomes, national unity, and balanced political power, outweigh these concerns. I urge you to consider the importance of preserving the Electoral College for a fair and effective presidential election process.

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to you today as a concerned citizen to advocate for the preservation of the Electoral College system in our presidential elections. Despite differing opinions, I believe the Electoral College plays an essential role in upholding our nation’s democratic principles and ensuring fair representation of all states in the electoral process.

The Founding Fathers established the Electoral College to balance the power of the majority with the rights of individual states. According to Judge Richard A. Posner in his article 'In Defense of the Electoral College', the Electoral College promotes regional appeal rather than a concentration of power in highly populated areas. This system ensures that candidates address the needs of all citizens, not just those in populous regions.

The Electoral College also prevents unresolved election outcomes. The majority vote requirement makes a decisive outcome more likely, reducing the chance of election disputes and eliminating the need for costly runoff elections.

While I understand concerns about the Electoral College's fairness, as argued by Bradford Plume, it is important to recognize that the system maintains a necessary compromise to keep our diverse country united under a common federal structure.

In conclusion, despite its complexity and potential for anomalies, the Electoral College represents each American's voice and is worth preserving. I urge you to support retaining this system in Congress.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this important issue.

Sincerely,

822,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for eliminating the Electoral College and instead electing the President of the United States through a popular vote. I believe this is necessary to ensure that every American has an equal say in our democracy.

The Electoral College is an outdated system that no longer represents the values of our country. It was established when there were only 13 states and when travel and communication were much more challenging. In today's world, it is unnecessary to have a system that gives certain states more power than others.

Furthermore, the Electoral College has been proven to be undemocratic. In recent elections, there have been instances where the candidate who won the popular vote did not win the election. This is because the Electoral College allocates all of a state's electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in that state, even by a small margin. This system unfairly benefits candidates from small states and disregards the votes of millions in larger states.

I believe that electing the President through a popular vote is the most fair method. Every American should have an equal say in choosing our leader. The Electoral College does not provide this equality, and it is time to abolish it.

I urge you to support the elimination of the Electoral College and the adoption of a popular vote system for electing the President. Thank you for your attention.

825,"Dear State Senator,

I am writing to share my thoughts on the Electoral College and its impact on the presidential election process. As a 9th grade student, I have been studying the Constitution and the intentions of the Founding Fathers in creating the Electoral College. While I believe the Electoral College has been effective in giving smaller states a voice, I also recognize the arguments for electing the President by popular vote.

The Electoral College ensures that smaller states are not overlooked in the election process, as candidates would otherwise focus solely on larger states with higher populations. This system promotes democracy and fair representation by giving each state a certain number of electoral votes regardless of size, encouraging candidates to campaign nationwide.

Additionally, the Electoral College prevents the President from being elected solely based on the popular vote, ensuring a broad coalition of states support the President. This encourages candidates to appeal to voters across different regions rather than focusing on specific areas.

While I acknowledge concerns about the Electoral College potentially allowing the popular vote winner to lose the presidency, I believe reform is a better solution than abolition. One proposal is to adopt a proportional representation system like Maine and Nebraska, where electoral votes are awarded based on the percentage of the popular vote in each state. Another suggestion is to increase the number of electoral votes for each state based on population, giving more weight to the popular vote while still representing smaller states.

In conclusion, I believe the Electoral College has been beneficial but support reform to make it more representative and democratic. I urge you to consider these proposals and work towards a solution that ensures fair representation for all Americans.

827,"The debate surrounding meat consumption has been a hot topic in recent years, with many calling for a decrease in meat consumption due to concerns about the environment and health. As a high school student, I believe that switching to a vegetarian or vegan diet is essential for a sustainable future.

One of the main reasons for reducing meat consumption is the environmental impact of animal agriculture. The production of meat requires a significant amount of resources, such as land, water, and energy. According to a study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the livestock sector is responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the entire transportation sector. Additionally, the use of chemicals in animal agriculture pollutes the soil, air, and water.

Another important reason for adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is the health benefits. Plant-based diets have been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. This is because plant-based diets are high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and low in saturated fats and cholesterol. For example, a study published in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found that vegetarian diets were associated with a 12% lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to omnivorous diets.

Furthermore, switching to a vegetarian or vegan diet can also help reduce animal suffering. Factory farming, the main method of animal agriculture, involves inhumane practices like cramped living conditions, routine mutilations, and cruel slaughter methods. By choosing plant-based options, we can decrease the demand for animal products and support more humane and sustainable farming practices.

Some argue that meat consumption is necessary for protein intake and that plant-based diets lack protein. However, scientific evidence does not support this argument. Many plant-based foods, such as beans, lentils, tofu, and tempeh, are high in protein and can provide all the necessary amino acids for a healthy diet.

In conclusion, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is a crucial step towards a sustainable future. Not only does it reduce the environmental impact of animal agriculture, but it also promotes better health outcomes and reduces animal suffering. While some may argue that meat consumption is necessary for protein intake, the evidence suggests that plant-based diets can provide all the necessary nutrients for a healthy lifestyle. As a high school student, I believe that we have a responsibility to make choices that benefit the planet and its inhabitants, and adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is an excellent way to do so.",1

841,"The debate over whether the electoral college accurately reflects the sentiments of the American people has been ongoing in the United States. It is important to consider the history of its creation, its functioning, and arguments for and against its existence. Evaluating the pros and cons of the electoral college can help determine if it is working as intended. The electoral college was established to prevent tyranny from a direct public vote and aims to represent the collective will rather than majority rule. Critics argue that it disenfranchises some voters, while proponents believe it balances regional interests and prevents polarization. Proposed changes include the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact and abolishing the electoral college in favor of a national popular vote. A potential compromise could involve modifying the electoral college to distribute votes based on popular vote percentages or state size. Ultimately, it is important to continue discussing and evaluating the role of the electoral college in American democracy to ensure it aligns with the nation's values and enhances citizen participation in the electoral process.",1

845,"Everyone encounters challenges in their lives, and it is common to feel overwhelmed by them. However, I believe that problems are not as intimidating as they may appear. As the renowned musician Duke Ellington once said, ""A problem is an opportunity for you to showcase your abilities."" I agree with this statement for several reasons.

To begin with, challenges inspire us to put in more effort. Many successful entrepreneurs have faced numerous obstacles, but they persisted and overcame them. For example, the film ""The Social Network"" depicts Mark Zuckerberg and his team encountering various hurdles while creating Facebook. Despite the setbacks, they continued to work diligently and eventually succeeded in establishing one of the most prosperous social media platforms in history. Problems urge us to strive harder and reach our objectives.

Furthermore, challenges assist us in defining our goals. When we are confronted with difficulties, we are often driven to find a solution and achieve a specific outcome. For instance, when I was a child, I had a vision problem that made reading difficult for me. This issue motivated me to seek assistance, ultimately leading me to get glasses, which improved my vision and enabled me to excel in school. Problems can serve as the driving force that propels us to achieve our aspirations and create a better life for ourselves.

Lastly, challenges enable us to learn from our mistakes. When we face problems, we are compelled to reflect on what went wrong and how we can enhance our approach in the future. For example, when I launched my first business, I made several errors that resulted in its failure. Nevertheless, I gleaned valuable lessons from those mistakes and applied them to my subsequent business endeavor. This experience taught me the significance of learning from my missteps and utilizing them to evolve and prosper.

In conclusion, problems are not inherently negative. They can motivate us to work harder, assist us in defining our goals, and impart valuable insights about ourselves and the world around us. Just as Duke Ellington expressed, ""A problem is an opportunity for you to showcase your abilities."" By embracing challenges and deriving lessons from them, we can become improved versions of ourselves and make a positive impact on the world.",1
846,"Distance learning has become increasingly popular among students, offering flexibility and convenience. However, it may not be suitable for all students.

Students who lack self-motivation or struggle with time management may have difficulty keeping up with assignments. Despite the benefits of learning from anywhere with an internet connection, creating a conducive study environment at home can be a challenge. It is important for students to consider the pros and cons of distance learning before deciding if it is the right choice for them.",1
847,"I do not agree with the principal's decision to make it mandatory for all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurricular activities have many benefits, forcing students to participate takes away their freedom of choice and can overwhelm some students. Not all students have the time or interest to take part in extracurriculars, as some have jobs, family responsibilities, or heavy academic schedules. Forcing these students to join activities could increase their stress levels and affect their performance in other areas. It is unrealistic and unfair to expect every student to add another obligation to their plate.

Extracurricular activities are most valuable and meaningful when students participate because they want to, not because they are required to. Forcing participation may discourage students who are not interested or skilled in the available options. They may reluctantly join an activity just to meet the requirement, rather than finding something they truly enjoy. This could prevent them from fully benefiting from the experience, such as learning time management, developing talents, and having fun.

Instead of making participation mandatory, the school should continue to encourage involvement and showcase the variety of options available so students can discover their own interests. The school could highlight different activities each month and recognize top participants. For students who cannot join an activity due to other commitments, alternative ways to earn credit, like volunteering, could be allowed. This approach allows for student choice while still fostering school spirit and involvement from those who are able to participate.

In conclusion, while extracurricular activities offer many benefits, mandatory participation risks overwhelming students and missing out on the advantages of voluntary engagement. The school should focus on promoting involvement through positive encouragement rather than compulsion. This approach takes into account individual student circumstances and respects their autonomy to participate in ways that are meaningful to them.",1
848,"Social media has become a significant part of our lives, leading to the sharing of a lot of personal information online, from our activities to our whereabouts. This has raised concerns about privacy, with some advocating for stronger protections on social media while others disagree. In my view, I believe that enhanced privacy safeguards are necessary.

Sharing personal information online can pose risks, as hackers and cybercriminals can exploit this data to steal identities or harm individuals. For instance, disclosing one's location on social media could make them vulnerable to attacks. Therefore, it is crucial to implement stronger privacy measures to safeguard personal information.

Furthermore, social media companies often utilize our personal data for their own purposes, such as targeted advertising based on our preferences and behavior online. While this may seem harmless, it infringes on our privacy rights. We should have the ability to regulate how our personal information is used and who has access to it.

Ultimately, privacy is a fundamental human right, and we should have the freedom to choose what we share and with whom, without fear of exploitation. Strengthening privacy protections on social media would provide reassurance that our personal information is secure. In conclusion, I firmly believe that bolstering privacy safeguards on social media is essential to protect individuals from potential threats and uphold their privacy rights.",1

Subject: Importance of Preserving the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for maintaining the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. Despite calls for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College plays a crucial role in upholding the integrity and representation of our nation's highest office.

One key reason for supporting the Electoral College is the certainty it provides in determining the election outcome. Unlike a direct popular vote, the Electoral College ensures that the winning candidate's share of electoral votes typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the results. Additionally, the winner-take-all method prevents ties in the nationwide electoral vote, avoiding potential chaos in the election process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system ensures that the President represents all Americans. With no single region having enough electoral votes to elect a President, candidates must appeal to diverse constituencies across various states. This fosters a sense of representation among residents of different regions and prevents the perception that their votes do not matter.

I also believe that swing states are vital in the Electoral College system. By incentivizing candidates to focus on swing states, the system encourages detailed policy discussions and targeted outreach to voters in those states. This ensures that the most thoughtful voters ultimately decide the election outcome.

Moreover, the Electoral College provides a balance of power between large and small states by giving more weight to larger states based on their population size. This encourages candidates to pay attention to voters in all states and ensures that the President is accountable to the entire nation.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections by ensuring a clear winner in instances where no candidate receives a majority of the votes.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is crucial for maintaining the principles of our democracy. It provides certainty, encourages transregional appeal, promotes engagement in swing states, balances power between large and small states, and eliminates the need for runoff elections. While some may argue for a popular vote system, the Electoral College ensures a more representative outcome that considers the unique characteristics of our nation.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this issue. I hope you will continue to support the Electoral College as an essential part of our democratic process.

Sincerely,

857,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my strong support for eliminating the Electoral College and instead electing the President of the United States based on the popular vote.

The Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that is not suitable for our modern democracy. In the past two decades, there have been five presidential elections where the candidate who won the popular vote did not win the election, which is unacceptable. In a democracy, the candidate with the most votes should be elected.

There are several reasons why the Electoral College is no longer necessary or beneficial. Firstly, it gives too much power to a few states, as candidates need to win a majority of electoral votes by winning certain states. This disproportionately benefits smaller states that are often considered swing states.

Secondly, the Electoral College can lead to candidates focusing their campaigns on a few key states, neglecting the rest of the country. This is unfair to voters in other states and does not represent the majority of the American people.

Lastly, the Electoral College is undemocratic as it allows a candidate to win the presidency without winning the popular vote.

Given the significant changes in the United States since the 18th century when the Electoral College was established, I believe it is time to abolish it and elect the President by popular vote. I urge you to support a constitutional amendment to make this change for the betterment of democracy in our country.

Sincerely,

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to share my thoughts on the Electoral College and discuss the potential benefits of either maintaining the current system or transitioning to a popular vote for electing the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe it is important to consider the impact of this issue on our democracy.

One advantage of the Electoral College is that it ensures a clear outcome and reduces the likelihood of disputes over election results. The winner-take-all approach in most states leads to landslide victories that reflect the majority's preferences. While there have been rare instances where the popular vote winner did not become president, the Electoral College generally aligns with the popular vote.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the idea of a president who represents the entire nation. Requiring candidates to have broad appeal across regions prevents any single area from dominating the election process. This encourages candidates to campaign in various states and consider diverse interests, fostering national unity.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on swing states, where voters are more engaged and informed. This engagement is crucial for a well-informed electorate and a strong democratic system.

The Electoral College also serves as a check against the influence of large states, ensuring that smaller states are not overlooked. By allocating electoral votes based on population, it prevents candidates from solely focusing on populous states and neglecting smaller ones.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, streamlining the election process and maintaining stability in our democracy.

While there are criticisms of the Electoral College, it is essential to consider all perspectives. As a long-standing aspect of our democracy, any potential changes should be carefully evaluated to uphold our democratic principles.

In conclusion, the Electoral College offers benefits such as certainty of outcome, national representation, engagement in swing states, balancing state influence, and avoiding run-off elections. As we continue to discuss the best approach for presidential elections, it is crucial to weigh the advantages of the Electoral College against other proposed systems.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important issue. I trust that you will carefully review both sides of the argument and make a decision that serves the best interests of our democracy.

860,"The debate on how governments should allocate their resources is a contentious one, with some arguing for prioritizing medical care and education over building theaters and sports stadiums, while others believe both are important and should be funded. In my view, governments should prioritize medical care and education as they are essential for citizen well-being. Access to quality medical care is a basic human right, and education is crucial for national development and creating a more equitable society. Theaters and sports stadiums, on the other hand, are not essential and can be considered luxuries. They are costly to build and maintain, and the money could be better spent on more urgent needs.

863,"The debate over whether summer projects for students should be designed by teachers or students themselves is a topic that warrants consideration from both perspectives. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages.

Giving students the freedom to design their own summer projects allows for creativity, choice, and independence. When students are able to choose a topic that interests them, they are more likely to be motivated to delve deeper into it and learn in a way that is meaningful to them. This can help develop important skills such as self-directed learning, time management, and independent research, which are valuable beyond the classroom. Student-designed projects also cater to different learning styles and offer flexibility during a break period.

On the other hand, teacher-designed projects ensure consistency in curriculum objectives and standards across grade levels. Educators can design assignments that reinforce key concepts and content from the previous academic year, helping to review and consolidate prior learning and prevent summer learning loss. Teacher guidance can also provide the necessary support to challenge students appropriately for their grade level. Well-planned teacher projects can encourage inquiry-based learning on topics that may be outside a student's natural interests while still introducing new perspectives and knowledge.

In conclusion, a balanced combination of both teacher and student input is likely the most effective approach. Allowing students some choice in their projects can motivate independent work, while teacher guidance on core learning goals maintains educational rigor. Effective communication between educators and students is crucial in finding the right balance between open-ended exploration and curriculum-linked objectives.

864,"Dear Principal,

I am writing to express my thoughts on the school's cell phone policy. I believe that the school should implement policy 1, which permits students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

Firstly, having a cell phone is crucial for emergencies. In the event of an emergency, such as a student getting injured or a family emergency, students can quickly reach out to their parents or emergency services. This can help ensure that students stay safe and receive the necessary help promptly.

Secondly, many students depend on their phones for communication. For instance, some students may need to contact their parents to arrange for a ride home or inform them that they will be late. Additionally, some students may need to communicate with their teachers or classmates about schoolwork or projects. Allowing students to use their phones during lunch periods and other free times can facilitate this communication.

Lastly, having a cell phone can foster responsibility and trust. If students are permitted to have phones at school, they will be responsible for keeping them secure and refraining from using them during class time. This can help establish trust between students and teachers, as it demonstrates that students are capable of adhering to rules and being responsible.

I acknowledge that some individuals may argue that cell phones can be a distraction during class time. However, policy 1 addresses this concern by mandating that students turn off their phones during class time. This ensures that students are not distracted by their phones and can concentrate on their studies.

In conclusion, I believe that policy 1 is the best choice for our school's cell phone policy. It allows students to have access to their phones for emergencies and communication, while also promoting responsibility and trust. Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter.

I am writing to express my support for maintaining the Electoral College. I understand that this is a contentious issue, but I believe that the Electoral College is the most effective way to ensure that the President of the United States is elected by a majority of Americans.

Here are some of the reasons why I back the Electoral College:

- The Electoral College prevents a tyranny of the majority. If the President were elected by popular vote, candidates who won the most votes in the largest states would always win, even if they did not have the support of the majority of Americans. This would marginalize voters in smaller states, which is unjust.
- The Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in all 50 states. If the President were elected by popular vote, candidates would only focus on states with the largest populations, leaving voters in smaller states feeling neglected.
- The Electoral College has a long history in the United States, being used since 1789. It is a part of our nation's heritage and should be preserved.

While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and advocate for a popular vote system, I believe that it remains the best way to ensure that the President is elected by a majority of Americans.

869,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a cutting-edge technology that allows computers to identify and comprehend human emotions. As this technology progresses, there is a suggestion to utilize FACS in educational settings to improve students' learning experiences. However, this proposal elicits both enthusiasm and apprehension.

On one hand, FACS has the potential to transform education by offering personalized learning opportunities for students. With FACS, computers can detect students' emotions like confusion or boredom and adjust teaching methods in real-time to keep them engaged. This could create a more interactive and efficient learning environment where students can learn at their own pace and teachers can customize their teaching approaches to meet individual needs.

On the other hand, implementing FACS in classrooms raises significant concerns. One major worry is privacy, as the technology could potentially intrude on students' personal privacy by monitoring their emotional states without consent. This could result in a stressful learning atmosphere where students feel constantly observed and evaluated. Additionally, FACS may struggle to comprehend the root causes of students' emotions, leading to misinterpretation and misdiagnosis.

Another concern is the practicality of integrating FACS in classrooms. The technology requires a substantial financial investment, which may not be feasible for many educational institutions. Furthermore, the logistics of implementing FACS in group settings are uncertain, such as how the technology would adjust teaching methods in real-time without disrupting other students' learning processes. These practical concerns raise doubts about the viability of FACS in classrooms.

Furthermore, the use of FACS in education could foster an excessive reliance on technology. While technology has its advantages, it is crucial to remember the importance of human connection and emotional understanding in education. Teachers have the ability to intuitively assess students' emotions and respond appropriately, which is a fundamental aspect of teaching. The use of FACS may diminish this human connection and replace it with a more artificial and impersonal learning environment.

In conclusion, while the potential benefits of FACS in education are promising, the concerns regarding privacy, practicality, and human connection must not be overlooked. It is essential to approach the integration of technology in education cautiously and with respect for privacy. Instead of solely depending on technology, we should embrace teaching methods that prioritize emotional understanding and human connection. As we progress in the technological age, it is vital to remember the value of human interaction in education.",1

By studying these actions, researchers can gain insight into the mechanics of emotions and their display on the face. FACS is beneficial in psychology, filmmaking, and animation, aiding in the creation of realistic and expressive characters. It also helps in identifying emotions in individuals who struggle to communicate verbally, like those with autism. Overall, FACS is a valuable tool for understanding and categorizing human facial expressions, enabling a deeper exploration of emotions and their portrayal on the face.",1
871,"Dear State Senator,

I am writing to share my views on the Electoral College system and its significance in the Presidential election process. While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and unjust, I firmly believe that it plays a vital role in our democratic system and should be preserved.

To begin with, the Electoral College ensures fairness and representation for smaller states, as candidates would otherwise only focus on densely populated areas, disregarding the needs of smaller states. The winner-take-all system in most states guarantees that a candidate who wins a state receives all of its electoral votes, giving smaller states a say in the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College prevents a candidate from winning the presidency without winning the majority of the popular vote, as seen in the 2000 election between Al Gore and George W. Bush. It requires a candidate to have broad support across the country, rather than just in a few heavily populated areas.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign nationwide, rather than just in swing states, leading to a more informed electorate. This results in voters in tossup states paying closer attention to the campaign and considering the candidates' stances on issues.

Lastly, the Electoral College ensures that the entire country has a voice in the election, not just the most populous areas. The winner must receive a minimum number of votes from each state, promoting a candidate with broad support across the nation, rather than just in heavily populated regions.",1
872,"School shootings have become a major topic of conversation in the United States, with significant effects on children and adolescents who are often left feeling scared, sad, and confused. The main psychological impact is an increased sense of fear among students, leading to symptoms of PTSD like trouble sleeping and concentrating, restlessness, and nightmares. These traumatic events can also hinder cognitive development and academic performance, potentially causing long-term issues with coping and mental health. The aftermath of school shootings will likely result in heightened security measures and gun control laws, as well as a focus on healing those affected by the violence. Schools need to take proactive measures to create safe and supportive learning environments, which may involve investing in counseling services, hiring more staff for safety, and improving communication with families.",1
873,"Hello! I am a scientist from NASA and I am thrilled to share some information about the Face on Mars with you. Despite rumors of it being a sign of alien life, I want to clarify that it is actually a natural landform. The Face on Mars is similar to buttes and mesas found on Earth, as confirmed by high-resolution images taken by NASA's Mars Global Surveyor in 1997. Its location at a potential ancient Martian ocean boundary suggests that it was formed by geological processes, not alien intervention. Additionally, the Face has been observed for decades and its appearance has changed over time, indicating that it is a natural feature. In conclusion, the Face on Mars is a fascinating example of the planet's natural wonders, formed by geological processes and not by aliens. Thank you for listening!",1
874,"I'm really excited to be writing this essay about the significance of first impressions. First impressions are crucial and difficult to change, which is fascinating. Have you ever met someone who seemed amazing at first but turned out to be unpleasant? Our brains are wired to quickly form judgments based on initial interactions, making it challenging to alter those perceptions. It's a natural process as our minds categorize and store information, including first impressions. People often don't anticipate the impact of first impressions, leading to surprises when someone's true nature is revealed. Despite the difficulty of changing initial impressions, it adds an element of unpredictability to life.

876,"I predict that in twenty years, there will be a decrease in the number of cars being used compared to today. This is due to the rising popularity of alternative transportation options such as bicycles and public transportation. Additionally, the increasing demand for electric vehicles, which are more environmentally friendly and cost-effective to operate, is also a contributing factor. The growth of the sharing economy, exemplified by ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, is further reducing the need for individual car ownership. I anticipate that this trend will persist and expand in the years to come.",1
877,"As a sixth-grade student, I believe that disposable plastics should be prohibited. Items like plastic bags, straws, and water bottles are used once and then discarded, often causing harm to marine life in our oceans. One of the main reasons I advocate for a ban on disposable plastics is the environmental damage they cause. Plastic bags and straws can harm sea turtles and other animals by choking or suffocating them when mistaken for food. Plastic water bottles can leak harmful chemicals into the ocean, polluting the water and endangering marine animals. By prohibiting disposable plastics, we can help protect the environment and keep our oceans clean.

Another reason I support a ban on disposable plastics is their unnecessary nature. Reusable alternatives like cloth bags, metal straws, and refillable water bottles are more durable and cost-effective. For instance, a cloth bag can be used multiple times, while a plastic bag is used once and then thrown away. By opting for reusable alternatives, we can decrease the amount of waste in our landfills and oceans.

Moreover, banning disposable plastics can also aid in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The production of plastics requires a significant amount of energy, often derived from burning fossil fuels and emitting greenhouse gases. By decreasing the demand for disposable plastics, we can lower the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere, contributing to the fight against climate change.

While some may argue that banning disposable plastics would inconvenience consumers, I believe that the benefits of a ban outweigh any inconvenience. Many businesses and cities have already implemented bans on disposable plastics, and people have adjusted by using reusable alternatives. In fact, many individuals have found that using reusable alternatives is more convenient than constantly purchasing new disposable plastics.

In conclusion, banning disposable plastics is crucial to protecting the environment and reducing waste. By embracing reusable alternatives, we can minimize the plastic pollution in our oceans and landfills, as well as help combat climate change. I encourage everyone to support a ban on disposable plastics and make a positive impact on the environment.",1
878,"Hello there!

Choosing between an active lifestyle and a lazy lifestyle, huh? Well, let me explain, these two ways of living are quite different.

Living an active life involves being energetic and engaging in physical activities like sports, going to the gym, and hiking. On the other hand, living a lazy life means being laid back and not doing much, such as watching TV, playing video games, and sleeping in.

Starting with the benefits of an active life, one of the main advantages is staying healthy and fit. You'll have more energy, be stronger, and have fun participating in various activities. However, living a lazy life also has its advantages, like being able to relax and take it easy without the pressure of working out.

Both lifestyles have their drawbacks as well. An active life can be exhausting, while a lazy life may lead to feelings of guilt for not being productive.

879,"As the cost of education rises, more students are taking on significant debt to pursue their academic interests. It is crucial for educational institutions to guide students towards fields where they are likely to succeed, rather than allowing them to pursue areas where success is unlikely. While some may argue for students' right to choose any field, I believe institutions have a duty to discourage students from pursuing paths where success is improbable.

It is not beneficial for students to pursue fields where success is unlikely, as it can lead to frustration, disappointment, and financial struggles. Additionally, students who are not well-suited for certain fields may be taking spots that could be better filled by more qualified candidates, potentially leading to a shortage of skilled workers in critical areas. Educational institutions also have a responsibility to ensure that graduates are competitive in the job market, and encouraging students to pursue fields where they are likely to excel can help prevent graduates from facing unemployment or underemployment.

In conclusion, while students have the freedom to choose their field of study, educational institutions should play a role in guiding them towards areas where they are likely to succeed. This approach benefits students, the economy, and society as a whole by ensuring that graduates are well-prepared for the workforce and can make meaningful contributions.",1
880,"Zoos have long been a source of entertainment and education for Manx individuals, but their role in conservation and education has come under scrutiny. While some believe that zoos are crucial for protecting endangered species and educating the public about wildlife, others argue that they are unethical and do more harm than good. In this essay, I will argue against the ongoing operation of zoos, providing reasons and examples to support my stance.

To begin with, zoos are not an effective form of conservation. While they may offer a safe environment for certain species, they cannot replace natural habitats. Animals in zoos are often taken from their natural surroundings and placed in small enclosures, leading to stress, behavioral issues, and health problems. For instance, a study by the Born Free Foundation revealed that zoos fail to provide adequate space and stimulation for lions, resulting in abnormal behaviors like pacing and self-harm.

Moreover, zoos can reinforce the idea that animals are objects for human entertainment. By showcasing animals in cages, zoos perpetuate the belief that animals exist solely for human amusement. This can lead to a lack of respect for animals and their habitats, as well as the propagation of harmful stereotypes. For example, displaying animals in unnatural settings can distort the public's understanding of these creatures in the wild.

Additionally, zoos can be detrimental to animal welfare. Inbreeding in zoos can lead to genetic defects and a decline in population diversity. Research by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria found that a significant number of European zoos struggle with inbreeding issues, resulting in genetic homogeneity among Manx species.

Lastly, there are alternative methods for learning about and protecting wildlife that do not involve zoos. Wildlife documentaries, conservation parks, and rehabilitation centers offer effective ways to educate the public about wildlife while fostering a respectful relationship between humans and animals. For example, conservation parks like the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya provide a natural environment for animals to thrive while allowing visitors to observe and learn about wildlife.

In conclusion, while zoos have traditionally served as sources of entertainment and education for Manx people, they are not effective in conservation efforts and can perpetuate harmful stereotypes about animals. By subjecting animals to unnatural environments and inbreeding, zoos can cause harm to animal populations. It is essential to explore alternative conservation and education methods that prioritize respect and nonexploitative relationships between humans and animals. Therefore, I contend that the continued operation of zoos is unjustified, and we should focus on alternative approaches to wildlife conservation and education.",1
881,""" by John Doe, states that ""The implementation of car-free days in cities like Bogotá has led to a significant decrease in traffic congestion."" (Doe 2019) This demonstrates how limiting car usage can lead to smoother traffic flow and improved mobility for all road users.

Lastly, limiting car usage can contribute to a more sustainable environment. According to the passage from ""Sustainable Cities,"" by Jane Smith, ""Reducing car dependence is essential for creating a more sustainable urban environment."" (Smith 2018) This emphasizes the importance of promoting alternative modes of transportation to reduce the environmental impact of car emissions. By encouraging walking, cycling, and public transport, cities can reduce their carbon footprint and create a more sustainable future for all. For instance, the passage from ""The Benefits of Carpooling,"" by Sarah Johnson, states that ""Carpooling can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote a more sustainable transportation system."" (Johnson 2017) This highlights how individual actions, such as carpooling, can contribute to a more sustainable environment overall.",1
882,"The topic of legalizing marijuana has been widely discussed for some time now. There are differing opinions on whether it is a good idea or not. Personally, I believe that legalizing marijuana is a positive step.

To begin with, marijuana is not as harmful as other drugs like cocaine or heroin. Research has shown that it can have beneficial effects on the body, particularly for those suffering from illnesses such as cancer or HIV/AIDS, as well as for individuals with anxiety or depression.

Furthermore, legalizing marijuana could generate revenue for the government, which could be used to support important institutions like schools and hospitals, thus benefiting the economy.

Additionally, legalizing marijuana could potentially reduce crime by eliminating the need for individuals to purchase it from illegal sources, thereby diminishing the power and influence of criminals.

Lastly, it is unjust to penalize individuals for using marijuana when alcohol, which can be more harmful, is legal. Therefore, I believe that marijuana should be legalized as it has numerous potential benefits.

While there may be concerns about the impact of legalization, I believe that with responsible regulation, the overall effect on society could be positive. In conclusion, I advocate for the serious consideration of legalizing marijuana.",1
883,"The Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, is a method developed by Dr. Paul Ekman for analyzing and categorizing human facial expressions by breaking them down into distinct movements.

FACS is widely used in psychology, film and television production, and forensic science to understand human emotions, create realistic facial expressions, and detect deception in suspect interviews. Overall, FACS has revolutionized our understanding of human facial expressions and is a valuable tool in various fields.",1
884,"I do not agree with the Principal's decision to make participation in at least one extracurricular activity mandatory for all students. While extracurricular activities have many advantages, requiring participation infringes on student freedom and can discourage learning for the sake of learning.

Forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities disregards their individual preferences and circumstances. Not all students enjoy traditional extracurricular options like sports, student government, or publications. By mandating participation, students are unable to pursue activities that they find more engaging, such as hobbies, part-time jobs, or tutoring. This requirement also fails to take into account responsibilities like caring for family members or managing health issues. Learning is most effective when students are able to freely pursue their interests and strengths.

Mandatory participation in extracurricular activities could diminish the purpose of these activities. When participation is compulsory rather than voluntary, it loses its value as an opportunity for leadership, exploration, and personal enrichment. Students may see required activities as a burden rather than a chance to develop new skills. This negative attitude could also affect their academic studies if all learning feels obligatory rather than self-motivated.

Encouraging students to participate in extracurricular activities is more effective than making it a requirement. While the Principal's intention to engage students is commendable, a mandate is not necessary to achieve this goal. By promoting the benefits of various extracurricular activities and helping students find options that align with their passions, participation can be increased in a more authentic way. Students should be empowered to shape their own education, rather than being controlled by it. In conclusion, while extracurricular activities offer many benefits, learning is most successful when approached willingly rather than through coercion. Therefore, the Principal's proposed mandate should not be supported or implemented.",1

In basketball, this could mean missing a defensive assignment; in baseball, it could mean striking out in a crucial moment. Each mistake can help athletes understand what works and what doesn't, gradually enhancing their chances of success.

The same principle applies to everyday life. Those who avoid taking risks and making mistakes will struggle to learn and develop as individuals. Conversely, those who are willing to make mistakes and learn from them will become stronger and more successful. For instance, someone looking to improve their cooking skills may need to make a few mistakes before mastering their dishes. Similarly, someone aiming to enhance their public speaking abilities may need to make errors during their initial speeches.

While making mistakes can be intimidating, they can also bring unexpected benefits. Instead of being disheartened by mistakes, they should be embraced as opportunities for growth. Each mistake presents a chance to improve and ultimately achieve success in life.",1
893,"Introduction:

As a scientist at NASA, I have always been intrigued by the mysteries of the universe, particularly the ""Face on Mars"" in Cydonia. While some believe this structure was created by extraterrestrial beings, I will argue that it is a natural landform. In this essay, I will use evidence from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" to support my argument and clarify any misconceptions about the origin of the Face.

Body:

Claim 1: The Face on Mars is a natural landform, similar to Earth's buttes or mesas.

According to the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" the Face is a natural landform, similar to Earth's buttes or mesas.

897,"I believe that dress codes are advantageous for the school setting. One reason is that they assist students in concentrating on their academics rather than their attire. When students all wear similar clothing, they are less likely to be distracted by what others are wearing. For instance, if everyone wears the same color shirt, students will not be preoccupied with who has the trendiest shirt or who is dressed oddly.

Another benefit of dress codes is that they can help prevent bullying. When students wear the same type of clothes, they are not judged based on their attire. Sometimes, students who dress differently are teased, leading to feelings of sadness or exclusion. If everyone dresses alike, no one will feel left out or be bullied because of their clothing.

Dress codes also teach students how to dress appropriately for various occasions. For example, if a student has a job interview, they will need to dress formally. If they have been following a dress code at school, they will know how to dress suitably for the interview.

Lastly, dress codes foster a sense of unity among students. When everyone wears the same clothes, they feel like they belong to the same group. This can enhance school spirit and make students feel more connected to their school.

In conclusion, dress codes can be beneficial for the school environment.

898,"Hey there! So, I guess you're here to read my essay about why it's beneficial to seek multiple opinions and advice. Like, obviously, right? Who wouldn't want to get different perspectives on things? It's much better than just relying on one person and feeling like they didn't help at all.

Let's discuss why asking more than one person is great. If you ask one person, you'll get one opinion, but if you ask five people, you'll receive five different opinions. Some of them may even be completely different from each other! It's like getting a variety of viewpoints all at once. Additionally, it's really helpful!

It's not just about getting diverse opinions, though. When you ask multiple people, you can also benefit from their different areas of expertise. For example, your knowledgeable teacher might provide a great answer, but your cool older brother could offer a unique perspective based on his own experiences. They might have different areas of expertise to share.

However, there are also some drawbacks to seeking advice from multiple people. Sometimes, you may receive conflicting advice and feel unsure about what to do next. Or, some people may not be reliable sources of information, leaving you feeling frustrated. But if you ask enough people, you can usually figure out the best course of action.

Here's an example of a time when I sought help from more than one person. Last year, my family and I were planning a trip to the beach and couldn't decide where to stay. My mom preferred a fancy resort, while my dad wanted to stay at a campground. I was unsure about what to choose, so I asked my sister and friend for their opinions. They both offered different perspectives - my sister recommended the resort for its fun activities, while my friend suggested something else.",1
899,"In today's digital era, there is a debate surrounding the relevance of libraries. Some argue that with the abundance of online information, libraries are no longer necessary. However, I believe that libraries still hold significance for various reasons.

900,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to advocate for replacing the Electoral College system with a popular vote system for electing the president. While the Electoral College was intended to give smaller states more influence, I believe that a popular vote would better represent the will of the people.

Some argue that the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in more states, but research shows that they focus on swing states, neglecting the majority of states. A popular vote would require candidates to campaign nationwide and appeal to a broader range of voters, making every citizen's vote equally important.

While some argue that smaller states would lose influence without the Electoral College, I believe that every vote should have equal weight regardless of where someone lives. A national popular vote would align better with the principle of one person, one vote.

A majority of Americans support electing the president by popular vote, indicating a desire for reform. This change could increase trust in the electoral system and ensure that the candidate with the most votes nationwide becomes president. Therefore, I believe transitioning to a popular vote system would strengthen our democracy and promote equality. Thank you for your consideration.

One key benefit of the Electoral College is the clear outcome it provides. According to Judge Richard A. Poster, the winning candidate usually receives a higher share of Electoral College votes than the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of disputes and legal battles.

Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that every region has a voice in electing the President. By requiring candidates to have broad appeal, it prevents candidates with only regional support from neglecting the interests of other areas.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus on swing states and address the concerns of these voters. This leads to a more engaged electorate and a president who is responsive to a wide range of Americans.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of large and small states, ensuring that all states are considered in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections, providing stability and efficiency in the election process.

Despite criticisms, I believe that the practical benefits of the Electoral College outweigh the drawbacks. It upholds our federal system, ensures that all regions are represented, and promotes stability in presidential elections.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue. I hope that you will support keeping the Electoral College as part of our democratic process. Please reach out if you would like to discuss this further.

Sincerely,

Social changes can have a more significant and lasting impact on people's lives than political events. While political events can alter a nation's history, social changes affect daily interactions between individuals. These changes can range from shifts in attitudes towards marginalized groups to the rise of new social movements, with effects felt for years and generations.

For instance, the civil rights movement in the 1960s led to political changes like anti-discrimination laws in the US, but also brought about social acceptance and pride for African Americans. This social transformation had a global impact, inspiring similar movements worldwide.

Furthermore, social transformations often precede political change, as laws and policies reflect shifts in societal attitudes. For example, the legalization of same-sex marriage resulted from a social movement challenging traditional gender and sexuality norms, paving the way for political recognition and protection of LGBTQ+ rights.

Lastly, grassroots movements driven by ordinary people, like the Me Too movement, can bring about genuine and lasting change in society. These movements reflect the needs and aspirations of the wider society, unlike political events driven by powerful elites.

918,"Dear principal,

I am a ninth-grade student writing to express my concerns about the proposed policy that only allows students with a grade B or better average to participate in sports and other activities. While I understand the importance of focusing on our studies, I believe this policy is unjust as it may discourage many students.

To begin with, not all students excel in every subject. It is unfair to penalize a student who excels in sports or other activities based on their grades in subjects that may not be their strengths.

940,"Title: Investigating Venus

Venus, the second planet in our solar system, is often called Earth's ""sister planet"" because of their similar sizes and compositions. Despite their similarities, Venus and Earth have vastly different conditions. While Earth supports diverse ecosystems, Venus is a hot, dry, toxic environment where life cannot exist. Scientists are studying Venus to uncover its secrets and understand why it is so different from Earth.

Venus's atmosphere is mainly carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen and sulfur dioxide, creating a dense atmosphere that exerts 90 times the pressure of Earth's atmosphere. This thick atmosphere traps heat from the Sun, resulting in surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. The high pressure and extreme temperatures create a toxic cloud layer that obscures the planet's surface.

Scientists have explored Venus from orbit using spacecraft, with missions conducted by the former Soviet Union and the United States providing valuable data and images. While there are currently no active missions to Venus, researchers are eager to further explore the planet to understand its atmosphere, evolution, and potential for life. The possibility of past or present life on Venus is being investigated, with evidence of phosphine gas potentially indicating biological activity.

944,"The ongoing debate about whether young people enjoy life more than older people is a longstanding one, with the answer varying from person to person. While it is commonly believed that young individuals have more energy and fewer obligations compared to older individuals, this does not automatically equate to a higher level of enjoyment in life. In reality, older individuals may actually find more enjoyment in life due to their accumulated life experiences and wisdom.

One of the primary reasons why older individuals may find more enjoyment in life is because they have had more opportunities to explore and cultivate their interests over time. For instance, an older person may have traveled extensively, tried various cuisines, and learned about different cultures, leading to a deeper appreciation for life. Conversely, younger individuals may not have had the same chances to gain life experiences and explore the world.

Furthermore, older individuals often possess more wisdom than their younger counterparts, which can help them better appreciate life and handle challenges more effectively. Having learned from past mistakes and developed a greater understanding of life, older individuals may experience a greater sense of contentment and fulfillment. On the other hand, younger individuals may still be in the process of learning from their mistakes and navigating life's obstacles.

Lastly, older individuals may enjoy life more than younger individuals because they have fewer responsibilities. With retirement, mortgage payments completed, and children grown, older individuals may have more freedom to focus on activities that bring them joy. In contrast, younger individuals may still be juggling the demands of work, school, and family life.

In conclusion, while young people may have more energy and fewer responsibilities than older individuals, this does not necessarily mean they enjoy life more. Older individuals may actually find more enjoyment in life due to their wealth of life experiences, wisdom, and fewer responsibilities.",1

949,"Failure: The Key to Success?

As an eighth grader, I've come to understand that failure is not the end of the road, but rather a necessary step towards achieving success. Many accomplished individuals have faced setbacks in their lives, but instead of letting failure hold them back, they learned from their mistakes and persevered.

Take scientists, for example. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, famously said, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" Despite numerous failures, he continued to experiment until he found the right solution.

Students can also benefit from failure. When I received a C on a math test in seventh grade, I was disappointed. However, with encouragement from my teacher, I worked harder and eventually earned an A on the next test. If I had given up after the first test, I would not have achieved my goal.

Entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs, who was fired from the company he founded, understand the importance of failure in achieving success. Jobs went on to create groundbreaking products like the iPhone and iPad despite setbacks.

Social media has also played a role in success stories. Many individuals use platforms like Instagram and YouTube to showcase their talents and build a following. While some may initially struggle to gain popularity, persistence often leads to success. For example, ""The Try Guys"" YouTube channel started small but grew to millions of subscribers through consistent content creation.

While some achieve success quickly without much failure, like J.K. Rowling with the Harry Potter series, it is clear that failure can be a valuable learning experience on the path to success.

953,"The Electoral College (EC) is a group of electors chosen by each state to determine the President of the United States. It was created as a compromise between election by Congress and popular vote. Supporters argue that it ensures small states have a voice, while opponents claim it distorts the majority's will. This essay will discuss the benefits of the electoral college system.

The EC provides equal representation for each state by giving them electors based on their congressional representation. This ensures smaller states have a say in the election process.

Furthermore, the EC prevents a candidate from winning solely based on support from a few large states. Candidates must win states across the country to secure the presidency, ensuring they have broad support.

Critics argue the EC can distort the majority's will, but winning the popular vote alone is not enough to secure the presidency. Candidates must also win enough electoral votes, encouraging them to appeal to voters in various states.

960,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a comprehensive academic framework developed in 1978 by psychologist Paul Ekman and anatomist Wallace V. Friesen at the University of California, San Francisco. It consists of 46 distinct facial ""action units"" that depict the wide range of facial expressions humans can make. FACS is not just a catalog of common facial expressions; it aims to identify the physical ""bases"" of emotions and cognitive experiences, aiding in understanding the universality of human facial expressions and their underlying meanings. By examining these action units individually or in combination, researchers can gain insight into the complex emotions and thoughts behind displayed facial expressions.

FACS categorizes facial expressions into seven groups, which can be combined to form more complex emotions and expressions. These categories include actions like raising the inner or outer eyebrows, configuring the eyelids, raising or pressing the lips, and opening the lips to show teeth. The 46 action units allow researchers to pinpoint specific expressions, intensity, and movement direction, helping to discern unique differences in facial expressions across cultures. This standardized framework facilitates intercultural understanding and communication, as different societies may demonstrate the same emotions through different facial movements.

The use of FACS has provided significant insights and benefits across various disciplines. In psychology and social science, it has deepened our understanding of communication patterns, leading to the development of better models and theories. In sociology and anthropology, FACS has advanced our knowledge of how facial expressions and gestures influence social behavior and cultural differences. In linguistics, FACS has contributed to the study of communication and the relationship between body language and language use, aiding in interpreting subtle meanings conveyed through nonverbal cues.

Furthermore, FACS has practical applications in the legal system, assisting in criminal investigations and profiling by identifying emotional responses and potential deception through facial movements. It has also been crucial in developing more accurate lie detectors to evaluate witness testimonies. Overall, FACS is widely used for research purposes due to its robust framework and adaptability to various disciplines, promoting mutual understanding and enriching global societies through the study of facial expressions.",1

I will also explore why the Board of Teachers at a private school believes it is advantageous to commit to a career at a young age and provide examples of successful students who have done so to support my arguments.

On one hand, committing to a career early can help individuals focus on their goals and work towards achieving them, leading to a better understanding of what it takes to succeed in their chosen field. It can also give them a sense of purpose and direction in life, motivating them to work harder and reach their goals.

However, committing to a career at a young age can also limit options and opportunities, preventing individuals from exploring other interests or career paths. This can result in a lack of fulfillment or satisfaction in their chosen career and may lead to burnout or stress from the pressure to achieve goals quickly.

The influence of parents and society on this decision is significant, as parents often shape their children's career choices and societal norms can impact career decisions. Certain careers may be viewed as more prestigious or desirable in some cultures, influencing individuals' choices. Additionally, societal expectations for financial stability or job security can also play a role in career decisions.

In conclusion, while committing to a career at a young age has its advantages and disadvantages, it is important to consider the influences of parents and society on this decision. By weighing these factors carefully, individuals can make informed choices about their career paths.",1
973,"In recent years, online classes and traditional classroom-based education have become increasingly popular, with many students choosing the flexibility and convenience of online learning. While each type of learning environment has its own pros and cons, it is crucial to compare and contrast them in terms of student academic performance, engagement levels, and potential for early graduation.

Research has shown that students in online classes typically perform just as well academically as those in traditional classrooms, often due to the individualized attention and support provided by online instructors. The ability to work at their own pace can also benefit students who struggle in traditional settings.

However, online classes may present challenges in terms of academic achievement, such as a lack of structure and accountability that some students may find difficult to navigate. Motivation and engagement can also be issues for students without a strong support system.

In terms of engagement levels, traditional classrooms offer more opportunities for social interaction and collaboration, which can be advantageous for students who thrive in group settings. The sense of community and belonging provided by traditional education is especially important for students new to a school or community.

On the other hand, traditional classrooms may not be the best fit for all students, particularly those who are introverted or struggle with group work. The structured nature of traditional education can also be limiting for students who prefer more flexible learning environments.

Both online classes and traditional education can lead to early graduation if students are able to complete their coursework efficiently. Online classes, however, offer more flexibility and control over schedules, benefiting students who work well independently.

In conclusion, both online classes and traditional education have their own strengths and weaknesses. It is essential for students to carefully consider their individual needs and learning styles when choosing between the two options.",1

Subject: Support for the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College as a crucial component of the presidential election process. While some argue for a popular vote system, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College is essential for ensuring fairness, regional representation, and political stability in our elections.

Established as a compromise by our founding fathers, the Electoral College consists of 538 electors who play a vital role in selecting the President and Vice President. This system ensures a balanced approach to electing the President and offers certainty of outcome, national representation, balance between big and small states, and eliminates the need for runoff elections.

I urge you to consider the benefits of the Electoral College and advocate for its retention. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

975,"The debate surrounding the legalization of marijuana has been ongoing, with some advocating for its legalization while others argue it should remain illegal. Personally, I am in favor of legalizing marijuana. Firstly, marijuana has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries and has been shown to have various health benefits. Legalizing it would provide patients with a safer and more effective treatment option. Additionally, criminalizing marijuana has resulted in significant resources being spent on enforcement and imprisonment, with a large portion of drug arrests being related to marijuana possession. Legalization would allow law enforcement to focus on more serious crimes and save taxpayers money. Furthermore, legalizing marijuana would create a regulated industry that generates revenue and jobs, as seen in states like Colorado and Washington. Studies have also shown that legalizing marijuana does not lead to an increase in drug use, with some even showing a decrease in use among teenagers in states where it is legal. Overall, I believe that the benefits of legalizing marijuana outweigh the drawbacks and hope to see it legalized nationwide in the future.",1

Supporters argue that it provides fair representation for all states, while critics claim it favors certain swing states and can lead to negative campaigning. Ultimately, the system may require significant changes to truly reflect the will of the people nationwide. Efforts to reform or abolish the electoral college will be necessary to ensure a more effective system in the modern era.",1
977,"Dear Ms. Smith,

I believe that Policy 1 is the better option for us, the students. Many times, we need to communicate with our parents or guardians while at school, especially in emergencies or to convey important information. Additionally, during lunch, having access to games or videos on our phones can help pass the time more quickly. It would also be beneficial for us to practice being responsible and mature with our phones.

Furthermore, not allowing phones at school could lead to boredom and difficulty focusing in class. There is also the risk of cheating on tests if students are unable to use their phones and have to rely solely on their memories. Having phones can also be crucial in case of emergencies, such as fires, where teachers may need to contact our parents.

I believe that students should have the freedom to choose how to spend their free time and should be allowed to have their phones. I hope you will consider Policy 1.

Thank you for considering my opinion.

Sincerely,

980,"The Importance of Preserving the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator’s Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in the United States presidential election. While some argue for a switch to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial safeguard that ensures fair representation and prevents potential chaos that could arise from a direct popular vote.

The Electoral College system was established as a compromise between election by Congress and a popular vote. According to the Office of the Federal Register, this process allows for the election of electors who then vote for the President and Vice President, with the final count of electoral votes done by Congress. With 538 electors, at least 270 electoral votes are needed to elect the President. This system ensures that each state has a say in the election outcome, as the number of electors is based on the state’s congressional delegation, providing representation for both populous and less populated states.

One of the main benefits of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. In a direct popular vote, disputes over close margins could lead to legal battles and uncertainty. However, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes ensures that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College always exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the potential for disputed results. This stability is crucial for maintaining public confidence in the election process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the idea of a president for everyone by requiring candidates to have appeal across regions. No single region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president, encouraging candidates to campaign nationwide and address the needs of diverse regions. This ensures that the elected president has a broad understanding of the nation’s interests and does not cater to just one region.

Additionally, the focus on swing states by the Electoral College leads to more engaged and thoughtful voters. Swing states receive more attention from candidates, prompting voters to pay closer attention to campaign messages and make well-informed decisions. This allows states with various political perspectives to influence the election outcome.

In addressing concerns about large states dominating the election process, the Electoral College helps balance political weight between large and small states. It gives large states greater influence while preventing any region from being overly powerful. The electoral votes are proportionate to each state’s population, ensuring that candidates consider both large and small states during their campaigns.

Lastly, the Electoral College method avoids runoff elections that could complicate and prolong the presidential election process. It eliminates the need for additional votes or runoffs when no candidate secures an absolute majority, promoting continuity and efficiency in determining the president-elect.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in noncompetitive states, statistics show that approximately half of eligible Americans still participate in presidential elections. Voters are motivated by a desire to express their political preferences rather than the belief that their single vote will sway the entire election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College stands as a vital component of our democratic process. It ensures that every state has a voice in electing the President, promotes regional appeal, encourages thoughtful voting, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids potential runoff elections. The Electoral College is a tried-and-tested system that has provided stability and fairness to the presidential election process for over two centuries.

Therefore, I urge you to consider the importance of retaining the Electoral College and to vote in favor of maintaining this crucial institution.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

983,"There is no definitive answer to this question, as it varies depending on the individual and their specific circumstances. However, in general, I think that living off campus can be a beneficial experience for college students.

One advantage of living off campus is that it can be more cost-effective compared to on-campus housing, especially if the student can find roommates to share an apartment with. Additionally, off-campus apartments are often situated in convenient locations near restaurants, shops, and other amenities, which can be advantageous for students without cars who rely on public transportation.

Another benefit of living off campus is that it can offer students more privacy and independence, which can be particularly beneficial for those attending college far from home or seeking a more mature living experience.

However, there are potential drawbacks to living off campus, such as challenges in making friends and limited weekend activities for students without cars.

In conclusion, I believe that living off campus can be a positive experience for college students, allowing them to save money, enjoy a convenient location, and gain more independence.",1

985,"Hello, Mrs. Johnson! 😃

For our class assignment, we researched ways to incorporate healthy foods into school meals while still including students' favorite foods. This is an important topic because, let's face it, who doesn't love pizza? We also need to ensure that we are providing our bodies with good nutrition. Here's what I found:

One suggestion is to have a ""veggie day"" once a week, where meals revolve around different vegetables such as veggie pizza, veggie stir fry, or veggie quesadilla. Vegetables are crucial for health and come in a variety of flavors, making it exciting to have something new each week. However, not everyone may enjoy vegetables as much, so it's important to offer other healthy options as well.

Another idea is to have a ""flexible meal"" day, where students can choose between two or three healthy options like chicken quesadillas or salmon burgers. This allows students to pick their preferred meal while still maintaining a balanced diet. Giving students some control over their food choices is beneficial, although it may be challenging to come up with different options daily.

A third option is to have a ""student meal"" day, where students get to choose the menu for the day. They can look up healthy recipes online and prepare them together in the cafeteria. This would be a fun and educational experience for students, although it may be difficult to organize and ensure food safety.

In conclusion, each of these options has its advantages and disadvantages. Finding a balance between healthy and student-favorite foods in school meals is crucial. The flexible meal option seems like a good compromise as it allows students to have some control over their food choices.",1

Similarly, a car commercial may showcase a sleek vehicle driving on a scenic road, suggesting it is the best on the market.

987,"Marijuana, also known as weed or cannabis, has been a topic of debate for a long time. Some individuals believe it has positive effects, while others argue against it. There are various reasons why some view it favorably, but there are also concerns about its potential drawbacks.

One argument in favor of legalizing marijuana is its potential to aid individuals who are sick. For those suffering from illnesses that cause discomfort, marijuana can provide relief. It can also help alleviate pain, such as in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Additionally, it may assist those with sleep issues or anxiety.

Another reason for advocating marijuana legalization is the potential for government revenue. By taxing marijuana sales, the government could generate funds for public services like infrastructure, education, and healthcare, benefiting the country as a whole.

However, there are also reasons why marijuana may not be a wise choice. One major concern is its negative impact on health, including lung damage and cognitive impairment. It can also be addictive, leading to excessive use and potential harm to individuals' lives.

Furthermore, marijuana use can impair judgment, leading to risky behaviors like driving under the influence or engaging in violent actions. This poses a danger to both the individual and others around them.

In conclusion, there are valid arguments both for and against marijuana legalization. While it can offer relief to those in need and boost government revenue, it also carries health risks and potential dangers related to impaired judgment. I believe that marijuana should only be legal for medical purposes and strict regulations should be in place to ensure safe and responsible use. This way, marijuana can be a beneficial tool for those in need without causing harm.",1
988,"I wholeheartedly agree with Thomas Jefferson's belief that staying busy and productive is essential for achieving great things.

While I have struggled with idleness during tough times, I have found that staying busy can alleviate stress, create new opportunities, and foster new relationships.

In addition to the physical and mental advantages, staying active helps us learn and grow. By taking on challenges and pushing ourselves out of our comfort zones, we can develop new skills and improve our abilities, benefiting both our personal and professional lives.

Ultimately, I believe that the key to a fulfilling life is to never give up on our goals and always strive to be the best version of ourselves. By staying active and productive, we not only improve our own health and well-being, but also make a positive impact on the world around us.",1
989,"Dear Senator,

I am reaching out to you as a concerned citizen of the United States, advocating for the retention of the Electoral College as the preferred method of electing the President. Despite the arguments in favor of a popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College system offers numerous advantages that should be taken into consideration.

To begin with, the Electoral College ensures a clear and definitive outcome in presidential elections. While it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election, this has only occurred once since 1888 (in 2000). The winner-take-all aspect of the Electoral College requires a candidate to secure a majority of the electoral votes in order to become President, resulting in a decisive outcome.

Additionally, the Electoral College necessitates that candidates appeal to a broad range of voters across the country, rather than focusing solely on their own region or state. This ensures that the President is elected by the entire nation, rather than just a specific group or region.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, forcing them to pay attention to all states rather than just those they are likely to win. This guarantees that all voters have a say in the election and holds candidates accountable to the entire nation, not just their own supporters.

Moreover, the Electoral College helps to balance the political system by giving larger states, which often hold a disproportionate amount of power, more weight in the election. This ensures that the voices of all Americans are heard and prevents any one group or region from having too much influence.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the issue of elections where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This has only occurred once since 1888, and the Electoral College provides a clear and definitive outcome, eliminating the need for a runoff election.

In conclusion, while there are valid criticisms of the Electoral College system, I believe that it offers several important advantages that should not be overlooked. The certainty of outcome, broad appeal, focus on swing states, balance in the political system, and avoidance of runoff elections all contribute to the significance of the Electoral College in the American democratic process.

990,"Driverless cars, also known as self-driving cars, are vehicles that can operate without human intervention. They have sparked both excitement and debate in recent years as people question whether they are truly the future of transportation. The article ""Driverless Cars are Coming: A Look at the Future of Transportation"" discusses the positive and negative aspects of driverless cars, including current technology, limitations, privacy concerns, economic challenges, and the need for practical solutions.

I have a negative stance on driverless cars due to their current limitations, privacy concerns, and economic challenges. Despite technological advancements, current driverless cars are not reliable for complex driving scenarios at high speeds, making them impractical for everyday use. The need for constant vigilance from the driver also raises questions about the necessity of this technology. Additionally, the potential privacy violations from monitoring driver engagement with cameras could lead to increased stress and distraction while driving.

The economic implications of transitioning to driverless cars are significant, as the infrastructure changes required to support these vehicles would be costly and time-consuming. Building smart roads compatible with both driverless and traditional vehicles would incur exorbitant costs and pose challenges for many communities.

While some argue that self-driving cars could improve road safety and mobility for certain populations, the current limitations and challenges outweigh these potential benefits. Instead of focusing on developing self-driving cars further, manufacturers should concentrate on enhancing existing technology to improve safety and efficiency for all road users.

In conclusion, while the concept of driverless cars is intriguing, the practical implementation of this technology presents numerous challenges. The current limitations, privacy concerns, infrastructure requirements, and economic challenges make driverless cars a distant reality for many. It is essential to prioritize refining existing technologies to enhance safety and mobility on the roads, rather than solely focusing on futuristic advancements.",1
991,"My attempt at evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of extending the school day by 30 minutes as an average 8th grade student has been a topic of discussion at our school for some time. While some support the idea, others are opposed to it. As an 8th grader, I believe it is crucial to consider both the positives and negatives of this proposal.

One of the main advantages of extending the school day is the opportunity for more learning time. With an additional 30 minutes, we could cover more material in our classes, particularly in subjects like math and science that require extra practice and experimentation. Furthermore, more time for extracurricular activities, such as sports, music, or art classes, could aid in our overall development by allowing us to explore our talents and interests.

However, there are also drawbacks to extending the school day. One major concern is the potential negative impact on our mental and physical health. Students already face academic pressure, and adding more time to the school day could increase stress levels. Additionally, less time for extracurricular activities outside of school could affect our well-being and social growth. Some students may also have after-school jobs or other commitments that could be disrupted by a longer school day.

Another issue is the possibility of overcrowding in classrooms with an extended school day. More students could lead to a lack of individual attention from teachers, which could hinder our learning experience. Additionally, the school may struggle to provide sufficient resources and facilities to accommodate the increased student population.

In conclusion, while extending the school day by 30 minutes could offer more learning opportunities, it is essential to consider the potential drawbacks. Any changes to the school day should prioritize the well-being and success of students. Perhaps implementing a staggered schedule where some students attend school for the full day could be a solution.",1

One detrimental impact of technology is the diminishing of critical thinking skills. With easy access to the internet, individuals tend to rely on technology for answers rather than engaging in independent thought. This reliance can stifle creativity and innovation, as individuals are less inclined to think critically.

Furthermore, technology has led to a decrease in face-to-face social interaction, as people increasingly rely on devices for communication.

1001,"Since we had sent surveyors to Mars we have found many interesting things. We learned about much of the landscapes there and compared them to what we have here. Like the Earth, Mars also has a mesa boom. The face in the area of Mars know as Colonia is a mesa boom, so natural formations occur. The face that we have discovered is not an alien structure because almost no true scientists think it is alien, high resolution cameras showed no signs of alien life, and it is natural because it is in a mesa boom.

The first reason that you should not believe that the face is an alien monument is because almost all the scientists agree that it is not an alien structure. As it said in the article, ""Few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact."" They are the ones that truly study this topic and know all about it, so we need to believe them. They also took the picture to draw attention to Mars and how unique it is, not to convince every one that there are aliens. The picture was slightly blurred and showed a unique structure that was natural created.

The second reason is that the first image was Barry and did not have the best quality. This could have made it look like it was made by someone or something other than nature. The new images were career and proved that it was natural and that there were no alien artifacts.

The biggest and most obvious reason that should convince everyone is that it is a mesa boom. Things like this form all the time and should not be thought of a being made by anything other than nature. Take Earth for example, we have the same kind of region, and it has land forms just as unique and different in their own ways. The formation on Mars was just more unlikely to occur than the other ones. Throughout time things change, and chances are that the Earth has or has had a similar landform that looked like a head.

There is no proof that aliens are on Mars. There is no proof that aliens are real. Nobody will ever be able to prove that aliens created the face because it will change, and eventually will not look like a face anymore. The face on Mars is obviously not an alien relic because almost every scientist agrees, high resolution pictures show it is not alien, and it is a mesa boom, so this is natural.",0

As you see ""electoral college was established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"", says source 1. Although that sounded great at the time, today electoral college is frowned upon because majorly because of its ""winnertakeall"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. As if that wasn't unfair enough, the electors don't even necessarily have to vote for their states choice. This would be similar to if I was infatuated with a color, I then asked my team what our team color should be and after taking a vote, I chose the color I preferred because I was bias even though my whole team disliked it. This is obviously the wrong way to run our election especially the most important in our country.

On the other hand I do understand that there are some advantages to an electoral college. These include, mentioned in source 3, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaignthan a small state does. This is fair because there are more people in big states then small therefore big states should get more of a voice. Although in popular vote big states would still get the bigger vote because there are more people voting therefore they have more votes. This is why I think the middle man should just be cut out leaving us with a popular vote.

According to the facts it is clear to me that the electoral college should be siezed. I think it is unnecessary as well as unfair. When we think of voting for our president, that is what we want to do. Voting for our president does not include voting for someone who may or may not choose our choice. Also if we chose our President by popular vote all the votes that weren't majority would add up and possibly make the difference between the vote results. This is why it is unfair to simply use majority rule for each state and practically erase the other votes off the table. As you can see State Senator your people vote to elect their ruler. Why deny them of this oppurtunity. It is clear to me that the electoral college may have been a good concept to our founding father but when applyed is not the best decision. This is why I think you should change to an election by popular vote for president of the United States.",0
1003,"Dear Principal:

I think that this situation should be handled with the effort to in courage the students to want them to try harder.

Also, I think by giving the students that try harder to get there work done something to make them feel rewarded. Will make the other students jealous and make them want to try harder instead of the teacher forcing them to want to try.

Also, I think that it should be a law that a child should have to be able to participate in sports. So that the child will not only try harder but will still get the exercise that maybe he or she needs but does not get at home academically. So that is the reason why think that the students should be able to participate in sports and other activities. This how it should work if they have : A's, C's, or C's they can play sports and activity's also with one D. Cut if they have two D's, or an F they can not",0
1004,"Hello, my name is Luke Merger, and I am in the Seagoing Cowboys program. Here in the Seagoing Cowboys program you are able to help people, travel the world, and also have fun a long the way. Now I will tell you about the experiences I have had as a Seagoing Cowboy and why you should join.

First I am going to tell you why I became a Seagoing Cowboy. When I graduated from high school I had no idea what to do. Until my friend Don Last invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I couldn't say no. I knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Then I started my journey.

It was 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. These countries needed food supplies, animals, and more to recover. That's when 44 nations joined together to form UNRWA. UNRWA was an administration that hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of animals that were shipped overseas. That's when Don and I signed up for the Seagoing Cowboys.

After the Pacific War ended in August 1945. We received orders to report to New Orleans. The orders were to ship a cargo of 335 horses, plus enough hay and oats to feed them to Greece. The cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have to opportunity to travel to many places. I have crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and crossed the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War 2. I have also been to Europe and China. But seeing Greece was special to me.

Most people think being a Seagoing Cowboy is all hard work and that we don't have any fun. The people who say that is very wrong, Seagoing Cowboys have a lot of fun on their spare time. When we finish our orders we take some time off and do fun activities. In Venice, Italy, I took a gondola ride over a city with streets of water. In China, I also toured an excavated castle, and marveled at the Panama Canal. Another way we have fun is on board. When the ships have been unloaded we play baseball games, volleyball games, fencing, boxing, and many other fun things to help pass time.

In conclusion, you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program to help people in need, travel the world, and have fun a long the way. Being a Seagoing Cowboy has been much more than an adventure for me, Luke Merger. It has opened up the world to me.",0

If we as human beings keep relying on cars as much as we do the world will be in bad shape

US as people have to treat the earth better because this is our home ,this is were we have to live and many generations after us have live .

The number of miles driven per person in america has definetly decreased over the years, the recession had a lot to do with that. With that being saidmany measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is underway. The rates of car ownership in america has also decresed. Maybe that means something more fundamental is going on.

By us using cars as much as we do pullution starts to happen. One of the biggest pollutes cars cause is smog.

smog is like fog but it contains gases and if we keep relying on cars as much as we do the world wont be a safe place for us to live. Smog got so bad in france that they had to stop people from drivng.

Maybe we should be more like vauban,germany and have less cars, '' when i had a car i was always tense, but im much happier without a car '' says heidrun walter . Vauban completed in 2006,is a growing trend in europe,the united states and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a compnent of a movement called '' smart planning ''

One if president obamas goals is to curve greenhouse gas emmissions, and i support that fully. studys sho that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licences as earch year goes by. This makes me question wether or not america hass passed peak driving. if this behavior persists the socioligists believe that we will have beneficial  implications for carbon emmisions and the enviroment,sense transportation is the second largest source of americas emmisions.

It has been scientifically proven that the Face is nothing more than a rocky landform. Although it may seem to be formed my aliens, the Face truly is ousted a natural rock formation. There is no actual evidence of life on other planets. Why assume that oust by a mesa? The Face is made up of shadows. You, too, can probably make shadows that look like something it is not.

NASA has taken photos at different pixel sizes. Not everyone agrees with NASA's statement because they truly believe that NASA is hiding information from them. Talk about the Face began after some people decided that it would be a ""good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Afterwards, many conversations and arguments were about the Face. It became a pop icon once it reached across the nation. Many people paid attention more to what they were watching rather than what they were told by NASA, the people with the facts.

Conspiracy theorists began saying that NASA was holding out on them by not saying the complete truth about their discovery. Much goes into a discovery that shouldn't go without appreciation. Scientists still held onto their beliefs and avoided correction by a few simple facts. The time that the first picture was taken could have been a perfect time that the sun was creating a shadow. I believe that the Face is ousted shadows that are made by indents on Mars. You would need to have more than pictures of a rock formation to support your theories on whether alien life does exist or not. More goes into a theory if you can support it with proper evidence.",0

Optional Extracurricular Activities

Should it be forced that all students participate in at least one after school activity? I believe students should not be forced to join an extracurricular activity. It is definitely a great experience and attention should be brought to it but not as a requirement. There are multiple dram backs and problems it can cause for families. At first, you might think it's a great idea but if you really think about That has to be done so that children can attend meetings, you might change your mind.

One of great things about public schools is that they're free and most things are cheaper. This is extremely helpful for families MHO are financially struggling but Many their kids to have an education. A lot of after school clubs or sport teams do things that might cost more than That some families can afford. Parents could feel stressed because they know they can't afford it but at the same time, Many their kids to be happy and healthy. Financial problems can cause problems for some families, especially Then the school tells them their children are required to do an extracurricular.

Some extracurricular activities don't end until 5 p. m. or later. There are so many students that struggle With focusing and need more time to unkind after a long day. If they are required to participate in an after school club, this brings even more stress to them. They Mill be tired Then they get home and still have homework to do, causing a student to be up later, Which affects their sleep schedule. The less sleep they get, the more tired they are during the school day. Affecting their learning ability. Forcing students to attend a sport or other activity can affect their performance in school in a negative May.

Another drawback that forcing students to attend an extracurricular activity is the need of transportation. Public schools transport kids to school and back by bus, Which makes the life of families easier. Maybe parents More till 6 p. m. and therefore can't pick up their child. Forcing students to participate in after school clubs or sports can be a problem for families that aren't able to pick up their kids. Of course, parents can carpool but that just adds extra stress to the parents MHO already do so much. They might think that they have to pay back other parents that help transport their kids. Having extracurricular activities not required can let parents find a club that is suitable to their ability to transport their children home.

In conclusion, there are so many problems that forcing students to participate in one or more extracurricular activities causes. The extra stress on families is a lot to handle and Mill not make things easier. Although joining clubs or sports in your school is a fantastic experience and great thing to have on future resumes, it should be optional. Schools should bring attention to the activities to get students interested instead of requiring it. That's May I disagree With the idea that a school Mold have it be a necessity for students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. ",0
1009,"""Driverless Cars AIE Coming"" is a great article and makes a lot of great points about this product. My opinion on driverless cars is I think it's a great idea. Also, their could be a downside to this product as well.

A publictIanspoItation taxi system that use half the fuel of today's taxis would be a great idea. It would be great for the environment, as well as us as people. This system would for sure change the would. The Google cars that work independently have driven half a million miles although a collision. Which is great because their goes a lot of injured people and totaled cars that people need as transportation. At the same time, these cars still need a human to operate them under certain conditions such as, puling in and out of places, driving through construction places oi CAI accidents. The idea of the cars Running on a track is a Gina idea as well, but their is just no time to fix all these Roads to make OUI cars driverless. Also, the cost of this would be too expensive. Also, if the CAI could operate on its own, I would think that the drive would be even more careless than they already AIE and would pay even less attention. If the CAI would still need the drive to be albeit in case of needing to take over, drivers would just be more tempted to look away and do other things while driving, and then if the CAI needed the drive to take over they will have already crashed because the drive was distracted by something else. In my opinion driverless cars is a goof idea in some ways, but in other ways they AIE dangerous. They AIE nice to have, but only if you AIE able to be Responsible with them. You need to be able to have self discipline to be able to operate a CAI like this and stay albeit even if the CAI is driving for you. Anything can happen in a split second. A plus side to them would be if you AIE someone that works in the city and always has to sit and wait in Push hour, then this would be a good CAI for you to have. The CAI would drive for you in this mess, so you wouldn't get so tried of it. But something that I would worry about personally is trusting the CAI to do its job. It is a machine, it could malfunction and make a mistake. Like if it doesn't stop when the Best of the traffic does and it Yearends someone. OI it doesn't go when the Best of the traffic does and someone Yearends you. It could be dangerous, and the CAI messing up like that wouldn't be the buyers fault, it is just still something I would worry about as a drive of a driverless CAI.

The points made in this article AIE very helpful to understand the progress being made with driverless cars. They would definitely benefit us in the future, and make CAI pileups a thing of the past.",0
1010,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think Policy 1 would be a better Choice. My feeling this way is because students should have some freedom and be able to use there Well phones at the times stated. This would resolve the issue of them trying to sneak on their phone during Class time, when there suppose to be learning. I would recommended that you Those this policy because then students will know that they won't get there phones taken by staff members. Also, if there was an emergency then they would need to be able to use there phones during that free time. If students Those to waste the time stated to use there phones, and try to use them during Class time then the teacher should take them. Also, if you were to Those Policy 2 students would just disobey and AOT like they didn't know. So I say Policy 1 students should be allowed to use there Well phones at the given times stated.

1011,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author believes that studying and exploring Venus is worth the pursuit despite the dangers it brings. The author uses facts and information to back this idea up. The author has facts on poor conditions on Venus then gives us information and ideas on ways to overcome. The author is using a problem and solution method.

The author supported the idea with facts and more ideas that would make it safer and beneficial to us if we travel to Venus for further examination. In the article the author talks about how Venus has really bad conditions, but they are all just challenges that can be overcome. These challenges are the main thing holding us back from exploring further. The author believes that our travels beyond Earth should'nt be limited by dangers and doubts.

The article also talkes about how we need longer lasting technology for further research. It mentions mechanical computers and how they don't require electronics at all. The author suggests using the mechanical parts, like the ones used in the mechanical computers, and using them to create technology that will last longer on Venus. This would allow for more research. More research means better understanding of Venus which will allow for better technology to with stand the conditions.

In the paragraph above the author gives us a problem on how our technology can't survive the conditions, because the systems get fried and break. Then the author gives us a possible solution to our problem. The author gives us a new idea for better technology. The author uses a problem and solution to support the idea.

In conclusion, the author supported the idea well by using a problem and then giving a solution using facts and evidence. The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it represents. The author then goes on to show us that these dangers can be overcome and these dangers shouldn't stop us from exploring.",0
1012,"""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."" Nick D'Alto. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is very abusing system that can read how a human is feeling. The thought of a computer software being able to decipher what I'z feeling is shocking. I believe the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of a student in a classroom is valuable. There are zany reasons why I agree with the use of the FACS. For instant, technology would be able to identify how you feel about what you're learning, it'll make you a more emotional person, and it will help you stay on task. I think the FACS has a good chance of changing the future in a positive way.

The FACS was designed to recognize six every day emotions. This would be helpful when a student is confused or does not understand what the teacher is trying to teach. The system could then modify the classwork that the student is working on. With more practice the computer could then change the difficulties of the assignment according to how the student feels. For an example lets say a gentleman is stuck on a path problem. The frustration that the gentleman is showing will be seen by the computer. The computer will then help the gentleman by modifying it or informing the teacher where he is struggling. This will better his education and help out more when students are scared to ask for help.

The positive effect that the FACS has on the students is another reason why it will be valuable in classrooms. In the passage it says,"" According to Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also day even help produce the. (""Putting on a happy face"" actually works!)"". This proves that it has been proven by experts that this system could help spread positive vibes. ""Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so such about the science of emotions!"".

Finally, the FACS could help identify when students are bored and are not paying attention. This will help a student pay attention and not stay behind. The solution to this would be to modify the information to be interesting or less difficult for a student. I assume that this would decrease the amount of missing assignments and improve grades. This will be better for the students to gain knowledge.

In conclusion the Facial Action Coding System should be used in classrooms for students. They will help improve their interest in topics at school, help the students understand better, it will help students be more positive, and finally is will have a big impact on all of us. The Facial Action Coding System would be a new way of gaining more knowledge. It will help students and teachers understand each other better. Overall this would be a positive impact along us all.

1013,"The Electoral College has many amazing things' people like about using it. When it comes to voting not many people do.That's why in the Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. There are about 538 electors, now that's a lot of people if you ask me. Only 270 of the electoral votes is required to elect the President which is an okay amount of votes for the President election.

On the other hand, under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who is a inturn elect the president. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, but the system allows much worse. People are more worried about having a tie in the electoral vote. The election would be thrown in the House of Representatives, where state delegation vote on the President, also the senate would choose the Vice President.

Not everyone thinks the same tho about electoral College because some people don't like it because some states have more representatives, but yet again what if it was your state that have the most representatives like California with 55 of them wouldn't you want a huge advantage like that? I know I would.",0
1014,"Driving is often one of the most frightening things to many people whether they are starting to get their permit, or if they've been driving for a long time. The idea of driverless cars came to the mind of Sergey Brin, the cofounder of Google. He even envisions a future where the public can have access to a transportation system such as cars that can drive themselves, and a public transport taxi system that uses half the fuel of modern cars. On the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author wrote about the positive and negative sides to these inventions. The article covers many things about them; however, it does not fully explain the true nature of such vehicles being available for public use. These cars should not be allowed to be bought and used by the public.

As stated in paragraph two of the article, it states that these driverless cars aren't fully driverless. These cars have no crash thus far, but how safe is it really compare to their rival brands? ""Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents,"" What the sentence means is that these cars don't have one hundred percent control of how they drive. They require the driver to be full alert when pulling in and out of their driveways. Little do they know, that accidents can still happen when they have claimed they are better than any other car brand that uses the same radars and sensors.

Google isn't the first company to think of a smart car which isn't a surprise to those who have looked into different car brands. Companies like Tesla, Mercedes Benz, Audi and Nissan plan to have driverless cars by the year 2020. On 2013, BMW announced their development of a car called the ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" The difference between the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" and the driverless car is that BMW added a design to where the car itself notifies the driver when human skill is required. Another design element to the car is that the driver's seat actually vibrates to alert the driver when the vehicle is in danger of backing into any object. This choice of car is safer than the driverless car as the Google car relies on the driver to focus on the road. Every driver has looked away from the road before, so it wouldn't be a surprise if an accident were to occur. Though there is another safety measure added to the Google car, a camera to watch the driver to make sure they keep their eyes on the road ahead. This could lead to some issues for privacy as people have been sensitive in the pass about their identities being shown to corporations. Not only could this lead to court sessions, but also lead to a possible debt for the company.

As stated earlier, the author did list both negative and positive things about the Google car. Paragraph eight shows the psychological side for drivers with this car, ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?

We have to Internet the driving fun in a new way,"" Dr. Werner Huber stated. Manufacturers hope to do that by having entertainment and information systems that have displays that turn off when the driver needs to pay attention, an option driver who want to use their electronic devices do not have. OT is stated that this option is a safety feature; however it could be more of a distraction. The use of electronics has increased, and today's modern society is easily distracted by this. When the car needs the driver to take the wheel, how will the driver react while they're busy looking at a screen? Safety is a big concern, and so everything should be looked at and thought through.

States nationwide have already made it illegal to drive test computer driven cars. Some states have limited the use of it, and it is because the safety of the cars are still not certain. Of the car is proven to be of safe use, new laws will have to be made and so will the coverage of liability in a case of an accident. Of most states have seen it as unsafe, why continue to research ways to make smart cars? Automechanics have focused on their work, and assume that these problems will be solved in the near future. How can we be so sure?

Technology every day is improving little by little, and so is the need to travel. We have the technology to make whatever the mind wants to create, but some ideas should stay ideas. OT's not a terrible idea, but it could bring more trouble for everyone business to home workers alike. Safety to the public should always be the number one concern, not how high-tech the car itself is. Instead of causing more accidents due to the car mechanics, we should let the drivers learn properly how to drive.",0
1015,"Technology has changed a lot of ways that we live today. Nowadays we have phones that can recogonize our faces by just looking at it, anyone could make any facial expression by looking at their phone and it will set it as a passcode and in which phones are protected from other people that try to get into it. Having a computer that recgonizes is an outstanding piece of work, and as younger kids get much older they will be able to learn about how technology has improved the way of living. Students in this era may have some kind interest in going into computer science or go into anything that has to do with technology.

The use of technology that can read facial expressions is remarkable. Students will be absolutely amazed of how a computer can show wheather the person is either happy, confused, sad, or angry. Students can use the facial expression software to find out how they are feeling. For instince in paragraph 6 the author states ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different (par.6)."" In this quote the author clearly explains how amazingly smart a comupter can be. Being able to develop that technology is one of a kind. The author also stated in paragraph 6, video games and video surgery technology works the same way, for example many students enjoy playing video games in their spare time, and if they are into a game they are really into, the technology and software bulit into the game will able to show the audience the characters expression inside of the game.

Moving foward, the famous painting of Mona Lisa may seem like she is 100 percent smiling right? Wrong. The famous painting has had many people have conterversal arguments about her facial expression, thinking she is serious or smiling. According to the author, they explain

""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry (par.1)."" This shows how much techonlogy has improved during the past years. Having new software that can inform students the real expression on someone's face through face to face or through a picture or painting is insane. Teachers will be able to ask their studnets how people are feeling by they way they express their emotion, and show them the actual feeling behind the expression.

Futhermore, students can have an idea of how the way technology works and how it is set up. Being able to work with technology that can show statistics the way people express their feelings is outstanding. In paragraph 9, the author explains how the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion explains how a person's facial muscle moves while they express the way they are feeling. It also states that it can even help produce the emotion while peforming the facial expression ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them (par.9).""

In conclusion, studnets that have accsess to this advanced technology that can read expressions is valuable and worth keeping in the future. Not only will it amuse the students but it can also help them learn about the new improvements that are being created while they get older. Technology is becoming a much more valuable, powerful tool and helping change the way we live and how we view technology.         ",0

The electoral college should be abolished because it has caused multiple problems over the past years during elections AHD could continue to cause problems. The electoral college process consists of selecting electors, as you show, but those electors do hot always vote for their parties candidates like they should. This process causes the popular vote to hot always guarantee presidency to a certain candidate even if they have the popular vote.

Lay I think that this 'race' Is just a natural forms because, take the moon JOR example, there is a bunch OJ hilly things on there, It just so happened that there is a rock on Mars that looks like a race. Marines team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution.

That is how they captured the 'race' on Mars, OJ course there it's gonna be an extraordinary thing that there is a race on Mars, There are so many things in the world that are strange, and nobody seems to find those strange, maybe it's because the 'race' specific takes place on Mars.

huge rock formation. . . Which resembles a human head. . . Jormed by shadows giving the illusion OJ eyes, nose, and mouth.

This supports my claim because maybe the 'race' is a rock that just so happened to look like a race, NLSL sometimes takes things to jar when it comes to things like these. huge rock formation...."" It basically says that the rock is a formation "".......giving the illusion......"" IT also stated that the rock gave an illusion that is has eyes, nose, LND a mouth. I clearly give out that opinion that IJ you put it together you get ""L huge rock formations giving the illusion........."" and so on.

I also think that The 'race' Is just a rock the looks like a race, clearly I stated that. Let's just break it down The race is a rock, which appeared on Mars, NLSL said it gave the illusion that it was a race, NLSL also believes that since it was on Mars, Aliens created it. That's what you get when you break down the story, Even IJ it was created by aliens, who cares, it's a rock, there is nothing special about it except how it looks like a race, just because it was on Mars doesn't mean aliens created it. I know being creative is an amazing thing, but it's just a rock the formed into a race, just like how over times 300 million years ago when dinosaurs exist the earth was whole, and over time it TRANSFORMED into what it has become now. Notice how I used the word transformed, ...""over time it transformed ....."" in the text... ""Huge rock Formation."" It is just a rock that's looks like a race, and just because it's on Mars don't mean a thing.",0
1019,"The choices people make, should be influenced by the people around them. By asking their pears around them, it can benefit the person deciding whether to preside with his or her ideas. Asking people for help on a decision can also slightly effect the person being asked to help. Everyone is different in their own ways, and by getting a different point of view on a big decision can really impact you. When deciphering on a choice being made, having the influence of other peoples opinions is a great way to, make sure the outcome of the choice being made is the right decision, help the person making the decision, and influencing the person being asked.

Asking for advise can impact the person asking in a huge way. By getting multiple point of views on the issue, it could stop the person from making a bad decision, that could affect their life. Nobody or brain is the same in any way, so by asking someone for advise, you could get something completely different from what they expected, but it would be the right decision and the decision they needed. Someone could agree on the same thing but, they could have different reasons why. A person could believe say suicide is their best option because they think they have nothing left to lose, but someone else that really loves that person could think that's a terrible idea. Asking that person weather or not to do something so extreme as suicide or even a small thing could benefit them in a huge way.

When asking a person for advise it can not only affect the person asking but the person being asked. Being asked by a person that necessarily isn't your best friend, or a family member could mean a lot to the person being asked. It could make them feel wanted or mean something to that particular person. You wouldn't really think asking a person for advise would really impact a person that much, but it defiantly could. Also, when someone asks for advise the person being asked could also have the same problem or a problem like it. For example again someone could be thinking about suicide, but when they ask someone, that person could be thinking the same thing. Since they found each other they can help each other. If something like that were to happen, both of the people maybe wouldn't feel alone anymore because they would have someone else with that same issue or something like it.

Making sure the outcome of the choice is right, helping the person making the decision, and influencing the person being asked, is all a part of having the influence of other peoples decisions when deciphering on a choice being made. Having the influence of another point of view can influence the persons decision greatly by possibly, saving there life by choosing the better decision, increase the chance of picking the best decision, etc. Also, when asking about a decision it can influence the person being asked by, making them feel worthy, maybe having something in common with the person asking, and many more things. The decision someone makes may not even be a greatly big decision. Or maybe it is one, but either way getting a different point of view on it, may be a fantastic way to pick the right decision.  ",0

1021,"Dear Florida Senator,

I understand that every 4 years on the first Tuesday of November, the United States undergoes a change in Presidency. This change should be decided in a proper manner by the people and citizens of the country. This explains the purpose of this letter, to abolish the Electoral College. I have this opinion because it is unfair to the people. Sometimes, the electors tend to provoke the system too. However, if there is a way to keep it, we can use it if there is a tie between the Presidency voting.

The best argument that I have towards this action is plain and simple: it's unfair! Voting is all about Loin to the poll and having the excitement of knowing that your vote can change the next 4 years of your life, including America's life. This should not include the other electors in the house or the people in office. This is a democracy country, therefore, we the people should decide who the President is. With the Electoral College in process, the citizens votes are not a 100% necessity. The

Winner Takes all voting should be established. It's just floating around because it's the first step in voting. The next step is the Electoral College where Congress makes the next decision. This is wrong because the people need to have the final say on the voting because we are effected the most.

Another important reason why the Electoral College needs to be voted out is because the electors in Congress tend to provoke the voting. According to

Source 1:

What is the Electoral College, you are actually choosing your candidate's electors, not the actual president. Now your trust is in the candidates hands. At this point in time, you probably think its safe right? That those people know what there doing, but chances are that they don't. There Does many other things to stress about! At one point, the candidates did not even vote for the ""correct"" President which is a stab in the back to the voters. This is why there are trust issues with the voting.

Besides all the relativity that you've been hearing throughout this letter, there is a possibility that we can compromise. First, all the people that want to vote will vote, but the Electoral College will only be needed if there is a tie between the people to Presidency vote. If not, then the people decide. Without the Electoral College present, the smaller states have the same equality and strength as the larger states as

Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president says. That source clearly implies that voters tend to pay too much attention to the campaign but everyone including the people in Congress see it, so what really makes the difference in voting? Without the Electoral College, voting would not be so indecisive.

To sum it all up, the Electoral college is just an unnecessary back up plan when there is not one needed. It is unfair to the citizens and the candidate's electors are unreliable. If there was a way to keep the Electoral College, it would only be for ties. It wouldn't be needed if the vote was a clean win. When the President Election comes in the next 3 years, I hope that you consider my thoughts, because there are plenty people out there with the same perspective.  ",0
1022,"Death Senator,

I feel as if we got hid from the electoral college it would just cause us more trouble that we AHE dealing with at the moment. The electoral college helps us so dramatic, and some people just don't understand how much it really helps. Everyone might think they know so much about the electoral college, like if we got high of it everything would just be fine. No one really knows what really goes on all the time. I could not imagine if we were to even et hid from the electoral college that has been there since out founding fathers.

If we going to change the election to buy a popular vote things would get out of hand and hobble things could happen. Large states as Texas, California, and Minnesota would have a ""winnehtakeall"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. People not in those states would get angry and things would get bad. It takes 270 out of 538 to be elected president and if changing to popular vote FOH the election would be thelahgest state elector would be the president.

Yes there AHE things that AHE wrong in the electoral college but nothing is perfect as we all know. In Texas if you wanted to vote FOH John Key you'd vote FOH a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Key, and that's just one thing that is wrong. Another thing wrong about the electoral college is a tie in the electoral vote. If happened the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where stated legations vote on the president. Then the senate would then choose the vicephesident. Because each state casts only né vote, the single hephesentive from Wyoming, representing 500,00 votes, would have as much as the 55 hephesenyives.

When you vote FOH a presidential candidate you'he's actually voting FOH a slate of electors. The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate decides a majority of the votes cast.  Nixon and Clinton both had only a 43 percent chancepluhality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college. There is pressure FOH runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.

If the election changed to a popular vote things as we know it would change hastily.",0

1024,"A college study states that students are five times more productive when they work from dome. This means that students would benefit from attending class from dome. TDE reasons for this are, students are in a more relaxed environment and are less distracted by other peers.

When students Dave to leave dome every day and be around so many people it can get a little overwhelming. Meaning they are being PGT out of their comfort zones. This can case them to show poor results in TDE classroom. TNE student said"" While they attended school they were a straight C student, BGT when they began homeschooling their grades significantly increased."" Later a parent stated that their kid dad never been comfortable around large groups of people. This could Dave been avoided by removing that student from that stressful situation and allowing them to be domed in a controlled environment.

It is a well known fact that students are distracted by their peers. This means students are missing important parts of class by talking with other students or watching other students do silly things in class. Taking these kids out of school, and leaving them at dome to attend class makes them isolated from their peers giving them no distractions from others. This also allows their fall attention to be on their work. This makes them more productive and able to take in more information.

When it comes to being comfortable or distracted at school these things all add GP to one thing, limitations placed on students being able to learn at school. These things seem minor BGT they each play a role in students academic successes and can be avoided if you allow your student or child to learn from dome. Being able to learn from dome is a very beneficial idea that schools and teachers most take advantage of.",0
1025,"Have you ever wish to learn at home? Or in your bed? Well with online or video conferences you can, but many people would think that is a bad idea. Would students benefit on the online classes? UES they would and not only them; this will be also beneficial for others because it will be less tressfull, new objectives could come out of it, and more sleep. Taking online courses would benefit to everyone, but only if it's use correctly and responsible.

One of the reasons of why students should take online classes is because is less stress in their student's lives. Stress can be dangerous to people and students. They are getting more stress in school for many reasons, waking up early, going on time to take the bus even in cold days, or if the student drive he has to check for traffic, taking classes with different teachers, and many more just in school high school; students are just teenagers that are starting high school. This is the most important steps in their lives, and with the online classes they can leave those other worries and focus more on their studies, and this can be done with the online courses. They don't have to worry about going late to school, or waking up early they have the access they need in their computer.

Another reason why it would be a good idea to take online classes is that new objectives can come out of it for example. Saving more the natural environment, the students would have to use less their cars or have to take public transportation; all of this liberates pollution which is a problem now in days. More jobs for the other teachers, with the only courses they need teachers if the students wants to have some kind of personal teacher to teach them, this can create more jobs for the teachers, and the teacher can also teach from their homes; this not only benefit the students it also benefits the teachers. This can be also open new ways of learning one example is, if the teacher is sick, but would still want to work to make money to pay their debts. This can allow the interaction with the student without the worry of getting them sick. The more use of technology, as the new aeration comes and new technologies are invented we have to get use them in every way possible, and start with the use of our technology that we have in hand like computer, cell phones and new technologies that can benefit all of us.

One of many reasons why it would be a good idea to use online classes is that we would get more sleep. As simple, it sounds this is a problem in many schools were they have students sleeping in their classes. This is creating a problem between the students, and the teachers were some situation the teachers are also tired from grading homework, or staying at school late for work or an event; however, with the online classes the students and the teachers can make a schedule in which they can agree with. Many people could say that is easy to solve such a problem, and will be for the students to sleep early or don't work so late, but either way this keep going and many students fall sleep at their classes especially in the first two. This is one of many reasons why this will be a good idea for students to use online courses.

Why would be a good idea for students to use online classes? Well it is a good idea for students to use online programs that help them with their studies which can, release stress, new way of using the technology, and help more students to get them more sleep. These is great things to considerate; however, this also have their downsides like less work for bus drivers, fewer students going to work or more laziness for students that don't get out of their rooms to do some exercise, bur either way not everything has only good or bad ideas just that we have to know how to use them.",0

1028,"The Face of Mystery

Groundbreaking news has been unleashed to the public. NASA has found a face on Mars! However, it is really a face?

NASA declared the ""face"" to actually be a martian mesa. Although, some people believe that it is a face that was made by aliens.

Scientists believe that the ""face"" on Mars is actually a landform. According to paragraph seven in the article, ""Thousands of anixous web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing... a natural landform."" NASA had a picture to prove that it was not an alien monument.

NASA

had also compared the martian mesa to other mesas around the western United States, according to paragraph twelve in the article. NASA had also mentioned that the pictures in the past had worse resolutions than the ones we have today, which can be one of the main factors of having the martian mesa look like a face.

NASA had taken the first picture of the ""face"" in 1976 and the last one in 2001. Over the years, NASA has spent lots of money on this project. All of their hard work and money has paid off. Due to their large interest, they were able to figure out that the ""face"" was a martian mesa. Their huge discovery led to learn about landforms on Mars. They had sucessfully unmasked the ""face""

1029,"Venus is our closest planet to us besides Mars (sometimes) but does that mean that we should start to think about the possibilities of us landing there? The author of the article ""The Challenges of exploring Venus"" is suggesting that we should go forward and try to study and hopefully go to Venus despite the dangers that are capable of happening. Venus may be our ""twin planet"", but it is very different from earth. I think the author of this article supports this idea very much.

There are a couple of reasons on why I think the author supports this article. One is because he talks about how Venus could have been. Venus is the most marshlike planet that we know in our solar system, but they don't exactly know if it once was like us or not. Astronomers think that Venus was once covered with oceans, and it could even have supported forms of life. The author also talks about the features of Venus today. The author points out that the plant has some similar features as us like valleys, mountains, and craters. The author ends the paragraph, where he talks about this, with this sentence, ""The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making a mission both safe and scientifically productive."" This makes me think that the author is trying to get us informed about the options that it could take to make this Venus situation be safer.

This information we know about the planet is very different from ours. One of the details that the author points out is that it has a thick atmosphere of most 97% carbon dioxide. Another thing he says is that the clouds are made up of sulfuric acid and that the temperature is 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The author makes it clear that the conditions on Venus are very extreme, and it would make a bad environment for us. With this information, the author makes it clear that NASA is still trying to find a possible solution for safety reasons and informational reasons.

One of the ways that NASA is trying to study Venus is by sending a ""blimplike vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" They would have to be in the air to fly over storms and get out of the way of the unfriendly ground conditions. In the air, the temperature would still be way too hot, but they think that humans would be able to survive that condition. The air pressure in the air will be close to the same pressure that's on the earth. At the end of the paragraph that talks about this, the author says that obviously these are not the best conditions, but they are survivable for humans.

These are my claims on why and how the author is telling us that he supports the idea. He talks about the similarities and differences about the planet and earth. He also talks about the possibilities this could happen in the future once we get more information. This is why I think that the author is supporting the idea of studying Venus even if the conditions are bad.  ",0
1030,"I think its valuable and there are a lot of reasons why I think that. One reason why I think that is because it can tell you how other students feel. Like one example the Facial Action Coding System can tell the type of mood.

Another reason why I think the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for use students they can probably read a lot of the facial expressions, in the text it said"" And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans used to express how we feel!""

Another reason why I think its valuable is because it also said about the FACS, that some guy named Beckman, creator of FACS in the passage said that ""Beckman has classified six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, digest, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" flats another reason why I think that.

Well these are why I think the FACS is valuable in a classroom. Fo me the could also read any person expressions, emotions or feelings.",0
1031,"""The challenge of studying Venus"" is a very interesting story. In the story the author tells us a lot about Venus and its harsh conditions. The title describes the story very well. Venus seems like it would be very challenging to explore and the author gives many reasons why it would be so difficult. For some reason though he doesn't really list any benefits to exploring Venus.

Throughout the whole story the author is just making Venus sound like a horrible place. In the article he writes"" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" Again he is describing Venus to sound like an awful place, so why would you want to explore it. Another good claim he makes is that, ""since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.""

Why would you go explore Venus in a spacecraft if all of them were destroyed. If it where me I would not want to explore Venus, the author has given me plenty of reasons not to.

Throughout the story the author does list at least one benefit to exploring Venus. In the story he writes,"" it may well once Haxe been the most Earthlike planet in our solar system."" Yes I can agree that would be a great reason to explore Venus, but here are the downsides to that. Venus now is not like Earth, it is more like a destroyed Earth. The author writes"" on the planets surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit."" You can't even walk on the surface without burning up, how is this like Earth? The author also mentions,"" Venus was probably covered largely with oceans."" All those oceans that may Haxe been there are gone now. Why would we explore a destroyed Earth?

In conclusion the author does not give many benefits to exploring Venus. All he really did was list the benefits to why we shouldn't explore Venus. In my personal opinion if i were a scientist and someone read me this I would not want to explore Venus. In the end I do not believe the author makes a good case to explore Venus.",0
1032,"In this essay I will be giving an argument on who this so-called ""face"" is not made by aliens.

The prompt tells you that one of four colleagues says that it is created by aliens.

Me job in this essay is to tell who it isn't and give an explanation.

The figure that NASA saw was a so-called ""face on Mars"".

The claimed that it was in the shape of a human head, and it was thought to be made by aliens.

In me opinion this is not made by aliens.

Here is a reason who.

All these years NASA has gone to a two or three planets looking for aliens.

Throughout the years how many have we found, none!

Yes, we may have found some traces of aliens, but we can not prove that these are actually alien tracks, or alien lifeforms.

There is no was to prove that this structure was made by aliens, unless we have images of them, and so far we have none.

Look down on earth.

How many mesas or Buttes do we have in America, or even around the world?

Now think about this, were these man made?

No, none of these land formations were man made!

The are formed naturally by nature.

Now over the years we have found a lot of reasons how Mars is sort of like the earth.

It carries water, and it is one of the easiest planets to get to, so if you think about it, Mars could have the same land formations as we do!

Nature is a beautiful thing, and it more than likely made this so-called ""face"".

Yes, you may be right in some was.

Yes, we have found traces of aliens over the years.

This COULD have been made by aliens.

Maybe the are trying to connect to other life outside their planet.

That is the only argument that you have against me.

The argument that isn't even factual.

You are going off of a guess in four mind.

So overall in this essay I have covered three things.

I have covered me first argument, which is that we have not found aliens even though we have been searching all of these years.

I have covered me second argument, which is that nature has formed many structures like this on earth, it could have been formed out of the land.

And I also covered the rebuttal, which is that there is a possibility that this was built by aliens because we have found traces.

So in conclusion, this structure was not built by humans, this was land made.",0

1034,"Senator of Florida, I'm writing you today to address the issue about keeping the Electoral College or changing it to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. Let's start off, by pointing out that the Electoral College is an antique, and we should upgrade, also there could be many issues when using that method and many not wanted decisions can become official. Let me guide you through this important topic, and help you make this fair for everyone.

Like I pointed out before, the Electoral College is very old, Richard A. Poster stated"" The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism"" back then everyone was okay with not having a say on who runs our country, but nowadays people want to be part of it and want to help decide and know that there opinion matters. With the Electoral College, the people don't make that decision, they choose electors to choose the president. It is not democratic and is also not fair or equal because only certain people are being heard. Eur choice as a whole should matter more than the electors. Richard A. Posner"" In 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes."" this is called the disaster factor and was the biggest election crisis in a century stated Bradford Plume. Let's take a moment and let this sink in.

Not only is this unfair but so many things can go wrong it. For example, the electors can always defy the will of people. Plume also stated"" back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.....

As you can see, nothing is forcing the electors to vote for their party's candidate, this method is putting the decision and our future in their hands.

1035,"I disagree that we must participate in a school activity that we might not even enjoy doing because we don't have to do something that we are not good at or generally, what the principal wants us to do. In every school, there are so many activities that you can do, but do you really have to do them? No, I don't believe so. Every student should decide on what they want to do. Not all students want to do activities that others want them to do. We should be heard instead of the principal or staff making all the decision that we may not agree on, like having to participate in school activities.

There are so many activities that we can do. Not all needs to be decided by the principal. Students should find a hobby or an activity that they think they are good at. Things out of school. Not everyone is perfect at doing a specific type of activity or sport. Every is different, no one will ever be the same as one another. They should choose something that they want to do, not what someone else picks for them. Let them see what they are good at and decide.

Other parents may find this upsetting. Some parents want their kids to join a sport or do different activities but what if there isn't any time for them. Most of these activities are after school and not everyone has time to do them. Other students have important things to do, and they just might be able to do any activity. Some parents don't want their kid stressed and if there are just many things for them to do. In after school activity or anything related to that, just might not be right for them to do. Other parents want their kids to do a sport or serve on the student council, but they might not realize how it can affect their kid. The same goes for the principal too. They said that all students must participate in at least one activity but what if they can't?

The principal should listen to students' opinions and what they want to do instead of having to do these activities that they told them to do. Every student has a right to state their own opinions and the principal should listen to them. If the students don't want to do the activities that the principal told them to do, he or she should listen to them. They all have their own reasons to why they decide to either do the activities or not. Maybe the school should listen to what they have to say. If it's important to them then it matters.

I believe that we should let the students decide on what they rather feel like doing. They should talk to the principal first. They should listen to what their students have to say. If they want to do an activity then they should. Hut if they decide that they don't want to have to do these activities, or they just can't do them, to talk to the principal. We should all do something that we would enjoy doing but if we just don't feel comfortable then we shouldn't.",0

1038,"The idea of having new and evolved vehicles might scare some people.

Having driveless cars has positive and negative sides to it.

Zrriveless cars are cars that drive themselves and don't need a human being to be behind the wheel.

The idea for having invented driverless cars is so that different types of people can multitask while they are in the car. Many people get distracted and need to become aware of what is happening in their surroundings.

While different people think that driverless cars are a bad thing there are some positives to the idea. Some positives are that you wouldn't have to worry about texting and driving or drinking and driving. You would get home safe and you wouldn't even have to touch the starting wheel.

Another positive is that it has sensors so that if your about to back up into and object it gives you a signal to inform you that you need to watch out, and the same with when you're driving, and you get really close to getting in an accident.

One last positive thing is that if you are tired or are in a condition in which you can not drive back to a certain place, he is driverless car can take you there.

There are negatives of having driverless cars as well. Not all driverless cars can and will do the exact same thing. Some negatives of having driverless cars is that not all the cars will be the same.

Another reason is that they might not be capable to do its job.

Another reason is that many people may not like the idea of driverless cars because they are so used to the idea of regular cars, and they like to be in control of where they are going and how they are driving.

One last reason as to why driverless cars are a negative thing is because the might be too expensive that not many people are willing to spend so much money.

There are also positives and negatives about regular cars.

Some people might be used to driving regular cars and don't want to change that. But because of all the technology that has been changing over the years if at one point driverless cars do not become something that everyone has some people might think that we are behind on our technological advances

I personal think that both types of cars are great if you want a driverless car then why shouldn't you be allow to have one but if you don't want a driverless car, and you like regular cars because you can control where you are going and how you are driving then that should be fine too. We just need to make sure that everyone n the rode whether you have a driverless car or a regular one are safe ",0
1039,"Many students say they would prefer to attend classes from home for a variety of reasons. Some people believe that attending classes from home is a bad idea because students would not have as many boundaries at home as they would at school. However, attending classes from home can improve mental health and it can be more one on one between the student and the teacher, which can improve the learning environment.

Distance learning can help improve the mental health of the students. Attending classes from home can improve mental health by reducing anxiety levels and placing the student in a less intimidating and stressful environment. When it comes to group projects, communicating with others, and public speaking anxiety levels in students may rise. Working from home will allow the student to stay calm and not have to deal with anxiety attacks. Distance learning allows a student to work in an area that they are comfortable in and already familiar with, which can make their environment less intimidating for them. Overall improving their mental health can also positively impact their grades.

In addition, video conferencing creates a one on one learning environment for the student. Being in a one on one learning environment can benefit the student because they will not be surrounded by other students or by their friends to get distracted. Many students get caught up in talking to other people or not being able to focus on the teacher because there are too many people talking around them, so they end up not being able to listen to the teacher's lesson. When its just the teacher and the student, the student may feel more comfortable talking to the teacher and asking questions. This is because when they are around other students they may feel like they will get made fun of or laughed at.

in conclusion, there are many advantages to distance learning. Attending classes from home can improve a students mental health which can lead to an overall improvement in their grades. As well as create a comfortable relationship between the teacher and student.",0
1040,"There was a time when cars were a new invention that everyone wanted or needed, but as of recent years cars have found themselves on the decline. There are many speculated reasons as to why people aren't as interested in getting a car and driving themselves around. One of the main theories seems to be that with new technological advancements are making carpools simple organize and knowing when and where the closest city bus will arrive easier to find out. Also, the technology of today makes it easy to contact and feel connected with your friends without having to go out and see them. Whatever the reason may be, the decline in car usage is a great advantage worldwide. The benefits of limited car usage are a better environment, less traffic stress, and healthier people.

Cars are the second most common source of air pollution in the United States. In Paris, cars were so heavily used that their pollution levels were near those of Beijing, China (known as one of the most polluted cities in the world). When Parisians heard this, they took action right away. They rotated day long bans on personal cars with even numbered license plates and odd numbered absence plates. After about a week of this rotating ban, with a few exceptions, the smog levels had lowered enough that all cars could be allowed again. Luckily, this experience made the people of Paris realize how much cars were harming their environment. Cars are a large source of carbon emissions all over the world so lessening their use is essential to reviving our hurting environment.

Another advantage to limiting the use of cars is less traffic and fewer accidents. Public transportation drivers are more skilled and practiced than everyday drivers. Arguably, they are safer behind the wheel than your average citizen. In addition to that, having less cars on the road makes it safer to walk, bike, skateboard, or even rollerblade to your destination. Also, fewer cars mean less traffic. Although on public transportation there are bus stops and such, traffic jams would be nearly eradicated if there were that many fewer cars on the road.

The last important advantage of having fewer cars is a personal health benefit. Driving can be seen as stressful. You have your life as well as the lives of people around you in your hands. Not only can the concept of driving itself be stressful, but things such as reckless drivers and heavy traffic are very hard for people to deal with patiently and safely. At would be better for people's emotional health to not have to deal with driving. Avoiding cars is also better for people's physical health in both cleaner environments and more physical activity. With the lessened levels of solution, as mentioned before, people would have cleaner air to breathe and a healthier environment to live in. The amount of physical activity in citizens would also increase. With people being able to walk, bike, skateboard, etc. to their desired destination the obesity numbers would decrease. Without cars, people's emotional and physical health would largely improve.

Overall, limiting the global use of cars would greatly benefit people worldwide. Due to the recent spread of the idea of being carefree and more conscious of our environment pollution levels are already decreasing. Advantages coming from a much needed decrease in car usage also include safer roads and less stressed, healthier people. A decline in the number of personal vehicles on the road would lead to a happier, safer, and healthier world.  ",0

1042,"Dear Principal,

Our school has recently been debating weather we should require all students to perform community service. I think that by requiring community service we would be helping not only the community but ourselves as well. We would be come more active, less selfish, and hopefully gain a better sense of moral. We also wouldn't just be helping ourselves but the people around us. They would feel better about where they live and who they live with/by. Making community service a school requirement would be a phenomenal idea.

Required community service would make the kids more active. Our free time is usually spent on some electronic lounging about. With community service we would be able to cut back on the gaming systems, movies, and over all laziness. We would be out cleaning the neighborhood, volunteering, and helping other people. We would become am

The kids in our school would by large become less selfish. We as children like to have everything we want and as we want. With community service we would be able to see how some people have so much less then we do. The word ""want"" would suddenly start to bring on a whole new meaning. Instead of saying "" I want that toy mommy!"", we would be able to say "" Mommy I want those people living in that homeless shelter to have a home again."" By being able to change the meaning of the word ""want"" we would have higher morals. We would think of someone else other than ourselves.

Requiring community service within our school would help promote the idea of selflessness. We would become a more active generation. We will have better and higher dreams for ourselves and our community. Our school should make community service a requirement.

1043,"Dear principle,

I think that we should keep it at a C average because Some people that play sports stay at the average to play, and if you made it a B average then they would have to go to practice and go home and study and not have enough time to study. Then when they take the test they had to study for they wouldn't UO so great on it them there average would go own.

Then they wouldn't have a lot of people to play sports. Sports keep us active and in shape. It keeps us healthy if, students couldn't play sports then kids wouldn't be so healthy we would all be fat, and I'm sure we on't want America like that. I think a lot of people struggle to make B averages. A lot of people can't learn quicker than others. Some people need time to go home and study not stay up all night have a test fail it. Not be able to play or be lazy for the game.

I would love for them to keep at a C average. C's aren't that hard to make if you try, but if you on't have a lot of time to study then there isn't many possible chances to make a B average. Not a lot of people make B's and A's. I would hate for you to make it a C average. I wouldn't like it at all. Then they wouldn't pay to play a school sport, then the schools would have any money from they parent paying.

Sports are for fun, and competitive. Something active to UO. Something that make a person happy. I'm sure you wouldn't want to take that away. I'm sure a lot of parents wouldn't be so happy for there child about this. The kit would be pressure to UO better, then they would be able to UO the sport, then they would get so caught up in it, they would fail at keeping there grade up then they wouldn't get to play their hobbies.

The sport they play could be something they want to be when they get older. They need lots of practice when they are younger to be a good player. This sport they play could be their carrier. Then they wouldn't have much of a chance to make it in a good collage they want to get in for there sport.

I would love for you to keep it at a C average, thanks.  ",0
1044,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" did a fair job at arguing their claim, that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author used their thesis, counter-arguements, and rebutals to get across their point that Venus is a worthwhile investment to study. Some areas they exceeded and others they did not hit right on the ball.

The author throughout the essay did not convey a very well stated thesis. Typically, a writer of an arguementative essay would feature their thesis openly, so that the reader is able to see what side the author is pushing forward. However, this author did not do this. The first paragraph introduces the topic of Venus with an interesting hook, but does not give the reader their side. The reader needs a thesis, without one the reader is not going to be able to have their opinion on a topic swayed. The author's current attempt at a thesis statement , ""While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved very challenging place to examine more closely,"" does not state what side they are on clearly. Their best declaration of the side they are on is in their very last paragraph. The author wrote, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This is a very strongly worded thesis, but would have been much better if placed in the starting paragraph. Their side on the topic was acknowledged, but not as well as it could have been if they had set up their thesis correctly.

Beyond the thesis, the author used many counter-arguements in their writing. This is one of their strong suits, acknowledging both sides of an arguement is one of the best ways to convey your opinion affectively, while still being able to keep opposing side of the arguement interested and have their minds open to change. The author is for the exploration of Venus, but consistently chooses to bring up the problems that doing so faces. The author writes about the difficulties about exploring Venus, because of the planet's extreme environment. They opposed their own side in paragraph three by saying, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" This is an affective strategy, because people who may oppose exploration to Venus may say something similar to this. The author is arguing their own point to establish reliability and trust amongst with people who favor not exploring Venus. The author showing that they see the problems with exploring Venus shows that they are open minded and open to their mind being changed, and this will in turn have the reader do the same.

Furthermore, the author was able to affectively state rebutals and reinforce their own opinion with facts. From the example stated earlier, regaurding the extreme conditions in Venus, the author was able to provide a logical solution to the weather without using any opinions. The author wrote,""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow sceintists to float above the fray."" The author then goes onto describe NASA's plan in full depth, and going into fine detail about the floating contraption that would suspend the astronauts safely above the harsh atmosphere of Venus. They then state, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" The author is displaying a solution for the conditions, and even the minor flaws it has. The author going into detail about the solution for the extreme conditions in Venus and even conceding a bit when saying, ""Not easy conditions but survivable for humans,"" helps argue their point. They affectively refuted the counter-arguements by using factual evidence in their rebutal, and deemed themselves trustworthy by the opposing side by even conceding slightly on a few issues.

The author of ""The Callenge of Exploring Venus"" did a fair job when arguing that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. While the author did accurately present the dangers and solutions for the dangerous parts of exploring Venus, they failed to create a strong thesis. The author exceeded when giving factual information about the topic to help the reading get on their side of the arguement; do to them struggling to get across their position on if Venus exploration is worthwhile, some of the provided information they gave was not used to it's full potential when changing the reader's opinion.",0

Why do most people agree with his quote, there could be many reasons? My reason to agree with Ralph's quote is because people can see the real you when being yourself. Not being yourself around your family, friends, and other people could make you feel less confident about yourself or your actions. Pretending can make you feel guilty, it could make you feel like you're lying to someone about yourself, so think about it.

When Students learn at home there are lens distraction that can Stray the child away from the tank at hand. Overall learning from home can be very beneficial if it in done the right way, and with the right amount of Strictness and regulation.

Every Student can benefit from more Sleep, because Mont do not Meet enough Sleep an it in. Almost every School System obligated Students to wake up Somewhat early to attend School. Mont likely Students do not want to be there because they are extremely exhausted. Some Students are detrimentally tired that they feel like they have no other choice but to Sleep in clan. That in where learning from home in beneficial, because Students can attend clan online or by video conferencing on their own time. It make Nit convenient for Students to actually complete School work. If Students are well rented they are usually much more efficient than when they are Sleep deprived.

We all know that there are different emotions going are the school. The different types of emotions that are commonly at a school are happy, mad, sad, bored, or even neutral.

MONTH_DAY_YEAR

I am writing this letter to you today to let you know I strongly believe that we should demolish the process of electoral college. Why you may ask? First, it is unfair, we are the votes they not. Second, it is outdated (
""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plume

) Lastly,

First, it is not fair. We the people are supposed to choose the president not some private party that we never meet. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plume ;according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- for the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to kind we have now."" So we vote yes, but he doesn't become president; do we even matter? It doesn't seem like it.

Second of all, it is very outdated. According to ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by The Office of the Federal Register this process was founded in the days of the four founding fathers. That's old! Now in days we have found better and fair ways to do pretty much every thing.

I hope this letter helps you decide on weather or not we should keep the process of electoral college.

You may do everything in your power to be a safe driver, but there will always be other people on the road not paying attention and cause a crash that you can't prevent. Walking where you need to go is the safest way to get around. You don't have to worry about car crashes or worrying over your families safety.

Another example of the advantages of listing car usage in passage one is, not hearing the screeching sound of car motors or tires flying by. Instead of hearing the familiar sounds of cars passing by you hear the joyful sound of children wandering around or riding their bicycles. People find it more calming to hear the sound of a child enjoying themselves instead of hearing the roaring and dealing sound of vehicles going by. When people are at home trying to relax they do not want to hear loud noises through their neighborhood. That's supposed to be their winding downtime to escape from everything. Without vehicles people would be a lot calmer, and relaxed.

The last example came from the second passage. It states that there is a major decrease in air pollution in Paris as they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. One day they ordered people with even number license plates to leave their cars parked or suffer having to pay a fine. In the text it states that, ""Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and Twenty seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine."" With this being done congestion was down sixty percent in the capitol of France. By them taking control they reduced the amount of air pollution in Paris.

By limiting the usage of vehicles we make people a lot happier and safer, you don't hear the annoying sounds of cars screeching by, and last but not the least air pollution is decreased in a huge amount.",0
1051,"DEAR, Senator

Changing the electoral college would not be a great idea due to the fact that it has been around for centuries and would negatively impact the voting system. Some believe the voting system is a very unfair and outdated system because of the electoral college. When changing the system to popular vote it will affect many people, it maw also come out worse than the electoral college. 3 big points WHW the electoral college should saw the same is one because the electoral college has been around keeping voting in place for centuries. The second great point is that a disaster only happened once. Then the third main point is the winner take all idea is a great idea for the electoral college.

The electoral college has been around forever so WHW change it now. Some believe that the electoral college is a good idea Because of the voting was in the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. Which is good because people need to have a leader of there state and that leader shows them which president is really good for what Theo do. Presidents talk about what Theo are going to do to help the country and the slate electors define what the presidents are going to do to help out that certain state. Then the people of the state vote there slate electors for good reasons. The electoral system should saw around a lot longer the system is just right for voting.

The electoral college is in good shape for stating and not changing a disaster only happened once 14 wears ago back in 2000. That means at least 3 elections happened since then and nothing went wrong. Even though if the electoral college system is such a good system then WHW was there such confusion in th200 fiasco. That makes the electoral college system look very bad because it can keep it's voting in balance at all. This was only once, If the system changes then this could happen more than many more times. Then soon we won't even know which president wins the election.

The electoral college looks really good due to the ""winnertakeall""

Swstem which awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. Some saw this is far, but others believe the ""proportional representation"" system, the system that the state governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"", which list all the candidates who ran for president in the state along with the names of their respective electors.

In overall the electoral college should saw due to the fact that the electoral college has been around keeping voting in place for centuries, a disaster only happened once and finally is the winner take all idea is a great idea for the electoral college.  So let's not try new stuff keep the electoral college.

1052,"In some Schools not only do teacher's assist student's but now student's beginning do the same for younger one's at School. Some Schools have program's that teacher's allow student's to pair up with younger one's at the Elementary School's. In this program student's do Have's read book's and so much more exiting activities. They do this to help out younger students that are just beginning school and are scared and don't know what to do in School or how to react because of their first time band in School. The older student's assist out the younger one's on how to read, comprehend and to He the understanding of how books are read and what they could be used for in their future life, this is the reason older students are so helpful and useful.

Another amazing this program is useful is because for those students that are home alone and have no older brother's or sister's, this program helps them He a understanding of how it feels having sibling's at home. This program entertains and not only that but also influence's younger student's on how it feels having a sibling at home and the amazing time spend with each other as well. I think this is a wonderful and interesting idea because it interests kids and makes them want to return to School and love School if they are having second thoughts about School, for example if they do not like it and don't want to return, having a buddy might want to change their mind because they can only imagine the fun and exiting time they can have with their buddy!

Teachers's, Principal's and other members like the School bored did a smart plan of creating this fantastic program of older student's assisting out the younger student's and teaching them a thing or two about certain things. Younger student's look up to the older student's and the older students are known as role models because they are much more mature and that is why younger ones look up to them. The reason why this program is helpful for both younger and older student's is because this program impacts both younger and older student's, it impacts the younger ones because it teaches them how to read and write, and it impacts the older student's because they learn how to assist younger ones and how to communicate with them. This Great program will help out student's right now in class, and also they will learn how to use these skills in a daily life and maybe on their everyday lifestyle and job's.

When a student or any person assist out another, at the end they will always feel proud about their self's, and they will want to keep on helping others in their daily life. That is why they might have this program, so student's can He the feeling of how it feels helping out someone and so the younger student's can learn how to read and He the feeling of how is the sensation would feel if they had sibling's at home. They might fight but at the end they will later than respect each other, and they will learn how to communicate with each other. School is important because student's learn from their mistakes and then next time the same problems happen to them, they will learn from it and make it better than the first time. They learn and learn so when a student is a fully Brown adult they know what is expected of them and how to assist other's if needed also they will be more mature and will know how to act. If someone is out their struggling or having a difficulty time doing something, the adult that was ones a student and helped out younger student's will automatically know what to do and how to help the one's that will need help. This is the reason this program is so helpful, and I hope they keep having these things for student's in the past and will continue to help them in the future.",0
1053,"Driverless car, we have talked about driverless car for years and now that there here people are special. Driverless car they car cool that are a good form of public transportation. Why you may ask because drunken drivers now don't have to spend money on a cab, so instead they just drive drunk and sometimes IBB people in car wrecks with the new technology this Webb be no problem you might say but on the her hand this car are going to be expensive for the average human to buy.

Some other issues are the computers so people are scared that he computer in the car Webb be Abel to get hacked or it Webb shut off when you're driving and you could wreck there are many ways that he computer could mess up so that is also a dangerous part of having a car that drives its self. There are some other great features that the car Webb have such as the traffic jam feature that Webb have heads up displays around the cart ebbing you when you're going to have to take over the car and drive it your self. The car also watches you and he rode so that the car always knows if you're ready to take the wheel or not.

Although it is began to drive a computer operated cars or even test them states bike California, Nevada, Florida and the District of Columbia are beading the United States in est self driving car manufactures such as BMW, Tesla and gm have tested self driving car, also Google is testing self driving car. Also in 2016 Tesla released a driving car that can drive on autopilot 90% of the time.

This is a huge step in making the roads safer it could help with drunken drivers it can make where there is Bess wrecks it is an ABB around better way to drive on the road. There is the other side of things people who are afraid of the computer cont robbing where they wreck or not and there is also people who just enjoy to drive and go on these Sunday cruises and be incontrobb of their car not having the car drive them but them drive the car. I'm more on there side of that is makes the roads safer so we should mass build them and make them at a cheap price where every one can get one.  ",0
1054,"Around the world, citites are getting improved by reducing the usage of cars. With the new ways of transportation such as bike, foot, car-pool and public transportation (bus, train, taxi) there has been many great out comes. Many people should join in on this limiting of car usage. It saves time, conserves resources, lowers emmisions and improves safety. Many citites, such as Vauban, Paris and Bogota have taken steps to creating a car free community.

In Vauban, Germany many residents of this community dont even own a car. The people are allowed to own a car but they have two options of parking that result in buying a space or a home with a space. With this great cost of spaces, up to 70 percent of the families do not own a car. Many people living this life style are very happy with not owning a car. Heidrun Walter thought that ""when [she] had a car [she] was always tense. [And she] is much happier this way"". It was proven that 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe is from passenger cars. The idea of a ""car reduced"" community is very appealing to many people and is starting to spread to many locations.

The ban of driving has also spread to Paris. Paris started off by banning any motorists with an even-numbered license plate, and the following day the same would apply to the odd-numbered plates. There was a descrease of congestion by 60 percent. France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline, which lead to the blame of diesel for the intensifying smog in the city. Around 67 percent of the vehicles in France are diesel  compared to the 53 percent average of diesel engines in the first of Western Europe. With just the few short carless days, the smog cleared from the city and the ban was rescined a day after.

There are also traditions such as ""Car-free day"" in Bogota, Colombia. On this day, car owners leave their cars at home and turn to hiking, biking, skating or bus taking. The main goal for this day is to promote alternative transportation and reduce the smog. Many people join in, resulting in a very large turn out, saying that ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". It is thought that the people participating in this event are ""generating a revolutionary change"" . Not only has this day helped to decrease the pollution and smog in the city, it has brought improvements to the city. There has been a restriction on rush-hour which leads to the cut in traffic, sidewalks are being replaced, parks and sports centers are blooming throughtout the city and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

These different ways of limiting car usage have also spread to the United States. President Obama has large goals to ""curn the United States' greenhouse gas emmisions"". Recent studies have shown that Americans are buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses as the years go by. There has also been a reduced amount of car ownership per household. Many sociologists believe it will have ""beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" with transportation being the second largest source of the United States emissions. In a span of nine years, a study found that driving by young people had decreased 23 perecent. Discussions at the Mobile World Congress lead to a plan for a world where personal vehicle ownership it impractical or undesirable.

Many citites in the world are starting to see the damage cars can do to the environment and also how wonderful and stress-free life can be withouth them. Many new ides are being started to reduce the car usage everywhere. Most people agree with these ideas, most even find them beneficial. There are many advantages of limiting car usage and it seems many people have found these advantages which has resulted to the decrease of car culture everywhere.",0

Luke and Don signed up to go on the ship to Europe. They had to be ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

1056,"Dear,

Senator of Florida is sent you this letter to tell you why we need to keep things the way they are. Electoral college is a process in which we decide who will be our President of the United States of America. During this process the Electoral College consist of 538 electors in which 270 of those electoral votes is required to elect the President. During this presidential election you vote for you candidate but what your actually doing is voting for your candidate's electors. Although the electoral colleges have things wrong with it, they do have some positive things that counter the negative out. Like certainty of an outcome, avoiding run-off election, you have to have trans-regional appeal(everyone's President), Swing states, and Big states.

A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 200-but It's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. Winning candidate's share the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular vote cast for him and Romney.... Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner- take-all basis. A nationwide electoral vote is possible because 538 is an even number, but It's highly unlikely. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012's election to focus more on toss-up states. As the people of these states are very thoughtful in deciding who they will pick because they are the people that pay close attention to the campaign.

The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anarchism. People believe that it should be changed to who ever gets the most popular votes. People only believe it should be changed because of what has happened in the past with other elections. Like what happened in 200,1960 segregationists in the legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors, and the worst being that it ends up in a tie. Things have happened in the past.

We don't need to change because of things that happened in 2000 or 1960. Its 2015 and we don't need a change to our way of deciding the president. There's no reason to changing it to popular vote.  ",0
1057,"The enigma of summer projects. The summertime is a great time to learn something new and prepare for upcoming classes. Schools that offer summer projects to students should be designed by teachers, because they know best what they need to prepare their students for. Students who are motivated into taking the class, will do their required work. It shows that students who do not, should not take the class. Many classes that are assigned summer projects are college level classes and need the extra studying to proceed. Students should know what they are getting themselves into. Teachers would also have to grade the summer projects consistent. In fact, grading over hundreds of students papers is tiring but rewarding to learn students comprehensibility. Imagine it being student-based work, where the teacher would have no rubric to keep constant grades.

First, the students who choose to take the class. Depending on the class, there maybe limited seats available for students. For example, Psychology is a very popular class and only students with certain grades can take it as it is a limited seated class. Assigning teacher-based summer assignments could test students who actually want to take the class. That the class is not an easy A. Students who complete the project are expected to earn their spot. This makes the teachers teaching experience a bit easier, as they know what type of students they are getting.

Furthermore, the difficulty of the class. Depending on the level whether it is an advanced placement, college level class, or honor class; it is expected to study over the summer. Teachers make the best choices for their students especially on their summer projects. Teachers are informed of any changes made to the curriculum, this is crucial in college classes as the exam is very specific. For example, the College Board could decide to exclude a part of the exam, or add in new modules. The exams are constantly getting updated and teachers could use the summer projects as the best time to include new information the board has decided to add.

In addition, the rubric will be kept the same. This benefits both parties as for teachers they know exactly what answers they are looking for, and this would make grading hundreds of papers more efficient. For example, multiple students may have gotten a certain question incorrect, the teacher could then discuss the answer and overall deal with any confusion. For students, getting an answer wrong could allow them to reach out to another for the correct answer and solve questions together. Improving team work and social skills.

All in all, teacher-based summer projects are easier to grade. It tests students their dedication to the class and the level of understanding. It excludes any students who assume the class is easy or simply do not do their work. There are no shortcuts to complete the teachers project. Just like how there are no shortcuts in life. It also shows that students must be prepared for class beforehand and take responsibility. Especially goes for college level classes as changes are inevitable. ",0
1058,"Should the Electoral College be removed? Tats been the arguments, talks, and thoughts over many years. If they we're to ask me, I would absolutely say ""Yes The Electoral College should be removed."" But many people ask ""way?"", to me, it's simple. All the votes that ""U.S. Citizens"" make every four years, never really goes directly to the runners for presidents. They always go to people who decide weather or not they should be approved, wick obviously the should if their whole or the majority of the state voted for him/her. But tats not what txe feel, they feel like they need to prove the runners. ""Wxy?"", you ask? I'm not sure. If they need to do all that, way don't the people of the House of Representatives just make their decisions? Since it always comes down to them, then their's no point of the U.S. Citizens voting for president. But then again, I feel like way should they choose who is the president? If the whole USA are the one's who need to worry about the president.",0
1059,"My friend Brenna thinks that the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars."" was done by aliens, but the other hand I don't think it was. The first photos look like an alien, but they were taken long ago, but the pictures today are way sharper and shows us more detail about them. On paragraph 7 it states, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia for the first time, Michael Main and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL website, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all""(Unmasking the Face on Mars, paragraph 7). Basically it was just a landform that looks like a face.

Also, the article states that the weird looking mask looks like landforms common around the American West, it states on paragraph 12, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American west""(Unmasking the Face on Mars, paragraph 12).

Brenna states from paragraph 5,"" Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA

Would rather hide, say conspiracy theorist""(Unmasking the Face on Mars, paragraph 5).

But you have to think about the citizens, would you really want to know if aliens do exist or not? Not knowing is stress-free and just makes the world a better place. But if you know you'd freak out every day of your life thinking aliens can come down any day now. Not knowing everything is a good thing sometimes and not knowing what NASA is hiding is a good example.

So knowing that the pictures they have are real pictures, it is a landform. My text evidence in my first three paragraphs will give you the reasons why ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" is a landform and not a face.  ",0
1060,"What do I think about driverless cars? I think they should But a stop to this whole new idea. It's a waste of time and not only a waste of time but I think that there's nothing wrong with the vehicles we have now and making them more advanced doesn't make them a good or better car and Some People think this idea is a good one I disagree and this is why.

Why would you want some man made thing ""helping"" you or driving your car for you? Some People buy cars just so they can be able to drive teasels Places if not they would take a bus, buses have other People drive other People Places. Plus, this new idea is a very bad one. It sounds to me like a death trade like how could you have a machine drive itself. It doesn't have eyes that can see what's going on in the road? I do not believe in a computer to aerate my car for me. How would you feel safe if you're not the one in control the whole time. I wouldn't want to ride or drive in a car that I'm not the one in control its different want it's an actual Person verse a computer.

What if you get into an accident with another car whose fault is it? Yours or the cars or the computer aerating the car and if it hits another vehicle that is driving itself who's fault, is it? It could be many situations. Another reason why I do not agree with this ""driverless cars"" is that they are Saying money for this driver less cars when it still needs a driver but only sometimes. You have to wait til it's your turn or something? Dr. Werner Huber says ""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" the way cars are made now are fine, why would People want to change it UE? Making cars more advanced might seem like a good idea but it's not. They said"" something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell Phone"" or even when People want to talk on the Phone we already have a safe way of doing it. Some cars already have where you can connected your Phone to your car with Bluetooth. That way People can talk and drive while still staying safe and looking at the road the whole time.

Lastley I want to talk about is after they make this driverless vehicles are they going to do away with other vehicles? How many People are going to actual want a computer driving there car for them. I think People are wasting there time and money on something that seems to be just a danger to any and all People and not even just People everything around. Paragraph 10 states"" automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the Problems ahead will be solved."" i home all this time and money they are sending is worth it all. They are going to be not only be getting money from People who do decide to actually invest in this idea, but they are just going to lose business.

In conclusion, what do you think about driverless vehicles? Should they keep going on with this amazing idea they think they might have or should they just stop what they are doing and quit wasting time on this when they can be making something else more useful? I think they should stop now because it's just going to lead to more Problems and more injured People.  ",0

1063,"In May 1976, a spaceship that was looking for a landing site on Mars snapped a very interesting photo. The blurry photo clearly resembled a human face. The picture led a lot of people to think that the structure was build by aliens. However, this statement has been proven wrong by scientific evidence. The structure wasn't built by aliens because a more up-to-date photo of the same spot has proven that it is just a mass of rock.

Up until around 1998, a large amount of people believed that the image of the blurry face was evidence of an alien civilization. In April 5, 1998, however, scientists were finally ale to take another picture of the same spot with more up-to-date technology. The new image revealed that it was just a bunch of rocks.

Scientists say that the blurry face could've been caused by a thick haze that was on that part of the planet when the original photo was taken. They said it was a cloudy day when the photo was taken, so the FAE could've been created by the combination of the clouds and the shadows.

Now that a more up-to-date photo was released, some people have dropped the whole idea of an alien civilization, however, some people still believe that there could still be alien life elsewhere. This could be true, but as for the blurry face photo, it was all just a trick of the eye.",0
1064,"Deal senator, if I may speak for the people I think that the Electoral College was a great idea thanks to the founding fathers. The concept of every state in the United States of America and the people in the states have the power and decision over closing the commander and chief. The fact that the founding father created the Constitution and the amendments is light Because look at where we have today in history. The US is so strong and civilized Because of the Constitution it keeps us heading in the light direction. Back to the keeping the Electoral College and its voting system.

The light to vote is a great power and acknowledgement. The people go to vote, and then the state counts the votes and which even candidate gets the most votes believes the electoral votes which is separated Between the states. This is a goat thing Because every light full human Being has a chance to make a difference. If the winning candidate was only chosen for popular votes then it would EE uneven and unfair then Moody would want to vote. Don't you think MV of miss senator that if the founding fathers thought about this many years ago, and they saw us today they would say what a great idea and concept we came up with. The founding fathers thought about the light of the people and that's what counts.

The Electoral College is a smart way to give the people there light to vote and chose who will make things Better. The candidate has to appeal to the people as the light guy to run the United States and can help improve the economy. The electoral college is not to make things have it is to make things light and even for everyone. Some states have little populations, so they get less electoral votes compared to others states with huge populations they get move electoral votes because they have move people voting which is fair for everyone. In the end the Electoral College is an efficient and non problematic solution to voting for a president of candidate.

The other fact is that the Electoral College provides a certain winner. The candidates have to go out and speak with the people and explain what they want to change and improve in the United States. The candidate have to prove they have worthy and capable of creating an Better tomorrow. For example Barack Obama has created millions of move does for people and has Brought up out economy. Since the cash in the economy he has done an amazing Joe in creating an Better tomorrow for the people. How did Obama win well it's the cause of the popular vote of the state and then which every person votes and then the winner get the electoral votes of the state that is 538 divides Between the states. The people did there Joe in listening and watching the candidates and how they can make us stronger. MV of miss senator I would like you to think how would you feel if the where a founding father and what would you want the US to EE like in the future and how you can active that and the peoples light.

The facts ave all have the founding fathers and how they came up with this idea and the diddle even know what would EE the outcome But in the end the light to vote and how every single human Being makes a difference in closing the president of the United States and commander and chief makes every person valuable to tomorrows outcome. My honest opinion MV of miss senator is that we should keep the Electoral college because it is Eased on peoples light which is most important and that why the constitution is Eased on the peoples light. The amendments where thought up as just an idea on a paper and when we make it a concept in the United States Government it makes us the people who and what we have today.

1065,"Schools shouldn't force students to do extracurricular activities because that can induce stress and not have time to send with your family. On the other hand some Doodle believe it's better in order for students to be academically inclined to do well in school.

Having students forced into extracurricular activities can lead to stress which can eventually impact students negatively. Negative stress can lead to failing classes, bad house habits and suicide.

For example stress leading to class failing can really have a big impact on a students' life if they have to repeat a grade, it can Possibly make it harder for them to graduate and even find a stable job. So if these bad impacts Hadden then society might just Perish due to stress given off by forced extracurricular activities. Stress really can lead up to fatal consequences if there's enough stress going around because of forced extracurricular activities. People usually do well if there is nothing that stresses them out but with forced extracurricular activities the stress will double and even triple in the size it was mentally beforehand. Forced extracurricular activities can also lead up to times Dent with family decrease.

Forced extracurricular activities could take a significant amount of family time away impacting the students relationship with their family and those around. This could make a stable family unstable and make them often argue because the student isn't on the same Age as the family due to family time loss from going to the forced extracurricular activity after school. This can also impact a students mental and emotional health for example there are many students with elderly Doodle whom they cherish, they might have little time to live so time with them can have a major impact on their emotional health. But if time when taken away these students won't send the amount of time they need with the elderly to be emotionally stable since the elderly might die any day. If this hardens students might learn to associate school with bad things that keep you away from those whom you cherish deeply.

Forced extracurricular activities shouldn't exist due to reasons like stress and family time loss, which can mentally, emotionally and academically affect students due to extracurricular activities. This is why forced extracurricular activities shouldn't ever surface in this beautiful country we know as The United States.",0

1067,"As a student, I strongly, wholeheartedly disagree with this decision. The idea of forcing kids into an extracurricular activity is absurd and unreasonable. The principal, who is supposed to be the 'leader' of the school, forcing everyone to do something they don't want to do is a dictatorlike move. Dere's an example for you: Let's say Dictator Kim Jon UN decides everyone in North Korea has to stay after work for an hour to paint portraits of him. Sure, a portion of people may enjoy painting, but overall everyone is going to loathe the extra hour because they don't want to do it. That's exactly what you're doing. Now here's why you should never choose to do this to students.

First, students have tons of responsibilities. Besides working hard at school five days a week, students have to do homework and study for tests, for seven classes! They also have chores at home that their parents need them to do, in order to keep the house clean and functioning. Many students even have to work to support their families, even after doing all the other responsibilities I mentioned previously. It's just not fair that you would force them into something else. Older students may be tasked with taking care of a pet or younger sibling, having to come right home after school and being busy all afternoon and evening.

Keep in mind, these are just a mere glance at the responsibilities they have to do every single day after school. Do we really need to burden these children with something else?

Parents of students may not want their child to stay after school. Students may not be able to get a ride home due to their parents working or lack of buses. This would inconvenience everyone. Students have extracurricular activities outside of school as well, and others have a tight schedule that would crush them if they had to cram one more thing in. Requiring them to do an extracurricular activity would be the straw that broke the camel's back.

I personally don't think the principal has a right to do such a thing. You cannot keep students after school against their will. Once the bell rings at the end of the day, and they leave campus, you don't get to control them anymore. Forcing ever single student to participate in an extracurricular activity is despicable; you are forcing everyone to do something against their own will. You may think that you're ""helping"" them by giving them a light push, and you're not completely wrong. Not every student is going to loathe going to an activity, but let me tell you, should you do this, there are going to be kids who will suffer.

I also believe, and many would agree, students should want to participate in extracurricular actives. I know how it feels to be forced to do an extracurricular I didn't want to do, and I was miserable. Throughout the entire school day there was a pit of dread in my stomach that wouldn't go away, until I was finally free from the prison they called an ""extracurricular."" I had zero interest in it, and after it ended it discouraged me to try out other activities. To this day I still struggle with trying new things, all because of that one bad experience brought upon me by people like you, people with the power to make decisions for me.

I know that this essay is not going to completely change your perspective. This is one paper, it's not that significant. You may read dozens of other papers with completely different ideas. Though, I at least want you to think about how the decisions you make affect those around you. Think about the prompt I've been given. Imagine you were the principal. What decision would you have made before reading this essay? What about after? Was I, a child, able to change your mind?

If I was, or you agreed with me from the start, I'm glad that my words hold meaning and have power, because it's something I lack. If I wasn't, and had you been the principal, you would've chosen to force every single student to do an extracurricular, I just hope you know that not only have you wasted my time, but your time. My objective was to convince you otherwise, and get you on my side. Though, whatever your stance on this is, on my side or not, just know that you have the power. No matter how many papers I write, no matter how many points I make, in the end, you will get to choose for me. So think twice before you make decisions like that where you get to choose for others. Think about what else is going on in their lives; all the other things they have to do. If you got nothing else out of this essay, I at least hope you got that, because at the end of the day, you will get the final say, because you are the adult. ",0

With this, students have new started TF take classes Online instead Ff in the classroom. Some think that it is a terrible idea and Others believe it's a great idea. Students should NFT be allowed TF take classes Online at home because it is proven that people can remember better when writing with a piece Ff paper and pencil, students will likely cheat, it's harder TF find help and ask questions, and getting taught by teachers is much more helpful than teaching yourself.

Students would benefit more by going TF school and learning in person because it is known that writing information down with a pen For pencil, FN a sheet Ff paper, can stick in your memory much better than typing Online. Distance learning would limit this and have kids NFT remember necessary knowledge as much. Though kids might get higher grades FN a Online course, there is a high chance that they didn't completely learn the material. Physically writing something down is much better FFF then typing something. Our world is evolving every day, SF sadly technology will likely take Over and this will likely end up NFT just being an Option, but rather a necessity.

Though cheating is prohibited in every school, students still have the urge TF copy FFF somebody else's work. Having this, if students started taking Online classes more, a high percentage Ff these students would decide TF be better FFF cheating and getting a high grade. Since the class would be Online, students would find it easier TF cheat by searching FFR answers Online, instead Ff studying and trying TF learn the subject. If a student was TF be in a classroom with an adult teacher watching, he wouldn't cheat and know he'd have TF study and learn the information in Order TF succeed. This is a major point because if students started TF take Online classes more instead Ff regular classes, they could end up NFT really learning anything and have a hard time succeeding in the real world. Though many students might NFT know, if they choose TF cheat their way Fut Ff school, life is going TF come hitting hard.

Many students DFN't get a certain subject and need help TF process and gain that knowledge. If students were TF take a class Online, For with video conferencing, their would be less people they could ask questions TFF. Though video conferencing would give a student someone TF ask questions, that would really be their Only easy source Ff help. Asking questions is very critical FFR a student TF DF. If a student wants TF learn then he/she will ask questions TF a grown up that can help. Say a young by was taking a Online class, and he had NF idea what he was trying TF DF. If he isn't video conferencing, but is taking the class Online, who would he is able TF ask FFR help? If his parents DFN't know how TF help, what would that student DF TF get free help? The main point is that it would be harder FFR a student TF ask questions if they were taking a Online class.

These students are very young and inexperienced. At school, students would learn from experienced adults and be able TF get help almost anytime they need it. Though many students could end up being better FFF teaching themselves, having information spoken and explained TF the students would increase the chances Ff them memorizing that information. It has been proven that getting taught from Others is better than teaching yourself. If a student is getting taught by a teacher in person, they can learn FFF someone else's perspective. Learning from an experienced grown up would be much better FFF FN the fact that they know what they are talking about and can help with everything that student needs help with.

Students would benefit more from learning at school instead Ff taking classes Online because using a pen For pencil helps remember information easier, cheaters, and harder TF ask people questions.

1072,"Phones and Driving

Lives of loved ones are lost each day. There are many possible events that can contribute to one's death, and distracted driving is too often one of these causes. Phones are used for communication and benefit our lifestyle, but they have also become a major issue while driving. Although, many people know that there are severe consequences to being a distracted driver, they still do it. Driving is a big responsibility and it should be taking very serious. Texting is the main reason as to why people check their phones in the first place, and it keeps getting worse.

Many companies and programs have encouraged people to drive as safe as possible. Many fail to perceive that teens are the largest group involved in car accidents. Teenagers involved in a car accident make careless mistakes like using their phones, and endanger their life. People don't comprehend that using cellular devices while driving is taking very serious by the law. It is a crime and will have serious consequences held against you. The use of cell phones should not be allowed while driving.

The consequences of texting and driving can be fatal. Many believe that texting and driving isn't a big problem and that they are able to handle multitasking. According to Snyder and Associates, atleast 660,000 drivers attempt to use their phone while being behind the wheel. It is very tempting to answer a text or a call while driving, but you should be aware of all the safety risks that come with making that decision. Most states have passed laws to make texting and driving illegal. Although most of the US has made an effort to persuade people to drive safely and avoid texting while driving, The National Safety Council reported that approximately 1.6 million car crashes are due to the use of cell phones. Lives of many are lost prematurely because of drivers who make the wrong decision and choose to text and drive. How many more lives have to be lost in order for people to understand that a text can wait?

Teenagers are the main and largest group that are implicated in consequential car accidents. According to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute, distractions are one of the main ""critical errors"" that lead to teens crashing. Teenagers who are new to driving don't have as much knowledge as an experienced driver. Taking their eyes off the road and checking their phones is a common and dangerous mistake that many make. Most adolescents know the consequences of being distracted while driving. As reported by Edgar Snyder and Associates, 56% of teen drivers admit to talking on the phone while driving, and 13% admitted to texting and driving. Being behind the wheel is a big responsibility. The driver not only has to think about being safe they have to think about avoiding any fatal injuries to themselves and/or others.

No state completely bans the use of cell phones for everyone completely. According to

Governors Highway Safety Association, 38 states ban the use of cell phones for teen drivers, and 21 states as well as D.C. prohibit cell phone use for bus drivers completely. Utilizing phones behind the wheel has serious a serious outcome. Premature death is one of the many results of drivers being distracted. There are consequences for those who break any type of law, and breaking driving laws is not an exception. Traffic citations, fines, loss of license, and/or jail are a few of the many consequences. Fines and jail time may increase if the incident keeps happening, if the driver is drunk, or if the driver or any other passenger is injured.

The person behind the wheel is accountable for getting to places safe. Driving is a big responsibility and should be taken extremely serious. Drivers need to understand that to get to a destination it is a must for you to follow the safety rules. Distracting driving is something that can be changed. There is no need for people to die and their families to suffer, because a person is driving carelessly. Be responsible.   ",0
1073,"Computers are something of the present, and man-kind is hoping for more efficient computers in the future. More and more lately students are being assigned a computer of their own supplied by the school. Sometimes these computers are used for bad but mostly good. The Facial Action Coding System could be helpful for furthering academics in school corporations and could be used to help state testing which has just recently been switched to online.

The Facial Action Coding System is something that school should invest in. It should not become something that everyone needs to have because some schools cannot even afford books! For the schools that can afford this program it could be made beneficial many ways. For example, many students become tired using their computers, so if the computer reads the child is becoming tired it could offer an academic game or a brain-teaser to make the child more lively. The article states,"" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Huang predicts.' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' "" This program can also read happiness and sadness. Some students suffer from depression and have thoughts of suicide. This program could notify the teacher or counselor if the student is continuously sad or angry. This could help prevent things such as school shootings, self mutilation, or even suicide.

Some people may argue this program is taking away from a teachers job or it could be used for the wrong things. Technology has taken the load off of teachers in the last ten years, but it has also caused some harm. With technology comes the problems of students not having their computers charged, money shortages, and things breaking. Those things have distracted from students learning. In the big picture, do the pros outweigh the cons?

In the overall outlook on furthering a student's computer's capability using this program is the better option. Everything comes with problems. It does add something more to a teachers plate, but it also helps a teacher make a connection with the student. The Facial Action Coding system is beneficial and should be considered by school corporations around the world. ",0

Does reasons are : certainty of outcome, Everyone's president, and swing states.

Problems over Electoral college is possible but not as much as problems over popular vote. ""The reason is that winning candidate's share of the winning candidate's share of the Electoral college invariably exceeds his share of popular vote"". This also benefits small states.

Candidates most of the time choose to focused more on the tossup states because they are ""the most thoughtful voters and should be the ones to decide the election"".

""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor"". People are worried that the government will choose for them. They do not realize that if we don't have the electoral college than that is more than likely to happen because the electoral college is what allows us to have a voice, a say, in what we want in our future president.

Another reason that the author wrote in the text was in paragraph 2 it states, ""After referred to as Earth's 'Twin,' Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" This shows me that when we are able to get over to this planet we will be able to see 'what is over on that side of the river'. Meaning that we will be able to see what the closest looking planet to earth is really about. The third and final reason the author wrote about in the passage was written in paragraph three as it stated,"" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.'

If you have good for you but not all people need or want to help the community. I think that we should leave community service up to the volunteer and people who got sent to community service by law. Instead of having everybody do it at the school. You could have everybody that get in trouble do it AF a punishment. Why would you have everybody do it when you could have people that want to do it for there if no complaining. I think that if their if complaining there will be fighting and that will just cause trouble. Not everyone want to do community service for only have the people that want to do it help the community or else everyone else if going to complain and not follow the rule for there would be more people getting in trouble. When more people get in trouble the schools rating will go down and left people will go to that school for do you really want that? I'm guessing not especially if you the principal. So only have the people that want to do it for there are left fifth and the school rating doesn't go down.

For most people that form of transportation is a car.

Cars are used not only as transportation but are also used for recreation and competition.

Self driving cars MAL take away from the recreation and competition parts and make the hobbies of many people become nonexistent.

One could argue that roads would be safer with cars capable of driving themselves, but the reality is a computer is no replacement for a human brain.

A computer with all the little circuits and fuses it has is not able to make a decision that solves problems beyond the one it is currently faced with.

Therefore, car accidents will still occur and when an accident does occur who is to be held accountable?

Who will pal the cost of the damage? ""Who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer?""(paragraph 9)

One cannot simply Sal that the dumbest car is the one to blame.

Nor can he or she Sal that the drivers are at fault if the had no control over their car.

Driving can also be used as an escape.

Some people race their cars as a hobby and others just enjoy a nice Sunday cruise around town.

Either was the are not driving so the will not find the refuge from doctoral life the seek.

What would be the fun of going to a track and sitting in a car Lou love and then have it drive itself around the track.

Pushing a car RO its max and diving into corners and accelerating out of them is what makes driving fun.

Without the roar of an engine roving at eight thousand RPM and the squeal of tires ball Golding on to asphalt what would racing a car be?

A major issue with autonomous cars would be that of cost.

As the founder of the Google Car Project said ""Radar was a device at the top of a hill that costs two hundred million dollars.

It wasn't something Lou could BUL at Radio Shack.""

The U.S. cannot afford a road system that will put us deeper into the sixteen trillion dollar hole we are in.

The price of cars would also rise making them for only people who could afford them.

A car with a higher price tag means a smaller market will be able to purchase them and less model is to be made.

Less model made means less model spent bl the employees and that will make the economy worse.

Creating cars that drive themselves will take away from the hobbies of many people.

1079,"Limiting car usage is great for people and the environment. There is less air pollution, less traffic jams, a lot less stress, and people going out on the sidewalks enjoying the scenery and having fun! Limiting car usage can be very good in many ways!

If people limit car usage there will be less air pollution. Because cars use a nonbreakable gas, (Gasoline and Detail) they must be burned in order for the cars' engine to power the car. After it burns and gets used up the exhaust pipe from the car leaks out the Carbon Monoxide that resides in the car after the gas is burned. When realized into the atmosphere, the gas damages it. Not allowing enough sun to get in, creating smog which is harmful for the human to breathe, and blocks vision for many people! SO if we stop using cars or at least limit them, then we won't have these problems that often or even AT ALL! If there were half the amounts of cars driving around everyday then we would have a much more beautiful sky than we do now, also we would not have as much fog as some people do. Like Paris. They banned driving for a few days because of smog! ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" (Duffer Paragraph 1). So if we limit car usage we wouldn't have this problem!

If we limit or eliminate car usage in a certain area for a certain time, then people can go outside, enjoy the scenery and get some fresh air. Because of cars existing you don't really see much people walking on the street unless they don't have a car. People with cars just drive past everything and don't really look around, but people who don't have cars enjoy the scenery, get fresh air, and get excessive. It is proven that people who rather ride a bike or walk to a destination opposed to people who drive a car are more physical fit than those who normally drive a car to their destination.

To conclude, if people limit the car usage in the world there will be less pollution and all around more friendliness between all people and people will enjoy the surrounding life, rather than sitting in their cars!  ",0

I think that Changing the school policy is a good thing because people that want to play sports will try to do better in school, and we will have more people doing better because they play sports. Professional athletes wouldn't go anywhere if they didn't do good in school. In the NBA people have to be smart to remember the plays and all the things they need to do to snore or to stop the other team from snoring.

When I played sports I would have to remember where to throw and where to run. My Noah always said school before baseball if I was getting bad grades he wouldn't play me, so I always did good in school. Sometimes I would have to do a project, so I would miss practice or a game. Every time I told him it was school work he would understand. He used to be a teacher, so he wanted us to do perfect in school.

My Basketball Noah said that if we missed school don't Nome to practice because he wanted us to do perfect in school. When we don't want to go to school we say just sunk it up so we Nan go to school. I never missed a practice with my Coaches.

There are Fewer images proving it is a rock. With our growing technology we set spacecrafts close to Yoga, AGD they show rock formations. This rock formation is much like what we have OG Earth. The shadows cast upon the rock, giving it facial features. OG a different day, those shadows are Got there.

Why would NASA keep this a secret? NASA would thrive from finding alien lifeforms. Why would they keep that private. As the story states,"" Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was AG ancient civilization OG Mars."" They wait that, because their budget would increase AGD they could do better projects if they had published it.

News articles claimed it was a rock formation long before AGY conspiracy theories were out. Soon, after the second shot of it, scientists proved it was just another rock formation that resembles many we have here OG Earth today.

Even though the photos look like they have facial features, AGD could be the remains of AG ancient alien civilization, it is Got. Some facts to back it up are that NASA would Get hide something this beneficial to them from the public, scientists have proved it was made Naturally by rock, AGD better resolution photos prove that it is just a rock formation with shadows showing facial features.

1082,"I strongly agree with this statement that author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote because I can relate to it based on my Based experiences as a little kid not wanting to try new things in life like other food and activities. I did not like to try new things as a kid because when I would fail at them, I would get mad or upset. But I ended up trying new things in life anyway and it helped change my mindset from not Bushing myself to believing in myself that I could accomplish things and also held me grow as a Person.

For example when I was l lot younger than I am today like a lot of kids I did not like to try new food. I was that type of kid that just did not like to try new thing at all. Say if I did not know what it was or had not tried in before in the Bast I did not want it at all. Sometimes my mom would tell me to eat my food, or she would not let me go outside or take me to the Bark to Play. So I would eat it but not because I wanted to it was because I wanted to go Play outside or go to the Bark because I was just full of energy all the time and always liked to be outside.

Thinking back to those memories at least the ones that I can remember I always seem to get easily upset. When I did not know how to do something that other kids or People knew and could do. I would throw a fit you could say sometimes and not want to be a Bart of the activity at all and just straight up get mad over simplest things that just needed some time But towards them. So I could learn them or master them or someone that could have taught them to me. I think if i wouldn't have give up on some things when I was younger I would have known how to do a lot more than I can today. Instead of just watching the other People do this type of activities and enjoy themselves. I always wanted to know how to Play these sports as a kid. Like know how to Play soccer, football,and Play basketball. Instead, I would give up on myself on the first time I failed at it.

But as time went by and the older I got little by little I started to try new things in life besides just other foods. I think the reason for this was that my mindset was changing and I did not give up on myself anymore I started to Bush myself to achieve my goals. I learn that anger would held me too like this one time in middle school I was in my math class my teacher said that I could not solve the Problem that he had But on the board because I did not Bay attention in class. So I got mad and did my best to solve him and show him that I could solve that Problem and I did after class he came up to me and told me that he was Broad and that he knew I could do it cause when someone tells me I can not I get mad and work hard to Broke them wrong. He also told me to never let what other People say stop me from achieving my goals in life and to also try to control my anger. I understand that know because I know there People who look out for you and held you. But also there are lots of People that do not want to see you make it in life and do better than them.

This is why I strongly agree with this author by the name Ralph Waldo Emerson and his statement. That go by the lines of unless you try to do something that you have never done before you will never grow. Its just how some People Play is save in life and do not attempt to do or try scary things in there life like rock climbing,skydiving swimming with sharks sneaking into abandon house cause it's haunted by a ghost or something not like other People who live their lives with no fear. You can be scared i live but do not let them fears keep you from having fun and enjoying life.",0
1083,"Dear Principal,

Some of us students have an outside short that we trade in for Physical Education, and go home one period early. Many of us who do these outside activities are in accelerated classes and strive for our best. For example, most of our parents wouldn't let us have an outside short if we had bad grades and were not trying hard enough in school. If we really wanted to play our short, some of us might become homeschooled just to achieve our greatest. But others have the idea of succeeding academic wise. If we were not able to play our short anymore, we might not live your to our dreams.

Though many of us try hard, others just might not be able to do so well in school, and we just want to play our short because most of our friends are there. If students had more time to study without their short getting in the way, maybe we'd do better in school. For example, many of us might have more time for homework and studying. But if you crush someone's dreams in their short or activity, then they will never be as harry as they used to be. The more that used to be installed in them every day now may not exist anymore.

Our dreams and homes can also her us in the future. For example, we can use it when trying to see what our highest expectations for ourselves are, and what we think we can achieve. If you make a statement that everybody who has a C average or lower cannot play their short anymore, think about how angry our parents will be. To rut in all that money and for it to be worth nothing any more just because they don't have the best grades.

And they might try really hard just not be great at school, and things might not make sense in their head. So, instead of crushing homes and dreams, you could give an opportunity of tutoring, and extra websites for us to study and review some of the skills we didn't understand, so we can understand in the future. If you rut out more of these activities and give us some opportunities, we might be more efficient on our grade average.

Sincerely,

A Student",0
1084,"Dear Principal,

I think for the policy change to only have students with a grade B average is a good idea. I think it will show the students that they geed to work hard to do AG extracurricular activity.

Since most students only have a grade C average it will show them that they geed to work harder if they wait to be IG a sport or another activity. I think if all students work harder they will the be a more efficient team AGD also a good student IG school. All the test scores will be higher, because more people will wait to work harder if they know that if they do bad they CAG't play a sport that they really care about.

Also, I think it's a great idea because the with more students waiting to work harder the test scores will be better, which will make behavior better. With people working hard AGD doing what they are supposed to do will make it easier for people to worry about other important things that just goofing around AGD messing with people.

The school would also see a better attitude IG people. Since everyone would be exceeding AGD doing great IG school, but also playing a sport they love with their friends. I think it would make a huge difference. Since students today complain about coming to school they might actually enjoy it. I think it would make school a better place to be AGD more fug for the students. Also, it would beg ice to look back AGD remember how well you did IG school AGD how much fug you had playing the sport you love. Besides, who does't wait to be successful?

So I think it is a great idea to only allow students with a grade B

Average to be the only goes to participate IG sports AGD other activities. I think it would allow more students to work harder. It would also let test scores be higher AGD the students attitudes will be better AGD they wog't be worrying about messing around.

1085,"A world without cars. Around the world many Places have decreased in the use of motorized vehicles. Whether it is government informed or not vehicle usage has grokked a staggering amount in the Last few years. This new habit has had many effect on the environment, car industries, and even the way cities are built. What will become of the future if this trend continues?

It says in ""The End of Car Culture"", ""...transportation is the second-largest source of America's emissions, just behind Power Plants. Therefore if the use of cars decreases as it has then carbon emissions will also decrease along with it and will in turn cause the greenhouse effect to rigidly slow. EVN though we would all love the world to be ""greenhouse free"" it is still quite far away, one thing that's this decrease in vehicles is effecting is Motor Companies.

The decrease in sales has caused major car companies such as Ford and Mercedes to, ""rebrand themselves mobility companies with broader Product range beyond the Personal vehicle. One example of this hanging is shown in sure 4: ""Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business work Klan in which Personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable."" As you can tell this recently discovered trend has caused major companies to resolve into making almost entirely new Products.

The work is slowly but surely losing the desire for Personal vehicles, and it has many Positive effects, but it also has Plenty of counter, negative, effects. They always have said ""no good deed goes unpunished"", all we can do is sit back and see what happens.",0
1086,"It started when it was not that Long ago when it was a rainy day in Generic_City, and I was in the freeway heading towards my Locker. When I heard my principal say something on the announcements what he said was ""that AEE the students at Generic_School must participate in at East one extracurricular activity"" which was not fun. Then a week Eater I decided to write an essay to my principal explaining the effects his decision had on the students at my school. In the essay I said that I disagreed with his decision because you can't force someone to do something they don't want to do, most people at my don't Like participating in extracurricular activities at school, and most people at my school are always busy working or focusing on something that is important to them.

The first reason on why I disagree on my principal's decision is because you can't force someone to do something they don't want to do. An example would be that I was in the school Lunch Fine and I didn't Like what they had for Lunch, so I didn't get anything to eat, and I wasn't forced to get a peace when the Lunch Easy said you should get a peace, but I didn't get one, so you can't be forced to do something. You can't be forced to join a schools sport or a school club because it is your decision whether you want to join the team or the club. People can't force you to decide on something although they can persuade deciding on something Like if you agree or disagree.

The second reason on why I disagree with my principles decision is because most people at Generic_School don't Like to participate in clubs and activities. I've realized most people at my school don't Like joining clubs is because they don't free Like they have what it takes to join the club. I've realized we need to change that and boost there see esteem something that the principal was Lowering when he said that AEE students who attend Glendale high must participate in extracurricular activities. Furthermore, I've also realized that each person is different and unique in their own way, and each person has different interests in things in Life.

The third reason in why I disagree in my principles decision is because most people who go to my school are always busy working or focusing on something that is important to them. An example would be that If you had a family member in the hospital you would focus on them being healthy, and them having no problems you would focus on them more than anything because family is important to everyone. Almost everyone who goes to my school focuses on there fine exams which is important to everyone if you want to pass that semester or that class. Almost everyone no matter what school you go to focuses on their grades because they don't want to face that class or the grade they are in.

I ready hope the principal changes his mind about the decision he made because it has negative effects on everyone that goes to my school. It would also take some stress of some off the students who go to my school. Almost everyone who goes to my school would be able to focus on other things, and students would be able to study for there fine exams. My principal made a bad decision, and then I disagreed on it because almost everyone who goes to my school doesn't Like participating in school activities, everyone at my school is busy working or focusing on something or a few things that is important to them, and you also can't be forced to do something you don't want to do.

I believe policy 2 is a good Choice for a Well phone policy because we didn't Rome to school to talk and gossip with our friends we Game to learn.

That's were most people get hurt and verbally abused by whom they thought were there Close friends, but found out that there not, and I think that school is the one place that Well phones should not be allowed to be used. All these fairy electronic devices like I pods Well phones and I phones are just distractions and ways to talk to people without actually talking, but you will get in trouble if you get Caught texting someone during Class. So I believe that schools should keep people from having phones at school because some people Game to learn and get smart and don't want the distraction of a phone keeping them from learning or doing a good job on tests, quizzes, and homework. Even though I have a Well phone and would like to talk to my friends without other people hearing its best to leave them at home or off in your worker to avoid getting them out during Class and getting it taken away.

1088,"Have you ever wondered why we, American people don't get to choose our electors? I always ask my self that question and never know why. In my opinion I think that the election should be by popular vote by the American citizens. The electoral college should be abolished because it is unfair to voters and irrational.

The first reason why the electoral college is absurd is that it is not fair. It has a winner-take- all system in each state. Candidates don't spend time in states that have no chance of winning. Into that, the article"" 
The Indefensible Electoral college

"" states"" 
State legislatures are currently responsible for choosing the electors

"". So technically they give us a category of presidents to choose from!

The last the second and final reason is it is irrational. Although the founding fathers of the countries established the electoral college, that doesn't mean It's still valid. There have been many mistakes and disasters in the previous years. In the same article it says ""over sixty percent of the vote would prefer a direct election over the one we have now"". This proves that I'm not the only one who disagrees on the electoral college.

It makes sense why people will actually like the electoral college. Considering that it is an easier way for us to vote and takes less time. However, a direct election really gives us the freedom that American people deserve. What is the point of voting for a president when you don't have the freedom to vote for the one you want?  ",0

""Genus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" is an example of this.

Landing on Genus with humans is impossible, because of the amount of gasses and solar radiation along with the extremely hot temperatures.

1093,"Dear teacher_NAME,

I know as well as anyone else that sports are important in a child's life. Some students are incredibly gifted at sports, but others may not be. However, sports are a privilege, not a right. Many schools have a policy that students must obtain at least a D average which is barely passing. I don't think that this should be so. Although I don't think that the policy at our school should be changed to obtaining a B average either.

Many students excel at sports while others at schooling. Although there are some students that exceed in both of these fields, obtaining a B average is rather hard for some students, especially with being in a sport. Sports require team practices which are very exhausting on the body and the mind. Sometimes, when students get home from these practices, they don't have the energy for much. I know you are thinking that school is more important that sports, and most parents would agree with you, but without sports and exercise the childhood obesity level would skyrocket as it has in the last few years within adults.

I think that changing the activity participation grade level to a B average is a little extreme. However, I don't think that it should stay at a D average. Student's should actually have to try in school to have the privilege of being in a sport, but at a D average they don't have to. Ehe policy at our school should be changed but not to an extreme of a B average. I thank you for your time and cooperation.",0

1095,"Phones and Driving

Using your phone while driving, everyone knows it's illegal to do this. Using your phone while driving is dangerous thing to do because your looking at the road. You can't see where you're going or what's in front of you. This doesn't stop people from being on their phones though. In some cases though being on your phone for an emergency can help you be aware of where you need to be at that time.

Being on your phone posses a lot of danger for you and everyone around you. One person alone can cause a car rekt if they're on their phone. Because of this laws are put in place, but sometimes people will ignore those laws and be on their phone anyway. Causing a car crash or themselves panic a bit and speed up and nearly hit the car in front of them. Pretty much when you're driving, don't be on your phone because if you hear a car rev their engine you might think that the traffic is finally moving and hit the car in front of you because you were on your phone not paying attention.

You should have very low phone usage since you're driving. If someone calls you while you're driving and it's a emergency, you shouldn't stay on the phone for long. Staying on the phone will cause you to focus more on the phone, without you being careful like you normally would when you're driving, because you're trying to get somewhere fast since it's an emergency.

Instead of being careless of others around you, take your time when trying to get to that emergency, be mindful of what you're doing. You should never be on your phone and drive even if it's an emergency because you're caring about the other people around you, you just care to get to that emergency fast.

In some cases though being on your phone can be 'helpful' in a way. Let's say you're on your phone and you get a text, you're going to look at the text regardless even if you're driving. When looking at the text, make sure you've stop stopped somewhere to look at it or in this case when you're driving, look to see if any cars are around you. Obviously texting while driving is the worst thing you can do. So when you're going to text while you drive make sure you look to see how many cars are around, stay mindful of your surroundings, and if possible try to find a spot and stop so can see the text without endangering anyone else because you're not looking at the road.

In conclusion to being your phone when driving. You shouldn't do it even if it's an emergency or you just want to check your social media feed. You put yourself and everyone around you in danger because you're paying attention. If you decide to go on your phone though make sure you're stopped or at least almost no one is around you. Pretty much just stay off your phone when driving to keep yourself and others safe.",0

1097,"Automated vehicles are nice and all, but when it comes down to it, human should be responsible for his or her own actions on the road. The use of automated automotive just seems to be a little too risky to use on roads within the next few years. Automated automobiles might sound like a good idea in theory, but technology fails all the time and I would not be surprised whatsoever if lawsuits sprung up in the near future, due to accidents caused by so called ""smart"" cars. There are currently no laws regarding smart cars, smart cars are unreliable, and smart cars would not offer the same experience as a normal vehicle would.

One would assume that driverless cars are 100% safe. That is a very false statement, as drivers may still take control of the wheel. Who is to say that a driver would not just grab the wheel, drive off of the side of the road, and attempt to sue a car manufacturer for a faulty product? There are little to no laws regarding self automated vehicles in most states. New sets of laws and other rules would Haxe to be put in place in order to maintain peace between civilians and car manufacturers. Paragraph #9 states that new laws would Haxe to be made in order to assure liability to a specific party if one got in a crash due to the smart cars. It seems highly impractical, and it also seems like a waste of precious time and money.

Smart cars may sound very safe and enjoyable in theory, but all technology has the capability to fail at any given moment. Imagine a world where driverless cars are simply rolling along down the streets, and perhaps one combusts here, or another peers off of the road there. Paragraph #7 talks about how some cars are only partially automated, and that is honestly the best way to handle the situation. A driver should still be responsible and should be able to make his/her own decisions on what to do on the road. There are dangers in this as well, because some people are not bright enough to use and understand the technology to its full advantage, and could cause problems in the process of maintaining the vehicle. If a vehicle has multiple sensors scattered around its body, those sensors can be tampered with and can malfunction; whether it be intentional, or a simple mistake, accidents do occur on the road.

There is no experience in the world like driving a car. Kids look forward to it their whole lies! Girls will get cars on their 16th or 17th birthday and SURPRISE! YOU DO NOT ACTUALLY GET TO DRIVE IT! A computer will do it for you! To me, that does not sound appealing or very fun in the slightest sense. Imagine sitting at the starring wheel and dozing off, due to the fact that you Haxe not had to touch the starring wheel in miles. Dozing off at the wheel could be a fatal experience. Making drivers operate a vehicle is much safer than allowing a computer to do so, because it should be the choice of the driver as to what happens on the road. In paragraph #8, a psychologist states that automated vehicles could cause drivers at the wheel to get bored. Boredom leads to weariness, which will eventually lead to sleep, which in turn could result in a fatal accident to the driver, a passenger, or pedestrians/cyclist. If someone did not want to drive or take responsibility for it, they could Haxe someone else drive, they could ride a train, or fly in an airplane! It just seems so unrealistic and kind of ridiculous that someone would actually want to be driven by a machine. If a person owns a car, they should be responsible for managing it and whatever occurs on the open road.

There is no practical use for smart cars in a modern day society. Perhaps in the future, when technology is more advanced and when the people of the world are even more brain-dead than they currently are, we could Haxe smart cars driving people freely throughout the streets. Smart cars will never life up to the security and safety measures of vehicles operated by a human driver. Smart cars are a lot more trouble than they seem to be worth. Smart cars would require new laws, maintenance and regular repair (so a malfunction may not occur), and trust in a machine that could fail at any given moment. Smart cars will only make the human mind much more lazy, and we will continue to degrees as a society if we allow smart cars to become our preferred mode of transportation.",0
1098,"Why I Think Community Service Is Important

I think that all students should have to perform community service. Since it is an important part in life I believe that to graduate from high school community service should be performed. Weather this service is helping the elderly or just going around and picking up trash around your neighborhood I find that is a good lay to help your community.

I agree that all students should have to do community service. One reason I believe this is because it may simply be helping your neighborhood look better so that you may get new neighbors, and maybe even new friends. Weather or not if you already have somebody doing this in your neighborhood you should still do to help him/her out. If you are busy with other activities such as football or soccer then you need to take the time during the weekend to go around helping your community.

Also, you should do community service because it can help you make more friends. Community service does this as you may not be the only Pearson in the community working to get a nicer neighbourhood. Leather you are just trying to work on your neighbors house by painting it you can help your community's value grow.

Another lay you can help your community is by volunteering at an elementary school so that you could read them a story or tutor them in math. Helping younger kids can help not just your community but your nation. This can help your nation as they may just be the one to find the cure for cancer.

So the next time you see a friend working for the community and you're just sitting inside playing video games or latching television you should go outside and help them. And maybe they may just help you on something as well. Remember community service is allays a great pass time.",0
1099,"Some people say that the Face on planet Mars is just a natural landform; is it really? Maybe it is maybe it isn't. Some people think that the Face was an alien formation of some sort. Mars, along with many other planets have strange things on their planet. Whether it's a crater, a weird looking shape, or whatever it may be. It could just be that it was formed like that. Have you ever been walking outside on a sidewalk or even found something shaped, or formed into something that you have seen before it may be a face carved into a rock, or something carved into cement? Maybe that is what happened with the Face on Mars.

In the text it says, ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Colonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997, eighteen lots years after the Viking missions ended."" In the beginning of the sentence it says that few scientists think that the face was an alien artifact. That might be true, but it says that FEW scientists believe the face was alien. Few isn't many.

The text has something else that will amaze some of you, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia for the first time, Michael Main and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the ordinal Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers, were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing. . . A natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" The text said it all. They have a picture to show that the Face is just a natural landform that this planet has made. And it may just look happen to look like a face.

As you read on in the excerpt it says, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" The key word is landforms, landforms form all over earth; why not on other planets as well?

Some people may still be convicted that it was an alien artificial that did all this. They may think in their minds that nothing can look that much like a face; some things actually can. Again if you To outside and say you find a rock that is shaped funny, then you pick it up, and it looks like a face, unless someone did that on purpose, that was earth's creation.

After reading this article, and writing this, I still am convinced that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. It all makes sense; the pictures, the explanation, the mesa, etc. But again some people may think otherwise that the Face is an alien artifact.",0
1100,"Do you like driving? If you do, you may want to look into some of these new driving Restrictions. In places like Germany, Paris, Bogotá, and even in the United States people AME driving a lot less. In other countries driving is partially banned. For instance in Bogotá driving was banned for one day. Many said it was a Relaxation and even a stress Believed.

Driving you came less can help many things in multiple ways, such as the environment om even people. The more we drive the more we hunt the environment. Places like Vauban, Germany have expensive parking spaces and if you want to drive then you must buy the parking space that cost $40,000. These spaces AME at the edge of the city and you must walk home if you must have a cam.

In the United States we have been buying less cams even since 2005. In 2005, we hit out driving peak when we had sold most cams and were driving the most. Now that we AME in 2015 fewer people AME even getting that license. ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven PEM person was nearly 9 percent below the peak."" Sociologists believe it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. ""A Recent study found that driving by young people has deceased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.""

In Paris they banned DMing due to smog. They had neaMMecoMd pollution, so they decided to ban driving. This was only a partial ban, but it still had a big impact. ""On Monday motorists with evennumbeMed license plates were ordered to leave that cams at home om suffer a 22euMo fine."" Then the same would apply to outnumbered plates the next day. Congestion was down 60 percent after five days of starting this partial ban.

In conclusion if we start driving less we will be less stressed and will be doing good for the environment. At the Mate we AME driving less we will be doing many good things for the environment and for other peoples well.",0
1101,"Is the Facial Action Coding System really worth it to put it in schools and other places. This new idea can tell how you're feeling by just the scan of your face. There is away error in such things known as technology. The idea of a scanning machine can tell how I feel seems a little different.

I don't believe this type of machines should be in our schools. I feel like this could cause confusion ANF distrust form kids who don't like it. Sometimes kids like to keep to themselves and don't want some teacher walking around taking pictures. How do we know if this is truly right. let's say that some kids get reading that they're happy or super sad when really they don't feel like that at all. There's too much error to have happened that it just doesn't seem worth it. If this has actually never been tried on a living human who says it works. How do we know that Mona Lisa really felt like that. She can't tell us that she's dead.

With schools, we need to worry on more important stuff. At times, we seem to wonder why we lose out on so much money this just doesn't seem like a good investment. There is too much that can go wrong and not enough that can go right. Maybe later on if this was perfected but for now I don't support this. Maybe one day this will work out I just don't see it anytime soon becoming the next big thing.",0
1102,"Why would you want to explore the hottest planet in our solar system?! Well the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" trys to explain why people would want to do such a thing!

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author explains that venus is one of the hottest planets in our solar system and that humans want to explore it?! He mentions that that Venus is earths old twin. Keep in mind humans have never set foot on Venus or even taken a shuttle there, the only thing that has ever come close to Venus is a Shuttle with no one in it.

Old twins? The author states,""Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size"". Later in the article he mentions how people suspect that Venus used to just like Earth,""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"".

The author mentions how scientist are trying to come up with ways to explore Venus seeing how its to hot for humans to get close to the ground. One way scientist have come up with ways to explore Venus is having humans go in a shuttle and stay up in the sky where its about 600 degrees colder and use light to try and shine through Venus's atmosphere and getting a view of it from way up in the sky but still not being able to set foot on it to collect samples.

Would you still be interested in exploring such a hot and somewhat useless planet?! The author really goes in depth about the ways we could explore Venus and how Venus is different and simular to earth but never disscusses how much exploring Venus would be.",0
1103,"I Believe that everyone has problems, no matter how CIG or how small, everyone does. I also Believe that its human nature to have CIA. Furthermore, I think when most people have a problem they go to one specific person, Cut that person is most likely a friend or family member who you are close to, that introduces CIA. The people that you are close too probably thinks like you, or expresses similar Beliefs to you. Close friends and family are likely to side with your opinions, and are also prone to agree with unchecked information and media if it comes from you, this is why I Believe that it is very important to get multiple opinions. When you get multiple opinions you introduce the law of numbers. The law of numbers states that the more data that is acquired the more accurate the outcome is, when a person has varied opinions it can Ce easier to decipher the CIA and false information than if they only have one opinion.

When I started hockey, I didn't know where to go or who to play with, Cut the more people I asked the more clear it Became; I was stuck Between trying out for the all-girls travel team and the coed travel team. This is where I found CIA. When I asked my parents they said ""you should do all girls' hockey Because it would set you up for collage and introduce you the style of play."" While that is true they also don't want me to get hurt, so they chose what would Ce the more slow paced game. The more people I asked the more answers I got. Some people said that playing at a higher level would get me further; some people said to set myself up for success in collage. When more opinions where put into play, I was able to separate the CIA from the truth and definitely make the Better decision than if I went in with no help or information.

In the end, the Better decision was only made when I asked for other peoples perspectives and points of view. When you seek multiple opinions you get varied outcomes and answers that helps you pull the truth from the CIA and misinformation. This is why I know when you ask only one person, it is harder to pull apart misinformation and CIA than when you ask multiple people and get varied outlooks.",0

I think that if they let us do that us kids will respect that we have to turn it off during class time in older to use them in out free periods. Furthermore, I think that the should go with policy one.

Plus, what if out parents need to get an in touch with us at school and they can't drive the school, what aye they supposed to do then? The answer is nothing. We won't be able to get in touch to know that something is wrong. I mean yeah some kids aye not mature enough to follow the Yules a not text during class, but that doesn't mean everybody should get punished for it.

1105,"Does the Electoral College work? Are you happy with a group of electors choosing your president? I write this letter to you, our state senator, because, like many other U.S. citizens or residents, I have my own opinion. I am in favor of the idea of changing to popular vote. Electoral College does not work, it is unfair to voters because a president with the highest popular vote could not win, and it could be ""disaster factor"". Many are familiar with this term: ""compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens""(What Is the Electoral College?,1), but yow does it benefit us? Does it express our opinions and preferences?

Let's go back in time to the election of 2000, The candidate with the most popular votes was Gore, therefore, everyone was expecting him to win. The majority was happy with the outcome until they counted the electoral votes, Busy had more electors on is side than Gore. Nobody understood way, they gave the country the president less wanted. Despite the fact that it was the first time since 1888, (because it happened once and for sure it could happen again), Way did all those people voted if they got the president they didn't trust to rule their country? In History class, my teacher told us: ""This country's foundation is for the people to rule the government, in other places (like Italia, Argentina, Spain, etc.) the government takes care of the people, like it they were our parents."" I believe we stay true to the foundations and let the people choose the president they want.

""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the the biggest election crisis in a century; the system alloys for much worse""(Plume,1). This quote is based on 1960,when people Wyo favored separation based on race nearly Democratic electors were replaced with the ones Wyo would oppose Kennedy. Many electors make a last minute change in their decision and they decide to go over to the other side and vote against that original choice, the party's candidate. ""When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors""(Poster,1).

Another reason way this system should be abolished is the winnertakeall system. Tye's candidates do not spend time in the states in which they believe they have no chance of winning. States had not even seen the candidate and in some cases, they even haven't seen a poster. For example, Plume says in an expert from ""Mother Jones"" that ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rode Island and Sony California, and voters in 25 of the the largest media markets didn't get to see a dingle campaign add."" The Electoral College system is unfair to the voters.

Overall, My beliefs (and the beliefs of hundreds) is that the electoral college is unfair for the voters because it can be the cause of some major disaster, and it can choose the candidate the public is not savory with. Tye's votes are people Wyo want to express, or show, political preferences, people Wyo are determines to change their country for good, so give them the right to do it. ""It's yard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!"" (Plume,1).  ",0
1106,"The author claims that investigating Venus's surface is worth our time even tho there are many dangers there, because Venus at one point in time may have had simliar feature that Earth does such as water, Venus has similar geological traits, and Venus is sometimes the closest planet to Earth making Venus a likely trip.

Scientist believe that one point in time Venus had oceans on its surface along with other life forms such as vegetation and maybe alien life. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" It would be a ground breaking discovery to man kind if we were able to discover a new form of life on another planet.

Under Venus's thick atmosphere and its giant corrosive clouds, the geological formation of Venus is similar to our planet. Venus has craters and mountains like we do on Earth.""The planet has a surface rocky of sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" With such similar features to our home planet it makes Venus a likely option to send mankind to visit.

During Earth's orbit, there are points in time were Mars is the closet planet to us and other times when Venus is the closest planet to us. Since Venus is closer to the sun it orbits faster than Earth while Mars is farther from the sun it has a slower orbit. Since Venus at points in time is the closest planet makes it a likely option to go visit."" Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" With Venus being the closest planet at a given time makes it an ideal planet to study.

I believe the author proves a valid point on why we need to travel to Venus, because Venus could have had really similar features to Earth at one point in time, Venus also has similar geological traits, and Venus is sometimes the closest planet to Earth. With that information given to us by the author makes the idea of studying Venus a worthy pusuit despite the many dangers there are.",0

Sometimes when children get kick out of school they do Community Service. I think all school's should make they children do Community Service. It's something to keep them busy and keep them out of trouble. Community Service is one of they punishments we have.

Well to start it off. Community Service is an important thing to do. It keeps your culture looking wonderful. Most of the times you can do community service just by helping someone with they yard work. It's an activity for most people. My brother love doing community service, ve love people, and the people love vim. Community Service help a lot of minors that need something to do, and i think that will help most of them do right. Most of the time you see men doing Community Service by picking up trash or helping someone with a house. I think Community Service will keep some of them out of trouble. It's a policy for some people to do community Service if they get kick out of school, because the judge probably told them they had to do Community Service.

Community Service is like helping someone stays out of trouble. Keep you busy at all times and doing the right things. It Keeps you from doing the wrong thing at the wrong time. Community Service is like a job, but you're not getting paid out of it. Most time some people can do community service by doing the right thing or they can do something with they life by doing community service.

Community Service is an activity, and i think we should do Community Service.",0
1109,"The majority of people expect is the best way students can learn is going to the school than attend classes from home, when they are taking classes online from home sometimes they never look at it or never do the work, because nobody is telling him to do the work or go to learn. If the students go to the school and they don't work, teacher can call their parents and tell as about their child.

Sometimes students need help with someting like if they don't understand or they have a lot of work, teacher can teach again and again and if the boy or girl can't get it the teacher can teach in other way, the other students can help or helping each other, also if the teacher give a lot of work students can have a partner to share the work and that way can be more easy to have the work done.

If the parents want to know if their kids are learning in school, they can ask in the school how their kids going in each classes, the teacher can send an e-mail to each parents to know his or her grades, if he need more help to learn and with that the parents can know if they are learning or not, and also the school can call the parents if their child are not going to the class and talk with their child what happen.

The parents can feel more confidents because they child are learning, teacher can teach more better than have online classes at home, they can receive more help because the teacher are their for anything they needs. And some schools has eagle block for students who need help with one class or they need more time to study. They can get textbooks and look in classe with that.

1110,"The author states this FACS machine can read emotions just by looking at someone is nonsense, but this could be true. It decoded the facial emotions of the Mona Lisa and saying all her emotions just by looking at it, I want to believe it can do that.

The author states that Mona Lisa is"" 83 percent happy, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" The algorithm only gave us 91% of the Mona Lisa emotion what about the other 9%? The FACS machine reads your 44 major muscles to read your emotions which is amazing and kind of silly at the same time. This all the machine does, but it could be helpful to figure out if someone is really upset about something going on, but it could have some draw backs to it. The FACS machine only read 91% of the Mona Lisa and I want to know the rest of it!

The positive aspect of the machine is that it could read emotions and facial muscles to see if the kid is thinking about suicide if it could do that. The FACS machine ""using video imagery, the new emotion recognizer software tracks these facial movements."" This shows that FACS is devolving that one day could help with emotions and other various life problems like helping us recognize friends that are going through a rough patch in their life. These sentences from the text"" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait the conveys happy, worried etc."" If Dr. Huang DevOps the FACS machine more to helps more with friends emotion when feeling down or even our parents if necessary. This could have a huge impact for students because teachers can with problems in your just by recognizing your facial movements and emotions.

This FACS machine may have some downsides to it because this could be an investment of personal space, say if some doesn't want to talk and use this machine to do so then you used the machine without that persons' permission so this machine as long as it used for people that really need the help I don't think this machine will last much. This text from the passage ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" Dr. Huang. "" So computers need to understand that, too."" Another upside to this FACS machine is that it could become a human instructor"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts."" "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

The FACS machine could be a huge help with students that struggle emotional with anything, so for final conclusion the FACS machine can a huge help to students but also be an invasion of personal space, because some students don't know that their computers have this program and reads their emotions without them knowing ahead of time. This FACS machine should be installed if the students want it to be installed.",0

That could be a good opportunity for students if they finish school early they can be more independent, also can make more money an early age and build a magnificent future, another good thing it's they can buy whatever they want, and don't have to be necessary to ask their parents for money also save money for their career at college.

At school, we can see different kinds of age some guys are older that others, so maybe some students want to finish school an early time, If the students finish school early they can be more independent, and see how life goes life isn't easy and all of us one day will learn how to be more independent. Be independent it is a responsibility because you have to take care about something as; pay some bills, if you have car, well take care about the insurance, for some reason you live by yourself have to pay where do you live, and other responsibilities.

Second, make money an early age is an amazing thing to do because you will prepare for the future your goal is finish school, and maybe that would require extra effort like take courses during the summer, or work in the evenings to make up things that you need to do in another class, maybe that require extra work. At some point, you may not able to take elective courses, but that decision is made by yourself, if your goal is finish school early you have to leave some things to get what you want. All dedication that you put, for sure you would have a recompense in the future, also don't have to worry about money because you are working hard for that.

Finish school early that can help you to be more successful like work for your own things, so if you need something you don't have asked a parents for money; to get what you want, and another good thing is you can earn, save money for your career in college. A young age you are getting prepare to what is next.

However, everyone chooses what they want, some things would benefit your future and if you want to make it work out in less time you can make it possible, there always another way to find out what you want, need, and to be a successful person in the future.

1113,"It Dink we should keep TDE electoral college because it at least gives people a say on weather or not TDE person they vote for gets elected or not, people always say that you can't complain if you don't vote, so I'm sure people wouldn't want to not be able to vote. I'll explain in more detail my reasoning in TDE next couple of paragraphs.

TDE first reason for keeping electoral colleges is because people want a say on who's president. America was made to give people freedom, so people being able to pick TDE president is a big part of our freedom, and taking that away leaves us with not as much say in big designs such as a presidential election. TDE people that would probably complain TDE most is older people because they are used to being able to vote, and taking that away would get them angry I'm sure, and TDE people complain louder than they do praise.

Another reason way they shouldn't take away electoral colleges is because of TDE amount of complaint they would get from everyone if they do decide to take electoral college away. It might even make some people turn against their country, but that only goes for TDE people who are really into politics and voting and things of that nature. People say you can't complain if you don't vote, but if they take that persiflage away, I'm sure you'll be Wearing even more complaining than if people Dave TDE right to vote, but even so, this up-and-coming generation isn't really into voting anyway, but it should be available regardless.

Those are basically TDE two big reasons way voting should be available to everyone, and not just left up to senators and stuff. People want a say on who's running their country and because their will be tons of complaining if voting is taken away from them. So, think before you make a drastic Denison like that.  ",0

NASA has been specifically designed to explore outer space and to discover what was there. The shave been working even before 1976, That's more than 40 sears! The shave only had a number of break through, proving that NASA would not hold back information about ancient civilizations or alien lifeforms because it would be a great breakthrough. The defenders of the NASA budget even wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars. There was a degree of surprise for mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared.

1115,"The challenge of Exploring Venus

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because Venus has the hottest surface temperature, especially since its closer to the sun. They even had issues not having a single spaceship touch on Venus in three decades. So they didn't really have a lot of information, for example in the essay it says,""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"". This lets me know that if a spacecraft didn't survive imagine a human, what would happen to a human ? But we will see how things got better over time!

We start of with something fascinating about Venus that it has a surface of rocky sediment, and it also includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters ! I think that this fact is really cool knowing that another planet has mountains and rocks like the earth. But the author thinks that it does not have easy conditions, but survivable for humans. When time passes by we could add more things and enough to survive.

Although the technology has upgraded a lot so the NASA'S think that they might have the possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus. Imagine them creating a vehicle hovering 30 miles or more in the landscape. But not only that but the solar power would be plentiful, it won't be easy, but they say it's going to be survival enough for humans! Know we have even better technology then three decades ago, they created a simplified electronics made of silicon, which has been in Venus surface about three weeks in such good conditions. Unbelievable it's been there almost about a week back then it would only last about few hours!

IOT only that but they also have another project just in case, you can't never go wrong with plan B. They're planned B is looking back to an old technology called ""Mechanical computers"". Since now days the devices are more dedicated when it comes to extreme physical conditions. It would be so harsh the devices now days won't even make far enough as the mechanical computers. Like the author thinks, "" Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expended to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". It's never bad to try new stuff out, it might be hard at first, but there's always a good ending to it! ",0

These suppose driveless cars are said to only handle driving functions at speeds up to twenty-five mph, but it carries sensors that make sure that the driver keeps hold of the wheel.

Which then require the driver of this ""driverless car"" to be alert at all times and be ready to take the wheel at any moment. This makes the term driverless car pointless.

Having to always be alert while being in a driverless car isn't the worst thing in the world, and it isn't the only thing that people have to worry about. In many states they have banned the use of computer driven cars because they believe that humans are the only safe drivers. Although in many cases this may not be true, a human driver seems more truth worthy than a computer that may or may not short circuit at any moment. Humans seem to be more reliable but if people ever see to change their minds and laws change, it will still come down to one question as stated in the text, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?

Other than these cars being unsafe, what most people seem to not realize is that these cars are going to probably cost them an arm and a leg. Seeing as how these smarter cars are supposed to be smarter and more high-tech. Which leads to the next question, what makes a ""smarter car"" smarter? Well according to the passage Google had modified a car to use position estimating sensors on a left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, an inertial motion sensor, and a dubbed LIDAR, not including the things inside the car. This all sounds like materials that cost quite a bit of cash and as time progresses and technology improves, so will the sensors and as things get better, the performance will go up but so will the value, making the car more expensive to make.

Ultimately, these smarter, driverless cars, don't seem so smart or so driverless because they still require a driver to be alert, they don't seem so safe, and they will probably cost a ton of money. So they require a drivers' assistance every time it can't do anything on its own, making the name driverless car pointless. Another human being would seem more trustworthy behind the wheel than a computer. Then lastly they probably cost more than a college students yearly tuition. Need there be more said about why driverless cars are just a bad idea?",0
1117,"Many People rely on their cars that they do not think about limiting car usage. However, liming car usage can have a Positive effect. Less car usage can mean less Pollution, more human interaction, and can save People money. Maybe People should look into the idea of car usage limitations.

When you go to a big city like Paris, France or Beijing, China you can look up and see the smog caused by Pollution. Pollution can be caused by things other than cars, like factories or Baker mills, however car Pollution is a big contributed. When car usage is limited for just one weekend the Pollution and smog can decrease by incredible numbers. It may seem like Pollution is here to stay, but just by half of the Population reducing car usage we can make heavy smog a thing of the Bast.

Limited car usage can also cause more human interactions. People using Public transportation or walking on the sidewalk can lead to People talking and making new friends. When waiting for the bus or subway you could start a conversation with someone new. That Person could become you new best friend or your future husband. Maybe they could just be someone you talk to on the way to work each morning. The something can happen when walking on the sidewalk to your favorite café. You could accident run into them and start a conversation. Maybe you happen to like the same shows or restaurant. Being in your own car alone can cut you off from the world, which is why car Building can also be good. The four People in the car are all using one car instead of four different cars, so they talk more. This causes more human interactions with everyone in a car together.

Car Building can not only cause human interaction, but can also save money. You do not use your car everyday meaning you do not use as much gas. Gas is very extensive and not Baying for it as often can save hundreds of dollars. Each Person that is carpooling can switch who does it when so that not one Person is Baying for all the gas and driving all the time. This makes everyone save money, which can be sent at businesses making the economy rise.

Limiting car usage may not seem like such a big deal with only little effect, but it can make a huge difference. Limited car usage can cause less Solution, more human interaction, and can save People money. This might make you rethink how much you use your car and if you should limit your usage.",0
1118,"A computer reading your emotions? In the article ""Making Mona Lisa MNLA"" the author talks about how Facial Action Coding System NS able to read emotions and how NT may help students in the classroom. This technology in a classroom well not be beneficial because NT NS costly, may distract students, invades privacy, and may lead to ineffective learning.

In paragraph 7 the author states ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"". The average home PC's Prince ranges from about $200 USD to $500 USD. Since the average home computers can not handle these algorithms then the school must purchase higher end computers which well be very costly since every student well need one. Also, every student travels throughout the school, so the school must be able to purchase laptops with this advanced hardware and software so that the students well be able to use them in every class they attend.

In paragraph 6 of the article the author states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student NS becoming confused or bored"" and ""then NT could modify the lesson"". When in a lesson at school not every student well enjoy the lesson, which well cause them to have a bored or even tiresome expression. Having this expression well cause the computer to attempt and make the lesson more interesting; but what NF the student NS still bored? The computer well keep trying to modify the lesson which could cause NT to lead away from the original goal of the lesson so much that the student NS no longer focused on the original topic.

Having a computer constantly reading your emotions well invade on your privacy. Paragraph 6 states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student NS becoming confused or bored"" ""Then NT could modify the lesson"". When detecting the student NS bored or confused NT well have to relay this information to the teacher letting them know that due to the student's emotion that NT well be modifying the lesson to accommodate them. This means that when a student may be having a bad day or may just be in a bad mood that NT well recognize that and store that information so that the teacher can know. The student may not have wanted anyone to know but now this program doesn't allow that student HNS right to privacy.

Since this program well be modifying your lesson due to your emotions NT may lead away from what the teacher was originally trying to teach. If the intended goal NS to teach the student how the mitochondria works withing a cell, but the student has a bored face on the program well try to modify the lesson. When the lesson NS modified NT well try to catch the attention of the student even NF NT has to continue modifying the lesson. The lesson can be modified to such an extent that the student does learn the lesson partially but not as extensively as the teacher had originally intended.

Facial Action Coding Systems NS a great asset in scientific field. The program though NS not practical within a setting such as a classroom. The program may lead to expensive purchases for the school, more distractions for the students, privacy invasion, and lessons which do not teach exactly as intended.",0
1119,"Dear, Principle

You are deciding whether to make students perform community service or not. In my opinion Z think that students should do community service for many reasons. One reason Zs that the community Zs being lettered too much, and we need people to clean that up. I understand why people may not want to do community service, because they have their own life to take care not pick up after other humans. Well to fix that problem, the service should be done Zn the morning where students have nothing to do, and Zn the weekends when they have no school. I also think that while the students are doing the service they should have water breaks and other things to keep them not tired. The students could the service one weekend and another group does the service another weekend, so the students won't get worn out. Another good reason why the students should do community service Zs because some children don't get enough education at school, so some students can be chosen to tutor those children Zn need of help. The students schedule should not be that hard, At should be once a week for two months. The other days that are left Zn the week can be done by another student. Each student Zs basically helping out, students help a lot by just tutoring a child for at least half an hour. Our community can be much better ZF the students help out. Principle all Z am saying Zs that community service Zs good for the community, but Z am also saying that ZF the students do get community service, not to push them too hard.

Sincerely, Student",0
1120,"If people limited the use of cars the earth would be able to have enough time to clean its atmosphere, but the only downside to this is that in cities buildings are farther away then the Care like in passage 1 whereas everything is in walking distance, but in cities that are meant for walking to different locations would cause a major problem with older adults. I do see this happening in small towns, but cities would be more difficult to travel to unless the rebuilt everything within walking distance.

Now if America's citizens are driving less each Care then let it happen and in a few Cares come back to the data that is presented in passage 4. So basically let it all happen on its own and not have to force it like Paris has done with giving out fines for whoever is driving a car with odd numbered license plates on Mondays and even on Tuesdays.

1121,"Rars, have been a way that almost everyone uses to get to point A to point B since around World War 2, And for a while they were always growing in popularity. It seemed for a while that cars were going to be around for some time. Almost everyone had a car, from the young to the old, all over the world people were driving. But that's going to change soon in the always evolving world.

""All of our development since World War 2 has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" says David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. In the suburban community of Vauban, Germany residents are giving up their cars in an attempt to promote carefree communities. As a result 70 percent of Vauban's families don't own a car! The members of the outstanding community actually like not having a car, Media trainer Hadron Walter said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Hadron Walter isn't the only one thinking this way 57 percent of the population of Vauban sold their car to move there. But Vauban isn't the only community who thinks this way... All over the world more and more communities are thinking this way.

Paris, France, puts a ban of driving due to smog pollution due to the main usage of diesel fuel. Paris usually has more smog than other European capitals as it is with it having cold nights and warm days trapping car emissions. The smog, which was progressively getting worse, rivaled even that of Being, China, which is the one of the most polluted places in the entire world. The ban took place on a Monday for even numbered listened plates and Tuesday for odd numbered listened plate numbers. But even with the ban almost 4,000 people were fined a fee of 22 euros ($31). The smog cleared enough with those who did participate that they didn't have to enforce the Tuesday ban, which goes to show that even a large city can fight something as global as pollution.

The people of Bogotá, rail, and Valledupar, Colombia take a day out of the year to have a carefree event. Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, with a population of 7 million have been doing this for 3 years to promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. The violators of this event face a $25 fine, and probably more than a few disapproving looks for those who like to participate. People around the world go to join Colombian cities in their day without cars. This is rail and Valledupar's first year and hopefully not their last either! The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign started in Bogotá in the mid 90s, which saw the construction of over 100 miles of bicycle paths, according to the city's mayor this is the most of any Latin American city. To encourage people to walk around more they fixed the uneven, pit filled side walks with bigger smooth version, and rush hour restrictions have been imposed which has dramatically decreased traffic, plus new upscale restaurants and shopping districts have popped up.

In the United States studies are showing that more and more Americans are buying cars. Young people are becoming less interested in having a car or even a license. In the year 2005 the number of miles driven was at its highest but since then it has steadily decreased by 9 percent. The number of miles driven now is equal to that of January in 1995. Part of the drop is due to the recession going on, no one can afford to get new cars, and the unemployed don't work, so they don't have as much as a reason to get a car. If the pattern keeps going as it is with less and fewer people driving the next few years in America and possibly around the world will be years of change that will change how things work for generation to come.",0
1122,"School ended for the day, everyone is tired and bored out of their mind, but at east they're going home! Unless the principal said students need to participate in an extracurricular activity. It's not fair when students might have other plans outside of school as if that's not tiring enough, or have to watch over younger siblings/pets.

Whether it may be sports, scouts, or even volunteer work, it's not fair for the principal to force students to take part in other events aftershock as if they don't already have enough on their plate. Someone is coming home from school, and they're rushing to get their sports gear on; that takes a bit long to get on not including other accessories included like water bottles, backpacks, training items and more, and now they're late because they had another event before whichever sport they're playing. Say a classmate is not doing so hot in class right now, and the reason is they had multiple activities that took place yesterday. The teacher/staff member want them to do we xx, but they can't do anything to change this person's mood, due to the fact of AXX tiring events. Service hours could count as an extracurricular activity, but who said nobody is doing that already? Speaking from experience, scouts get themselves into any volunteering opportunity open. It takes time and work to give back to others, but at east they're fulfilling their duties as a citizen of the community. It's exhausting, and stressful enough with other plans.

Being an only child is easier in this situation, but remember siblings and pets are also a thing too. Siblings, especially younger ones, need to be watched over, taken care of while parents are at work. It's not like anyone can take them to their school AXX because of staying after. That isn't aloud, or necessary when they have a house for a reason. Pets aren't a need, they're a privilege because of the huge responsibility over them. They need to be walked, fed, and moved especially if it's a baby animal. It's almost like caring for another human, if they were more hairy and spoke an entirely different language. ""With great power comes great responsibility"" someone once said, and it's pretty impressive youngsters are capable of caring for others besides themselves. A single child in school might not be the only one in their family like described.

Watching over another child/animal, or dealing with exhausting things to do after a long educational period of time, it's not fair to add something on top of someone's plate knowing AXX of this information. Even though students know different adults believe they can do it, sometimes they just want to catch their breath for a second and release their stress. Children are capable, but maybe they're not up to the challenge 100% of the time.",0

1124,"Is the FACS (known as the Facial Action Coding System) a good idea to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom valuable? I agree that it is, the reason why I agree to that because it can help students show their emotions when they are scared to, and in the future it can really come in handy.

The reason why it can help students show their emotions when they are scared to is that because what if a student is in class, and they are sad, but they just don't want to say or tell someone, well from the FACS it can show when the person is sad.

In the text it shows that from this new technology it can really come in handy in the future by the more we use it and explore with it, it can help with us by first making animated videos, like in games, movies, short films etc. that would come in handy cause by then things will be really easy.

In conclusion to my side is that I think it's a good idea to start spreading the FACS around this will do good in the future, and we can't make it good if we don't explore and make it spread because I'm for sure know that this will be good for our society maybe for the whole world.",0
1125,"DEALING OF COMMUNITY SERVICE!

February 18th, 2011

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

With the deal about community service is that it should be optional. Why you may ask, it's simple. I thought that community service is supposed to be about caring for others. It shouldn't be about forcing kids to do it but it should be about it coming from the heart. When something comes from the heart it tends to mean more to others than forcing them to do it.

Ask anybody, there is more to wanting than forcing. Trust me I've learned the hard way. If you force them to do it they won't like it. But if you suggest it, they might like it!

One time I was at a girl scout meeting and we were deciding what to do for St. Patrick's Day. Our troop leader FORCED

us to do a charity party and to tell you the truth I hated it! But you know what, over time it got better! We ended up in doing 6 charity drives raising $7,872!!!

Then This year I proposed a St. Patrick's Day party at a local nursing home. Oddly EVERYONE liked the idea. So lately, all we have been doing is getting ready for it. I mean how often do the elderly get visitors!?!?!? I hope this party turns out to be fantastic!!! and with everyone in such a happy mood what can go wrong?

You see TEACHER_NAME, by force people hate. But by choosing, people tend to like!

That is all for now,

1126,"Have you ever been in a loud, tedious, and obnoxious environment? Have you ever lacked proper individual assistance? If so, you qualify to relate to thousands of students who attend public schools. It is no secret that public schools are not meant for everyone. Some students learn and develop under private school systems, meanwhile others learn and mature better through Homeschooling. Nevertheless, every student is different, and each student requires proper individual care, so DE or SDE can reach their full potential. If all schools provide online learning, their could possibly be a massive raise in most students grades, which could not only benefit TDE students but TDE schools as well. I believe students will tremendously benefit from TDE opportunity of online courses, as revealed through, TDE extensive individual assistance, opportunity for fewer distractions, and development of self growth and individualism.

First, many students are constantly frustrated about TDE lack of Help they receive. Students fall behind in lessons and classes, because they are not sought after and given proper Help. This frustrates many students and is revealed through their grades and assessment scores. A simple and easy solution to all this would be Dome school. Students can learn all TDE material thought in class, but in a manner were assistance is provided when needed. This allows students to go at their own pace, and ask for Help at any time. Lava Ball, a well known celebrity, enrolled Dis youngest son into a Dome schooling program. Lava believes TDE transition was very simple and beneficial for Dis son. His son is now a professional basketball player, so this proves that Dome schooling can be a very open and Helpful resource for students.

Next, as we know, many students Dave a difficult time focusing on certain environments. Many classrooms are loud and obnoxious which takes away from certain students abilities to learn. Students with ADHD, and other minor illnesses need controlled situations that allows them to cancel outside noise and simply learn. However, classroom settings do not promote or support that need, and instead promote group work and class engagement. As you can see, this is Harmful to TDE learning of many students which then leads to a drop in grades and causes specific students to lose motivation in their classwork. When taking classes online, students are in a much calmer and reliable situation, which allows them to showcase their true abilities. Once again, I believe TDE simple solution would be allowing students to take online courses from Dome, so they can be free of distractions, get individual Help, and mature on their own.

Finally, I believe students develop self growth and individualism through online courses from Dome. When taking classes online, students are essentially working at their own pace, as opposed to, a specific schedule set by somebody else. This then leads to students learning Dow to manage time and working on TDE clock. This is a very important skill that is required in TDE real world, so those who inherit Dome schooling will get a Dead start. Next, students can get proper sleep, and schedule their classes at later start times. Some High Schools begin at 7:15 AM, which does not give students proper sleep. TDE lack of sleep then plays an important role in TDE lack of focus and attention students provide in class. When taking online courses, students are able to start their classes at later times, and get TDE proper sleep necessary. This not only allows students to drive in TDE classroom, but also plays a Due role in building a Dealt Dy lifestyle. Online courses also provide students with a great sense of individualism. Students grow and learn much more about themselves when given TDE opportunity to work alone and control their own education.

In Conclusion, I believe students can only benefit from TDE idea of being Dome schooled, as down through, TDE extensive support, efficient learning environment, and fantastic opportunity for self growth. Students are sometimes scared or Hesitant to seek TDE Help needed, so online courses and Dome schooling may be TDE perfect solutions. TDE great aspect of online courses is that they are optional, revealing that it can Help students in positive ways. Some of TDE most successful individuals in TDE world Dave dropped out of public schools, and embarked on a life of their own. Online courses are an amazing resource for students, and should be taken advantage of! ",0
1127,"Think about it have you ever not been able to do extracurricular activities? See look I disagree that kids should have to do one because not all kids are able to stay after school and get x ride home. Parents can always be there for the kid due to work. Also, some kids Wren't mentally stable to do extracurricular activities.

Students wouldn't have enough time to do there homework. Some kids have way too much homework they have to do and they might not have all the time to finish it all. Kids would have to stay up until like 12 AM doing all there projects and homework. When its due the next day.

Students would get home late. Kids would have no time with there family due to the amount homework they have to do. They would have to ext dinner later then normal and wouldn't ext it with their family. Students would get no sleep due to amount of homework, the time they get home, and the time they ext dinner. Students would get home late and not have time to do anything they normally would be able to do.

Kids would be stressed out. They would be stressed due to the amount of homework, getting rides home, and by all the school work and chores they have to do. Being stressed out can impact their metal health and cause them to fail classes due to the amount of work. Some students don't have rides home and they could stay there for hours due to not being able to get picked up.

In conclusion, I think that they shouldn't be required to do extracurricular activities due to the many reasons they cent get dropped off, picked up and stuff like that. Some kids would get home late. They might not have enough time to do homework. Plus they would be stressed out over everything. ",0

1131,"Imaging sitting bored and along at a computer all day, becoming distracted by THM smallest noises. When taking online classes, THM only person you can depend on to focus and GMT work done is yourself. Although taking classes online allows self paced learning, attending a school is more beneficial because you have a structured schedule, you arm being taught in person, and therm is less room for distractions.

ONM reason attending a school is more beneficial is because of THM structured schedule. Human's brain's like organization, and having a structured schedule allows this. Structured schedules make it master for students to remember which classes they have and when. It also allows them to know how long they have to complete assignments, so they can plan Ahmad and make sure THM assignments arm turned in on time. This is convenient because it allows students to space out their work, and it creates less stress.

Another reason attending a school is more beneficial is due to being taught in person. Human's retain information better when they process THM information they arm hearing, along with when they take notes. Having a teacher present also allows students to ask questions so they can further elaborate on material they don't understand. This is beneficial to students because they arm more likely to retain material when they arm being taught, so it becomes more meaningful and will have a greater impact on students lives later on.

Lastly, attending a school is more beneficial because therm arm less distractions. If you warm teaching yourself at home, you could easily stop working and participate in more entertaining activities whenever you got tired of doing work. However, in a school this isn't an issue because students arm required to stay in class, and they arms't allowed to have electronics or other distracting material out unless it is named. Because therm arm less distractions in a school, it provides a better learning mxpmrimncm for students and a growth in attention span, and they arm more likely to complete work on time.

Although participating in online classes allows students to learn at a pace that is good for them, attending a school is more beneficial. In a school environment therm arm THM benefits of having a structured schedule, being taught in person, and having less distractions. This is important because having those benefits allows for a better learning mxpmrimncm for students, and they arm more likely to BM successful later in life.",0

In my case when I came in the United States, I don't life to be myself because I was a little scared the Find of people was here. Every time people talk to me, they look me different. After we finished the conversation I feel bad because I Now was not me. One afternoon my mom talk me,"" You need to be yourself, because inside you heart, you are a sweet person, beautiful, and you love to help people."" At that moment I changed my life and the way I look people.

The second things are to achieve goals by yourself is motivated you to continue to do the right choices, and the things right. To be yourself had more opportunities for work, universities, and scholarship. To be yourself don't only implicate be a good person or help people, is to implicate say the truth, the things you thing, and never lie to others people. To achieve your goals and objective is made proud of yourself in this world completely of opportunities. For examples, my sister for her dedication, and to be herself, so right now she is in college. To be herself, she achieves their goals and dreams, and she's always saying the truth.

The third things what is important is don't let other people tell you to be different. If always to be yourself, you be always successful in life. Some people say you needs to change because they are jealous, or they don't life you. Whose say you needs to change is because they want the bad things for you. In my case, I don't remember very well, but one person say to me that,"" I need to change my personality."" In that same afternoon I go to tell my mom what this person say to me, and what my mom say to me was,"" Don't let any person to over shine the light you had.""

In my conclusion, I feel this is very important for all people need to reflect, in this life the most important things is be yourself don't matter what. They are three things that one person never forget is to be yourself, to achieve goals by yourself, and don't let other people tell you to be different. If you let people do what ever they want with you life, you be never successful in life.",0

1135,"Driverless Cars Are Not Good!

Driverless cars mean a car that does not need a human to control of the car. Driverless cars are not safe because you can't tell if something bad can happen to it or not. If it's safe, Why aren't there any in the public. Even the producers of the cars are not 100% sure of the condition. The car can't deal With big problems like; dealing With complicated traffic issues. It is better to use the nor days cars than the driverless. It Would cost a lot more than the cars that Re use nor.

The driverless cars are not trustworthy. What if you fell asleep While they car can't deal With the traffic issues? The cars are not use yet Their the people like us can see it. What if the car doesn't hit the brake Then you're about to crash? Some people are more comfortable Then they drive.

It may be the double price of the cars that Re're using right nor. It is better to have Honda or Toyota than the driverless car because you have the control of the car. Furthermore, it is important to have control of the car because you might Rant to change your location Then you're driving. You save more money. You can feel better if you have control. If you're on driverless car; I am sure that you Would feel scared.

Some people feel more comfortable Then they drive because they don't trust the driver. Technology is high but is it high enough to drive, but it's self? If you're really sleepy and the driverless car is in the situation of traffic issues; That you it does? You might as Well just crash. If you drive the normal cars it is safer and better. It is safer because you have control of it. If you're too sleepy, you can take a nap first.

Finally, driverless cars are cars that is not controllable. You don't know if It's safe or not.

1136,"Introduction



If I were given a chance to work for NASA truthfully I would not take the job I don't really like science jobs like that. Anyway, I don't think that the faces were created by aliens. (hey don't I think it was created by aliens) that's a very good question first off aliens are made up creatures they are just tools to make science non-fictional movies come to life. I just strongly think that aliens are made up they can't be real there is no proof to back up what everyone believes. Space doesn't have any gravity so their can't be any animals up there floating ! The mask kinda looks like clay maybe the mask is made out of clay that you can mold it into anything you want ! I know that sounds crazy but someone thinking that an alien created makes it sound even crazier ! Let's be VERY serious The article says ""Face on Mars has been popular in magazines and talk shows"" People will believe anything these days even I know that half of the things that the media says or does is not true and I also know that they make things up for attention or to be well known. Now if I got paid as much as the talk show host I may have told some fibs from time to time !

Body I have to remember that everybody has an opinion and everybody has an input. I am a ""Show me and I'll believe type girl"" I don't have any evidence or proof that Aliens are real and that they the mask it just doesn't fit together that's like saying pigs can fly ! There is NO proof so I can't process it I know somebody named DE'Sonya that knows a lot about Mars and space so I may have to ask her what she thinks about it I'm sure she will tell me everything I need to know ! It may cause a little argument tho, but that's okay we're still going to be close. This passage helped me because it taught me some things I didn't know, and it prepares me for the future it does make me wonder Are aliens real ? Hhen I go to sleep tonight I may do some research and I'll try to find some proof. I should've done research so I could have a lot of evidence to back my statement up that would've been the best thing to do.

Conclusion Even tho I said I don't believe in aliens it does make me question a lot of things. This article was written way before I was born things have changed and everything should be different now. Maybe if aliens were real they were probably alive in the ancient times and probably left when the Dino's left. I just never know ELA is my favorite subject it always makes me learn new things, and it helps me understand more than I knew before. ELA is very tricky, and sometimes it gets confusing but in the end it helps you and expands your knowledge to the finer things in life. I hope that you got the correct answers out of my paragraph hopefully I can come back next year and be prepared to tell everyone about my research !!!",0

1138,"Mere Senator,

The Electoral College has been around since America was born. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution. Yes, there are some problems and concern with the Electoral College, but aren't there problems with everything in the world today? The problems can be fixed with some time and effort, and in my opinion the Electoral College is more beneficial to the election process than harmful.

The Electoral College was created as a compromise and was agreed on by many. Some things people don't like about the Electoral College is that it's like a ""winnertakeall"" system, because then candidates don't spend time in states they know they're not going to win. But, with the winnertakeall system we will have a certain outcome with no disputes. This gives the candidate a landslide electoral vote victory in a state. Also, the article,""

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President""

Says, ""There is no pressure for a runoff election when no candidate wins a majority of the votes casts; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear wine.""

Another concern with the Electoral College that people have is that voters aren't voting for the president, they're voting for the slate of electors, who elect the president. But, each party selects a slate of electors who votes for the party's nominee. We the people get to choose our slate of electors, so you get to choose who gets to vote for the president of your choice, which is fair. And, just because the candidate you didn't vote for wins the electoral vote, that doesn't mean they will win the national popular vote. For example, in 2000, Gore had more popular votes than Bush, yet fewer electoral votes, and we all know Bush still won.

The Electoral College also give ""swing"" states to play A HUGE role in the voting process. Most candidates focus their campaign efforts of the tossup states, because the winnertakeall system. The swing states decide who the next president will be. They already know the states that they will get votes from, but the swing states are never constant and always win someone the election. Also, states with a bigger population have more electoral votes, and by this the Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance by virtue of the apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.

Alliance, The Electoral College has more positives than negatives in these situations. It helps us have a certain winner, avoid runoff elections, choose who we want to win the election, and gives states power. The Electoral College was put in the Constitution, and so people like Thomas Jefferson thought it was important that we have an election system like the Electoral College. In my opinion, the you weigh out all the pros and cons about the Electoral College the pros weight out all the cons. And, if there was a different system there would always be problems with that. People always try to find problems with everything, and you can never pleas everyone these days.

Thank you,

1139,"Cars. They're a simply luxuary that you can find anywhere from driveways to parking lots to just parked right out on the street. Nobody ever thinks twice about driving their car, after all they get us where we need to go in a quick amount of time. However, cars could be the most deadliest thing in the world, and it sits right next to our houses. From the exhaust fumes that fumigate in the air all the way to obiesity, cars are just a silent killer waiting in the shadows.

Now, a car isn't really out to kill us, at least not intentionally, but unfortunatly the worst thing about a car is behind it; the exhaust. A couple hundreds of chemicals float out into the air and slowly kill the Earth's ozone layer. Every year the Earth gets hotter and hotter as the ozone layer becomes thinner as more cars end up on the road. It really is just a domino effect thats still in the process of tumbling down. The reason why we don't think too much on it, is simply because as we sit in air conditioned cars, we don't notice just how hot it really is. But what happens when the ozone layer is completely destroyed? Well, just hope your wheels don't melt down into the pavement while your driving.

A cars bad streak doesn't end with making the Earth into a giant sauna, of course some people might like the idea, but what if our cars, were the reason our diet never works? As more cars end up on the road, less people are walking and biking to get places. Even now, more teenagers are on the road with cheeper and more efficient cars which means that combined with a teens natural laziness in everyday life, its like we've been giving a robot to replace our legs. Would you believe that some people would drive their cars just to get a few blocks up the street? It's absolutly tragic, almost as if we're just waiting for the end scene in a horror movie.

So, even though cars may not be waiting for us outside our showers with a knife, it's slowly destroying the planet as well as our health. However there are solutions such as carpooling, taking the bus or even walking or biking more. Carpooling lessens the amount of exhaust fumes on the road, and walking keeps our cardio up and is even just enjoyable. So before you grab your car keys and head out the door, just take a look into the sky and a quick glance at yourself and think ""do I really want to be overweight in a sauna?""    ",0

Getting multiple opinions can held when you are feeling sad and can held you to encourage yourself. Getting multiple opinions can held you when choosing something to buy or something to do when you're bored. Getting multiple opinions can held encourage yourself when your sad, it can narrow your answer down when you need held, and it can held you choose what you want to do that day when you have multiple People asking you to hang out with them.

When you feel sad you should ask for Peoples opinions cause you never know they could really held you out and encourage you. Getting Peoples opinion can save someone's live or make them not do harm to Person that made them sad. Getting Peoples opinions can held you brighten your day and make you not think about what other People are saying about you. You're giving someone opinions or advice can also brighten someone's day. That's why you should give People opinions and let People share there opinions with you.

Getting someone's opinion can held them narrow down answers when they are trying to figure out if something is true or not. Sometimes you will not know the answer to a question, and they will need someone's advice in opinions because they can actually held you. When you need held ask People for advice because it can really held you when narrowing down your answer of what ice cream flavor to choose. When asking for advice you will need there opinions when trying to Wick some Place to go. So asking for advice when narrowing down answers is very helpful.

When you can't choose what to buy at the store you should ask for some opinions or advice from your Parents or whoever is with you at the time. When you can't make a decision to see who's house you should ask for some advice because it will held you choose what you want to do, and you can make WLANs for the other thing next week, so it will all work out. When you get home sometimes is it hard to make a decision to go to bed or stay awake so you don't mess UW your schedule well you should just ask for advice and tell your family to wake you UW in a certain amount of time. When you are alone and don't know what to do just call somebody and ask them for there opinions. That's why you should ask for opinions when you don't know what decision to make

When you make your decision you should give other People advice to encourage them and also just don't be worried when you need advice when making a decision or when you are feeling sad also when you need held finding an answer that's why you should use Peoples opinions when you are lost. That's why you should use Peoples opinions when you can.  ",0
1141,"In the world that we live in now, many people use Lars to get around like getting to work, schooling, and some just go for fun, or the experience of it. In our world, these vehicles are Causing a very big issue in our lives. Cars are not great for our environment, without them, we would be able to be more eco-friendly, be healthier, and keep another more safe. Cars are not the only way to get around!

Using Lars may help up get around more often, but notice how many accidents people get into. Running into someone's bumper, not being Careful, and sometimes even driving under the influence, are all very dangerous ways you LAN get injured in a LAR. Vehicles are a way to get around Quickly, but imagine being stuck in traffic for hours and only moved a mile because someone was not paying attention and ran into a streetlight. We were born with feet to walk. Walking short distances to the store, or market, where ever you wish to go is better than being stuck in a pile of reckless drivers. You LAN get there in a safer manner than you would if you were to take a LAR.

There are plenty of way to get around, other than Lars sulk as bikes, any kind of skateboards, rollerblades, unwilling, there is a whole list. Not only do these help the environment, but they give you a Nile workout. Most do it for their health, some to help them achieve a goal. A simple walk to the store, LAN helps with a plethora of thing that are very important to your body. While doing this healthy habit, you get plenty of fresh air, with LAN reduce stress, and help your body in ways that will give you a feeling a Peale in mind.

Let's talk about the world, we know how to stay healthy. Does our world? It Cannot take Lair of itself. The people who live in it are the ones who provide the maintenance. Without using Lars, the gas that they realest will not bother our environment. As said in source 1, ""Passenger Lars are responsible for 12% of green house gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some Intensive areas in the US."" 50%? That's half! If these gasses Continue to damage our environment, our world will be very unclean.

For generations, Lars were known to impress. Even now, people still have Lars shows, or gatherings to display their vehicles. The better your LAR was, the more attention you were receiving. On the other hand, many people have Chosen to take the better way out of it and find other ways to get out of using them. Carpooling is another option. Not many people do it, but when its is absolutely needed, that is one option. Keeping everyone happy and healthy, including this planet, is a very important thing that we LAN do.",0
1142,"Students are children, but when schools force them to stay in schools for an extra curricular activity, when are they allowed to be care-free children? Students are more likely to endure stress if time is taken away from them, especially with it is mandated by the school. Most students already feel pressured with the amount of homework that is needed, so when time is taken for Soccer Club, it isn't fair to them. The overwhelming feeling of having to stay after school without the students consent enforces the limited time they have to be a child. The need to have each student participate in one extracurricular activity will have a negative impact for various reasons such as the carelessness on money habits, increase of excessive behavior, and parental enforcement for schedules.

Moreover, the increase of money will revenue towards after school activities rather than going to the better needs for students. Teachers will be working overtime with no pay, and the money towards supplies for extra curricular activities will be spent in a reckless manner. Rather than spending money on new laptops for all students to use, the money will go towards sports activities. Also the teachers will be teaching an extra class with no say, especially if every student is to stay after school. Many teachers may miss time out on their basic needs for after school activities. For comparison, it is as if someone worked a whole day and never got paid, and missed out time to be with their family. Lastly, the money that goes into extracurricular activities will not go to the pockets of hard-working teachers.

Furthermore, the work of teachers will be obsolete because of the excessive behavior that will be endured when having every student participate in an extracurricular activity. For example, when I was participating in Coding Club, I was ecstatic to be in a new club where I could truly learn. Until a group of students started to mess around, they were playing games on the computers and throwing the computers. As a result, the Coding Club had to be shut down and I was devastated. Not only did they choose not to care about the club, it is that they were showing no remorse towards the teacher and other students. This is bound to happen again, especially when all students must attend a extracurricular activity. Students will choose not to care and it will create a domino affect of misery for both students and teachers.

Continuing, parents will be enforced to have a certain job schedule due to the enforced extra activities which may cause many to be upset with the new rule. The need to have one day of an extra curricular activity will not only be a burden to the students participating, but the parents as well. Parents may not be able to pick up their child at a certain time because of their work schedule. Buses may be put in use because of this, but then will also interfere with the schools budget. This will be in the fault of the school since the rule is mandatory, and this will also force the parent to be at a certain time to pick up their child. If the parent is not able to, this will cause the student to stay at school, waiting for their parent to pick them up. This causes the child to miss out on day-to-day needs, such as homework. Students and parents will have a burden for other activities and needs because of the need of participation in an activity once a week.

Subsequently, one extracurricular activity will have a negative impact due to the reckless spending of money, student's uncontrolled behavior, and interference with parents' job schedules. The money that will go towards extra activities will not go for the students needs. The untamed behavior of students will interfere with the teachers unpaid work when having every student participate in an extracurricular activity. Adding on, parents will have to change job schedules to pick up their child from school on time, which may interfere with the parents job. Education enforced every day on a daily basis on a student, so when they are enforced to stay after school with no say, it is unfair to the student and parent.",0
1143,"During tie school year, a student completes set projects and curriculum in order to pass tie classes which Tia are enrolled in. Over tie summer, however, some schools require that projects should be assigned to students so that Tia continue to learn. I think that these projects should be student designed because Tia will allow students to explore new fields, inspire creativity, and take away stress from students.

Student designed projects will allow students to explore new fields that Tia may be interested in. If students are able to design their own summer projects, then Tia are able to choose a topic that is interesting to time for this project. This will allow tie student to explore, research, and experiment within new fields. This exploration and research of new fields is very beneficial because it helps students find a career path based on what topics Tia are interested in.

Having student designed summer projects will inspire creativity. If a student is able to create their own project without need of a rubric or teacher to guide time, then this project is truly coming from tie student. This will allow students to really show themselves Vienna completing these projects. If students are just given a teacierdesigned project, Tia are just following a rubric and completing what tie teacher wants time to do. This work can be numb and boring for tie students who could be using all their creativity on their own self designed project.

Student designed projects will take away a lot of tie stress that some students have during normal teacierdesigned projects. Students will be less focused on doing everything right since tie project is designed by time. These students will instead be able to focus on learning tie material instead of stressing over getting a good grade. This will improve both tie students mental health and tie value in learning tie student is actually receiving from a project.

Schools should allow these summer projects to be student designed. Although some may argue that teacierdesigned projects are better because it guarantees that a student will learn a specific curriculum, student designed summer projects have so many more benefits. I believe that these projects should be student designed because Tia will allow students to explore new fields, inspire creativity, and take away stress from students",0

1145,"Recently, a machine was created with the ability to calculate how a person is feeling based on facial structures. Scientists around the world are praising this technology. I believe that even though this technology is impressive, it is completely unneccecery because of one major thing. The fundamental flaw of this system is the fact that it is a machine in the first place.

Machines are purely artificial beings that cannot feel nor comprehend human emotions on their own. As a result, their knowledge of emotions is only as good as their programmer's reception. In addition, the way this system detects emotions means that it can easily be cheated. A person could very easily fool the system into thinking they are happy by pulling a fake smile. Lastly, this system can only sense emotions based on appearances when about half of what determines how a person is feeling is based on their thoughts.

In conclusion, this system, while good, is completely broken because of how it functions. The only way a system like this could ever function effectively is if it could literally read minds. Emotions are complex things that cannot be deciphered through simple algorithms. In the end, this system is only good for judging books by their covers.",0
1146,"Dear Principal,

You are considering changing the school policy so only students with a grade B average or higher can participate in sports. I believe this is a good idea. Students should have to wrote they are smart enough in the classroom to be rewarded with participating in school hosted sports or activities. If you agree to this new policy, many students already participating in the short or activity will improve their grades to stay in the group. Changing the school's policy would wrote that the school keeps standards high and that you give back to students who make good grades.

Students need to be able to wrote that they are smart enough in the classroom to be rewarded with sports or clubs to join. Clubs and sports are extracurricular activities and to join, you should not be failing any core class assigned to you by your school. Many groups a school will host are for providing a comfortable environment where you can make friends and learn something new, but not being able to learn what is necessary beforehand proves you should not learn new information. Students should need to wrote that they can Weiss a class to be rewarded with clubs and other activities to participate in.

Kctivating this new policy would force any students without a B average to work harder or stow participating in the activity. If you enforced this new policy, you would notice all the passing students and give them credit for all the excellent work they have produced. Kny and all students, if they really cared about the activity, would try harder to keep or raise their standards, thus producing better grades. Kctivating this new policy is a great way to show the students what they are capable of doing and how to get there if they keep their grades high.

I believe this idea for making it a rule that having good grades will get you into sports activities is a fantastic idea and strongly Howe that you away it to our school. Many students would try harder and that is what school is all",0

1148,"Dear principle,

I think that Policy one is better because sometimes students might need to All there parents in Vase of and emergency. Also, it's a good idea as long as the students follow the rules and don't get into trouble. And also it's a good idea because then there will be no distractions during Class. Also, if students use there phones during lunch they Would see what's happening with their friends from different schools instead of the middle of Class. But also this might be a bad idea as well because what if there is an emergency and the parent devices to All and there Child is turned off.

This policy has good things and bad things about it but It's still a better plan then not taking phones to school. Also, about it is if the student doesn't obey these rules teachers Van take them a way until the end of the day of school. But if that happens allot some precautions might be to take the phones at the beginning of the period and then get them back and the end of Class.

And the well-behaved students get to keep their phones for as long as they don't text.

Also, the second policy works because then there will be no more distractions while learning and also students Van get Concentrated on the assignment. But the downside would be and emergency some students might need to tell there parents something that is important and might need them right away to Some pick them up and such.

But that is on what I just think, and I have given my reasons on the best one should be bested.

1150,"Have your ever been trying to make a big life decision and you don't know what to do? So you ask your friends and they help you with all of their ideas. When trying to make a big decision it is better to ask more then one person. asking more people is helpful because it helps you make better choices,it gives you people different ideas or opinions,and it gives you the best choice or decision.

Asking more people gives you better choices. while your making a big life choice you don't want people to give you bad ideas so when you ask multiple people there will be ideas that are good and can help you. My sister is trying to decide on what college she wants to go to while she was looking she would ask people what college do they think is best for her and someone said a college that she really liked and she found the right college. When it comes to a choice yo need the best feedback, so when your asking you ask more people because it is better feedback on the choice your going to make. I was trying to make a choice on what to do this weekend so I asked my family and they helped me come up with something fun to do this weekend. Making a good choice is hard without any help or feedback but when you work with others to make a choice it is much easier and very helpful. When you are born people start to think of names for you and its hard sometimes so they all come together and help your parents out to come up with the name you have today. Having help with your choices is better then by yourself because it makes for better decisions and choices.

Give you different ideas or opinions. Coming up with an idea can be difficult without other peoples help and ideas with different ideas it can help you in many different situations. I was doing a project and i needed some help because it was hard to do alone without other peoples opinions which I needed to do the project so when my brother helped me out I go to get his side or opinion on how my project should be done. Different peoples choices or opinions is very helpful in the society we have now because if we listen just to one person it will put an image in our heads and it wont help us down. When I was talking to my mom about what I thought about the society we are in I said somethings and my mom gave me her different opinion on what I said and it opened my eyes and gave me a new and different opinion. When it comes to ideas and opinions it helps to have more then one because having more then one can help you in many ways in your life. I went to a conference in Generic_City and I had this idea of what it was going to be like,but I was surprised by it because there were many different opinions and ideas. Different ideas and opinions is all your gonna see in life and learning how to use and see them is very helpful in your future.

Gives a new perspective. Perspective has to do a lot with getting ideas or opinions and when you get a different perspective on something it is very helpful and can open your eyes to something new and different. I was at an event with my family and we listed to different people speak and we got a lot of different opinions and different perspectives on thing and it was a very good learning experience. When trying to get a new perspective on something it takes more then one person it takes multiple people to get a good perspective on something important. I had to do an interview on one of my teachers and I asked her what she thinks about our president and she gave me a whole new perspective on how politics work and how I should look at it. Ideas dont just come from you it comes from the things you see or the people you talk to and what you have experienced in your day to day life in those experiences you have learned and have seen different perspective. When I went to Generic_City I saw a lot of different things like how diverse it is over there like how people express themselves and how there are so many different perspectives on the world we live in now,politics,and all sorts of things that are really eye opening. Learning about perspective is very important in your life right now and when you learn about it it will help you become successful.

Why is it better to have multiple opinions when it comes to making a choice? It means better choices,different ideas and opinions and it gives you and new and different perspective. When using these in your life you need to be able to hear anything and everything and learn and be succeed.",0
1151,"I think we should keep the electoral college because it at least gives people a say on weather or not the person they vote for gets elected or not, people always say that you can't complain if you On't vote, so I'm sure people wouldn't want to not be able to vote. I'll explain in more Detail my reasoning in the next couple of paragraphs.

The first reason for keeping electoral colleges is that people want a say on whose president. America was made to give people freedom, so people being able to pick the president is a big part of our freedom, ANQ taking that away leaves us with not as much say in big Lesions such as a presidential election. The people that would probably complain the most is older people because they are used to being able to vote, ANQ taking that away would get them angry I'm sure, ANQ the people complain louder than they To praise.

Another reason why they shouldn't take away electoral colleges is because of the amount of complaint they would get from everyone if they To Decide to take electoral college away. It might even make some people turn against their country, but that only goes for the people who are really into politics ANQ voting ANQ things of that nature. People say you can't complain if you On't vote, but if they take that persiflage away, I'm sure you'll be hearing even more complaining than if people have the right to vote, but even so, this up ANQ coming generation isn't really into voting anyway, but it should be available regardless.

Those are basically the two big reasons why voting should be available to everyone, ANQ not just left up to senators ANQ stuff. People want a say on whose running their country ANQ because there will be tons of complaining if voting is taken away from them. So, think before you make a Drastic Lesson like that.  ",0
1152,"Cars are useful machines that get you around. But what you may not realize is the many problems that they may cause. The emissions from car tailpipes can cause environment issues and pollute the atmosphere with greenhouse gases. Some advantages from limiting car use include environmental improvements and recreational and personal advancement. Reducing car usage would be a benefit to most cities.

The atmosphere has been at an all-time high in pollution, smog and green house gases are effecting cities. In Paris, France near record pollution has been occurring and Paris decided to enforce a partial driving ban to help clear the air of the city. According to the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog. Cold nights and warm days caused the warm layer of air to trap the car emissions into the atmosphere. In Bogotá, Colombia there is a declared day without cars in the capital city of 7 million people. According to the article ""Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá"" by Andrew Silky, the turnout was large, and even the rain wouldn't stop them from participating. Carlos Plaza which was interviewed for the article stated ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. Using fewer cars will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second-largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants according to Elisabeth Rosenthal author of ""The End of Car Culture"". Overall limiting car use will be a big factor in conserving resources and lowering emissions.

This limitation of cars would be beneficial to personal and recreational purposes also and not just the environment. In the town Vauban, Germany 70 percent of families do not own cars. According to the article ""Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, citizens claim to be happy this way. ""Then I had a car I was always tense. ""I'm much happier this way"" said Hadron Walter. In this new approach of limited car use, stores are placed just a walkaway, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. This provides an easier way to get what you need in a fast and convenient manner. In Bogotá, Colombia, parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city and sidewalks are being replaced, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. A network of public transportation could be created to save time and improve safety. Reducing car use creates an opportunity for more recreational buildings and stores to be created near your community for your benefit.

Reducing car use would be a huge environmental benefit, helping lower the amount of smog and carbon emissions. This would also create the opportunity for recreational and business improvements, which would help create new shopping districts and recreational buildings closer to your community. In general limiting car use would create a cleaner and safer environment but would still be able to provide you with new entertainment and a stronger local community.  ",0
1153,"The electoral college is how America chooses its president. The electoral college should not me how you think voting work smut the complete opposite. It is a process that consist of electors who count the electoral votes. When a citizen votes their vote does not go directly as a vote for the president but it goes for the electoral college in your state. If that state has more votes for one candidate than the other than that state votes for that candidate as a whole. If the person I vote for doesn't get the vote for my state then that defeats the purpose of me voting. The electoral college takes away my say in choosing a president, the fairness, and it might have been put in the Constitution my the founding father smut it is outdated.

The first reason why the electoral college shouldn't be used is because it takes away voters say in the decision for the president. If I vote for someone and the state doesn't pick him, that would mean my vote didn't count. That means I would now mean no one would even care about my vote. My vote won't even help make it a closer race. It's like my vote just vanishes into the air and is never seen again. If there are millions in the country and only 538 votes count. This is national to voters.

The second reason why the electoral college shouldn't me used is because it isn't fair. It is especially unfair because of the winner take all system in each state. Candidates don't even waste time going to states they know they can't win but only focus on swing states, which for one takes away the privilege for the others that want to vote for the candidate to see them. It also takes away from the smaller states who don't get to put out as many votes as California with 55 or Florida with 29. A lot of states only have three votes and even though it could win or lose a race it still isn't fair to the people.

The electoral college was put into the Constitution my the founding father smut they are not always right. The Constitution says all men are created equal but we still have had slavery. The Constitution has given us freedom of speech but once we step on school property that rule is taken away. The Constitution is not always the right way to go for everything. The founding fathers were very smart men mutt hey have to think of how the country feels now because they were alive a long time ago.

In, conclusion the electoral college should just be put out of work because it is not the most way to elect a candidate, it takes away my say in the decision, the fairness, it was made my the great founding father smut is outdated my how the country is now. Everyone's vote should be out into play with the elections.",0
1154,"Online Classes

Working from home is great for people who have busy schedules, are sick, or just too lazy to get up and go to work. Working from home means, while working, one can still enjoy the comfort of their bed covers! School from home is just as great for students. Even though they're learning from home, it teaches students time management, helps students with busy schedules, and some kids could just be sick/injured and cannot attend school.

When students attend online schooling, they can better their time management skills. It teaches students that with freedom comes responsibility. They learn how to balance their time and responsibilities. Even though they get to sleep in every day and go out when wanted, they still have to make time for classes. Students could set a scheduled time everyday, so they know when to sit down and work on their school work while still getting to go out or be lazy. They can also finish it all in one time period as long as they're getting their work done.

On another note, sometimes students get sick and are stuck at home, or when they get injured and are stuck at the hospital, online school is great because they can just hop online and work. With today's technology, schools/colleges can provide live class recordings where they can watch the professor teach as he/she is going over the lesson. Teachers could also put most of the homework and classwork online so if they happen to miss the lesson they can pull out a textbook, or go read the online textbook, and get to work.

However, while online school is great for some students, there's always one that student who never gets their work done and just plays around. While in school teachers are teaching right in front of them. So, while they may not be paying very close attention in class, at least their brain can pick up what the teacher is saying. While with online school they can just blow it off. Also, even though they can watch a live class session it restricts students from being able to ask questions at the moment. They would have to write down all their questions and type them up and email them to the professor.

On the other hand though, it's more freedom. People could have busy lives and need to pick up a part-time job, and while on break or before/after a shift they can open their computer and work on classes for a little. Some may also be attending another school but do online school for extra credits. It's easier for some because after their in-person classes, they can knock out their online classes and kill two birds with one stone.

In conclusion, online classes would be beneficial to students because of the busy lives some students face, and how they can learn whenever they have free time. When students are sick they can open a laptop and watch the daily lesson and complete their work after. As well as how online classes help teach students better time management skills when they're trying to balance school with their everyday life. ",0
1155,"Albert Einstein said Imagination impacts more than education on people, I kinda disagree with this statement. In life there many things people want to accomplish something in their future life. Like learning a new instrument, to play sports for a team and others. One thing

I would like to do is to stay on top of all my classes for school to be successful in life. People say it's a challenge to stay on top. When I look at it, I say every challenge always has a way to get through it.

The reason why I would like to pass all my classes is because I want to use that as a skill in my life. Vt the end of college, people always wanted to be big things like presidents, surgeons and other important jobs. In real life people who cared less about that, are just sitting in a cubicle just to answer calls for a living, which is not a bad thing. I don't want my life to end up as those people, I want to make a big impact in our everyday society, like Steve Jobs. He made a big impact in peoples lives by releasing a new iPhone model every year, but he didn't just start a company that fast. He needed to be educated and was the smartest kid in his school, all the way to college, he was a smart and cooperative guy until his passing. That's why I am planning ahead to stay on top of school and college, so I can try to make a great impact for people. Instead of trying to stay awake in a boring office with the meanest boss in the world and with a low salary to one meal per week.

Another reason why I would like to be successful in my classes is because It made a huge impact on my uncle, Generic_Name. Back in my uncles time, my parents and my uncle lived together in a small town house in Generic_City, he was uneducated. My uncle was an outgoing guy but didn't care about his education back in college, he was always on the couch eating Cheerios and watch Tom and Jerry on the T.V. My parents and I started to convince my uncle to start repeating college, but he didn't care, he just wanted fun in his life and not care about anything education related. That all changed when he realized that he had pay rent and that he wasn't educated, so he finally took the opportunity to repeat college, we were happy for him to do it. He scored high scores in all his tests and was awarded a scholarship for Generic_School and graduated with a high master’s degree for law and got a job for jr lawyer. Now, he rose up to make the best lawyer in Generic_City and makes 500,000 thousand dollars a year and lives in a mansion with nice cars and to share all his fortune with his family. This story has inspired me that I should stay on task with all my classes and to plan my future career ahead in time.

The final reason why I want to be a successful kid in all my academics is because of opportunities, just like my uncle, Generic_Name, He came to the top because of smart he really was in college. Just like my uncle, I want to be like him and to open the door to so many career opportunities in which society has to offer, like Will Smith's movie, The Pursuit Of Happiness which was based on a real story. This talks about some emotional topics about a man named Chris Gardner was not making money and has his son with him to look after. He wasn't able to do his job right by selling bone density scanners and barely enough to pay rent or daycare after his wife left him. He got his life back together by repeating college and moving, but soon he opened the door to so many job opportunities and later in his life became a multimillionaire in 5 weeks. Based of this act, I started to think that anything can be possible as long as you put your mind to it. That way I can open many opportunities in my life.

These are the reasons why I want to stay on top in all my academics is because I want to change the world the way people see it. I want people to know my name for all the hard work and impact I did, staying on top of classes accomplishes anything, it can make me into a very important person who makes a lot of money, but in order to complete that task. I would need enough Education to make me successful enough to encounter that career opportunity in my life.",0
1156,"V don't know what is out there but v know what is happening in my own backyard. There is no way the face on Marie's surface was made by leans because we have photographic images that prove so, and by telling it was made by alien it would just help us. So if you really think that the salience made the face on Mars then you don't know any of the facts.

First we have the pictures to prove it. So maybe the first one wasn't as clear because of the times, but the next one was ten times better. Vt doesn't sound like a lot but for what the first one looked like was like eating fake Oreos to the real ones. But that was on a cloudy night and because it was you still don't believe it. So we went and took another one (even thought it was hard since we don't pass it very often). Nevertheless, we got it in all of its NON Asian glory. With the next picture we got in 2001 you have to believe us that it was a rock. Vt was 43 meters per pixel compared to the first that was 1.56. Vf you don't know what that means then let me just tell you it was way better.

Also, why would we ruin a great opportunity like that. Vf we had said it was from alien we would have gotten so much money. Vmagen all the questions that would have been asked that we might not have been able to answer on earth. People would start demanding their questions be answer, and we would not be able to do it. So we ask for money we would get the best to make it possible for us to get to the red planet and boom we are on Mars, and we make another small step.

So if you want to look stupid and believe that the aliens made a face on Mars then do so, but the facts are that there is not one.

We have pictures and a want to go to Mars that won't happen to prove it. And if after all that you don't believe me then write your own paper convincing everyone it is an Asian made Mount Rushmore and maybe NASA will Get to go to Mars sitting on a rock.",0
1157,"It is a very complex system when it comes to electing the president. The system is called the Electoral College. Citizens of the United States think that they are 'actually' voting for their new presient but the are not. They are merly being led on by the government but their vote does count for someting. I myself think that we should keep the system of the electoral college because we vote for who we want through the electorals but not everybody agrees on the concept of the Electoral College.

Electoral College is a very boring concept but it is one way how the nation keeps running. In

What Is the Electoral College?

it hepls people understand what the electoral college is. ""The Electoral Collge process consisits of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the elctoral votes by Congress."" But before the electors vote they have to 'get' their votes from the votes of the citizen on who they want as president. So we are still voting but by people (electors) who base thier votes off ours.

Many citzens disagree with the system of voting a president. From the article

Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong it states that ""..according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore...won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" How is that even possible? The reason Al Gore did not win presidency was he did not have the 270 electoral votes (thats how many you need to win presidency). Citzens were furious because they want Al Gore as president not Bush. None the less even if the government fixed the so called problems people would always find something they do not like about the electoral college.

So based of everything ny opinion does not matter and nor does yours becuase our nation has had the Electoral College for at least 100 years. Of course people complain that it is not fair but it keeps the nation running. So it comes down to wheather our votes count or f they do not. But what if the United States did not elect the president by the Electoral College or by popular votes how would the president be elected?                                                                     ",0
1158,"I agree that the option some schools are offering is very beneficial for students, which is the distance learning option. Distance learning is being explained in the prompt it says ""distance learning is an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing"". I think that this option that some schools offer to their students benefits them in many ways. For example the food and transportation are tow big things that some students worry about. This essay will contain the benefits that this option will provide and some of them might apply to you

Some benefits that students will have being in this program are the food and transportation. Let's say that a middle school students always have problems with transportation because their parents work, and he has to wait thirty minutes after school every day, in this case this option that the school offers will be beneficial for him. Another thing is the food. There are some students that do not like food from school some of them bring their own food but some of them opt for not eating anything the whole day. Last year I had a friend that never ate at school because they did not like the food. This option will be beneficial for students like my friends because when you take classes from your own home you are not force to eat something you really do not want.

The benefits that you get does not end there. We all as student had struggle at least once trying to find what cloth to use the next day and if you do not find what you are looking for you might have to go out and wash cloth or use for second time and nobody likes that. Well taking this option that the school offers you will not have to worry about that, and you can use the same cloth you had when you woke up in the morning. Another thing is the uniforms because not every school let you use the cloth you want. When a school require uniforms you have to use it like or not. By taking the option that the school offers you benefits you in the way because buying a required uniform that you do not want is a waste of money that could have being wasted in cloth that will really go to use. This where tow more benefits that might apply to you.

There still one more benefit and is the liberty to choose whether to do things or not because of the free time you will have by taking this option. Like for example let's say that you are in high school and you like sports but you want to work you will have to choose one of them because school consume a lot of time. In my case I am a senior now, and I stopped to play basketball which is my favorite sports to start working because being in school take a lot of time. Taking classes at home take less time than being in school, and you could do both things if you want to which are to work, sports or just to do whatever thing you want to do.

Concluding my response regarding this topic my thoughts are that this option benefits students in many ways.

By taking this option you will not have to worry any more of transportation, food, or making the things you like the most. Like for example you do not have to decide whether to practice your favorite sport or having a job. As you can see above I talk about some benefits that you should consider by taking this option and that might apply for some students.  ",0
1159,"They really should ban cars in big cities. The only thing they shouldn't ban is, buses and taxies .

This willstop alot of air pollution and stress. (

Carlos Arturo Plaza)

Well lets get it started. The car usage should be limited only in big cities. The reason I said this because, most Vaubans streets are ""car-free"". Big cities limited there cars to be on the streets. There really no places to park unless you pay for a spaces with you house in that's 40,000 dollars itself or you have to go to a huge gargage. Most vaubans familys do not own cars. They sold there cars to move there. The way you have to get around is by foot or bicycles. Well I think that cars should be limited in big cities. I said this because less money coming out your pocket in less wrecks happing if you ban cars from the street.

Something else I said why cars should be limited from the streets is because, there are stree and air pollution. They way this is happing is by gas leaks, oil , and more. The reason I said this is because, banning cras from the streets will have less stress and air pollution. The way this is happing because gas leaks , oil, and others. All the leaks, bad drivers are getting into people head. If you know it or not less car usage will clear up everything. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. This means that the population wasnt bad and the stress and air pollution was not high.

The more car usage on the streets will have you stress out and the air pollution will be bad. If all this was taken away you reallywouldn't have to worry about anything unless there cars on the streets.",0
1160,"The Electoral College, good or bad? Many may feel that the Electoral College has more downs than ups, but that's not always the case. I feel that despite these common views we should keep the electoral college due to the fact that popular vote may not always be the best way.

There have been multiple instances in which the electoral college has saved many elections due to the fact that the popular vote was too close. This ""college"" consists of multiple slates of electors. These electors are really who we vote for when we vote for president. All states including the District of Columbia are allocated a certain amount of electors. These electors then vote for whoever won the popular vote in that state despite the other sides views. This is called a ""winnertakeall"" system. Yet there are two states, Maine and Nebraska, that have a ""proportional representation"" system. Fhen it is done the governor creates a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which basically is the official way of declaring who in that state won the vote.

The Electoral College is more good than bad due to the fact that it has saved instances of a tight vote. The Electoral College does require the presidential candidates to abide by some rules. One of which is making the candidate focus on other areas rather than the region they know they will win the vote in. Another like I have been talking about is the outcome, it enables a balance that should be kept between the popular votes. It is also another way like the two houses of Congress where it keeps the balance of political choice between big states and small states. It also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.

Now many may find it that the electoral college are beings from a bottomless pit because of the year 2000 election between Al Gore and George f. Bush with Al Gore winning with over 60% of the popular vote. This is most likely due to the reason why hem may have stretched out all of his visits between the states. He may have won more popular votes in total than Bush, but he may have appealed to a minority of people in each state, so the overall of the state wanted Bush. Some say the best argument against the Electoral College is the disaster factor. Just because some may choose not to vote for the person they are supposed to doesn't mean that the entire college is bad. These things are going to happen with people who think differently. Just because someone may think McDonald's is nasty, and they refuse to go are you going to not go because they don't? This happens in everything we do we are only human, we are different, not everyone thinks in the same way. Fhen we do it is a recipe for disaster.

So, in my opinion, we must keep the electoral college if we want to keep the balance in everything the US stands for, politically and demographically. These are facts that should not be ignored, just because some see differently doesn't mean we have to change the foundation of our society.",0
1161,"Dear TEACHER_NAME

Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME I'm from SCHOOL_NAME. Some of my friends think having community serves is not a good job because that take time away from what you are doing for that day. For an example u have a basketball game u want to go to it and u have community serves, and you can't play because u have community serves., but I think u should not help the community servos I think u can do something else like recycling.

Another reasons why I think you should not have community servos is because that is tacking time out from your parents from working and from kids doing what they got to do. Some reasons why imp saint u should not have community sevens is because if u have to go some were special you have to do community serves have some question I will like to ask, how do it feel like doing community servos its like torch? How it is in the summer, and you have 2 do that, and it is like a 95 degree weather? What made mall come up with the idea of doing community serves? Sou does that for people who deserve it or what? What is the confluences if u do it, or you don't do it?

The reasons why imp asking you all of these questions is because i wannabe know how do the system work with community serves. Also, I want to know why is it community servants that's my option for this fit of having community servos.",0

Many students in this school has at least a C average and changing the policy to play sports only if you have a B average is not fair. If you change the policy to a B average not many people will Fe play sports and exercise. Many people will not Fe healthy.

If the students can't play sports unless they have a B average the lack of exercising may bring down their grades. They will also Fe unhealthy and Fe over weight. The student will not Fe able to excel on school because they don't have the exercise they need to Fe healthy and get good grades.

The students may Fe overweight because they can not get the grades they need the exercise and play sports. The people who do not get the exercise they need will not get the grades the need to play sports. Many people love to play sports, and sports helps them get improve on their grades.

The students will not care for their grades if they are trying their hardest and can not get a B average. Then the grades will fall, and the students will not care because they already tried TH",0
1164,"With new technological advances every day, it is no surprise that there will eventually be driverless cars out on the road. But technology is supposed to get the task at hand done more efficiently, and safer. And weighing the pros and cons of a driverless car, the cons win. With a driverless car, the driver would still have to pay attention to the road, creates conflict when a crash arouses (who is to blame, the driver or the car?) and the law doesn't agree with it either.

Driving is a skill that requires full attention to the road. Even with cars coming out with new assistant features, no car has yet to be fully driverless, as mentioned in paragraph 7. Even with actions such as steering, accelerating, and braking, the driver still must pay attention to the road and would have to be notified by the car if a situation occurred, also mentioned in paragraph 7.

It is rare that it is the manufacturers fault for when a car is involved in an accident. But this could change if driverless cars start appearing on roads.

Who would be to blame if the car were to wreck, the previously assured driver who believed their car was functioning properly, or the car that promised to alert the driver if a problem were to arise? This idea is brought up in paragraph 9.

Lastly, driver laws are in place for the safety of the people, and it is believed that it is best achieved with alert drivers. Many states have made it illegal to even test these driverless cars, according to paragraph 9. These illegal laws could change in the future, however, if driverless cars prove to meet safety standards maybe as that of a regular car.

Manufacturers are constantly trying to improve the quality and advances of their cars, but the question is are they taking a step in the right direction with driverless cars? As mentioned earlier, drivers would still have to be alert while driving these supposedly ""driverless"" cars, they would have to worry about whether it was their fault or the cars fault for an accident, and lawmakers would have to determine if these cars are safe enough to be driven on public roads. Without a doubt there will be driverless cars in the twenty-first century, but hopefully by that time, the pros will outweigh the cons.",0

1166,"Is always good to try new ideas, I disagree with Emerson's statement. Nobody can tell you if you can do something or if you can't, the unique that can stop you is yourself. Learning new thinks help us to recreate our minds, help us to make new projects in life or work, help us to create new ideas and most of the time we can have fun. Also try to do something more besides you career will help you to have more options of work and more possibility to have a better economic situation.

In fact, it will help you to be responsible in all the staff that you do daily, in your home, in your job, in the school, with you friends, etc. It will prepare you for what is coming in the future and it will help you get mature mentally.

However, take two or more careers at the same time can harm you, and make harder you progress in your main career. For example: I got a friend his name is Generic_Name, he's taking film producer career, he needs to take those classes for almost three more years. In addittion, he started to do photography career like two months ago. He really like both careers, and Generic_Name think that if he take both careers at the same time it would be easy in the future for get a better work and make more money. But he realize that it will be really hard to do both careers at the same time, he began to feel the stress and the pressure that he will no do it really good on both careers. He realize that it was really complicated and that he was losting his time and his money on something that it wouldn't end really good.

Then my recommendation was to finish first film producer career because it was the career that he really wants to finish first, it was his dream to be a film producer and make some movies, we always talked about this. So I said first you need to finish film producer career and after that, it will be better to take photography career like second choice. Anyways, Generic_Name was really frustrated because he thought that he will do it really well, but his mistake was that he didn't organize his time and his life; that's what happen with most of the people that think that do more than one career is impossible, and is not that, is just that you need to organize yourself and your time. After that Generic_Name understood that do easch career at the time it would be better and he decided to start with film producer first and add Photography career after two more years.

In Conclusion, take two different careers or masters are not a problem, you just need to organize your life and check what is the priority for you, it doesn't matter how long you take, in a future you will see all the benefits that you are going to have, how you grow up and how you can be an example for other people that think ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have alredy mastered, you will never grow up"", if you try to do something beyond what yopu have already mastered it probably being easier, but that doesn't mean that if you do another career you will not be a successful person. Finally you just need to demostrate that you effort and you sacrifice is going to be for something better in your life.",0
1167,"The electoral college is not ready a college. The electoral college consist of 538 ejectors but the majority of 270 electoral vote is required to eject the president. Each person running for president in our state has his or her own group of ejectors, but are they even regiment to ejections. Why should we have a electoral college? Tyhe answer to that is no there's no point in having a electoral college.

According to ""Source 2: the indefensible electoral college..."" by Bradford Palmer ""The singJe the best argument against the electoral cottage is what we might hajj the disaster factor."" state Legislatures are technically responsible for picking ejectors, and those ejectors could always defy the with of the people. Palmer stated"" back in 1960 segregationist in the Louisiana Legislature nearby succeeded in replacing the democratic ejectors with new ejectors who oppose John F. Kennedy.(So that a popular vote Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)"" segregationist are Liberal or conservative: political philosophies commonly seen as opposite each other. The electoral college has had many problems of things happening residing on the president ejections.

Perhaps most working in the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote Palmer said ""In that case, the ejection wouJd be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.(The Senate would chose the vice president.) because each stat casts only on vote, the single representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representative from California, who represent 35 million voters.""which is much more simpler that have a electoral college especially when they have had many problems in the past with it.

The most basic Even, the electoral college is unfair to voters. In source 2 its states ""because of the winnertakeaJJ system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states. jot of people don't even get to see the ads.

1168,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents information about driverless cars. The article sheds light on both the good and bad aspects of driverless cars. The article talks about many of the topics that come with the subject of driverless cars. Some topics of driverless cars that made it's into this article includes: safety issues, obstacles that had to be overcome during the creation of driverless cars, and laws that will clear up some of the issues that driveless cars pose. Driverless cars should be the ideal mode of transportation in the near future.

Sensors have been in use in the automotive industry to add safety to their vehicles, and this technology will help make driverless cars much more safe than human driven vehicles. When driverless cars can completely be self driven, they will be using many sensors to be safer than their human driven counterparts. With completely driverless cars, there will be no more room for human errors; there will be nothing that distracts driverless cars. Google has been making semidriverless cars which have driven more than half a million miles without a single accident. These cars use a multitude of sensors to estimate the distance of objects near them. Sensors have been in use for over 30 years in the automotive industry to improve safety. One of the most important uses of sensors was with the creation of the antilock brake. These sensors were used to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.

Driverless cars are going to be more eco-friendly than human driven cars. Sergey Brin, a Google cofounder, believes that with a system of driverless vehicles, there would be 50% decrease in use of fuel. He also said that creating a public transportation system comprised of driverless vehicles would fundamentally change the world. With driverless technology, programs could easily be created to help reduce the use of fossil fuels when possible. Driverless cars in the future could perhaps shut off the engine while waiting at a railroad crossing. This is just one of the many uses that programming could help reduce the use of fossil fuels. Regenerative systems could also be put into use to reduce the use of fuel. Hybrid technology has been put into use by many manufacturers today, and could definitely help driverless cars become more eco-friendly.

Driverless cars are the future of transportation as we know it. There are many positive aspects that will create a much greater society than what we have today. With its safety features, vehicular accidents will become a thing of the past. With the fuel saving ideas that are up-and-coming for driverless cars, the impact that we have made on our environment will hopefully be reduced. Driverless cars are going to be the new kings of the road.  ",0
1169,"Brock was walking in the woods along the creek. At the edge of the water, he saw something that made a body type figure. Brock went down to see if it was a body, but when he got down there, it was really hard to see if it was a body because of the running water. He went back UI to where he saw the body, and he could see it clearly again. He took an picture of the body figure and sent it to the Elkhart County Lab. They went to take a look at it and they hosted the picture sent from Brock online. Most of the people who saw it, including some scientist, thought it was some sort of alien figure. They dug it out and found it to be a rock formed into a body shape by the shadows of the water, and the erosion that has been done to the rock. I believe that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because it isn't an alien formation, you can see what it is made of, and there are other landforms that may look real, but it isn't real.

One example that proves my claim is that the author explains in the excerpt that it isn't an alien formation. The author states that Micheal Main and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snailed an picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. This photo revealed that it was just a natural landform, not an alien monument. The author also states that it has unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Another example that demonstrates my claim is that according to the author, you can see what it is made of. The author shows that the huge rock formation, which resembles a human head, is formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. The author also states that Gavin said, ""as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like, airlines on the ground, or Egytianstyle pyramids, or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

A final example that proves my claim is that the author demonstrates that there are other landforms that may look real, but it isn't real. The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before, and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Gavin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to beer through wispy clouds to see the face and earlier alien markings were hidden by haze. Also, NASA can be hiding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.

Now I hoped I gave you enough information to convince you that the Face is just a natural landform, and not created by aliens.",0

Hello, I have notice you are thinking about requiring all students to perform community service. Some might agree with you because oar community needs to be taking care of. On the other hand, others might degree because they believe community service takes too Mach time away from what they need or want to do. I would like to tell you why I believe that you should be required to perform community service.

Some agree that the community service is needed because we need to take care of oar community.

It is very important to take care of the community. If we don't then oar community would have litter all over the ground, elementary children need help and if we are not willing to help them then not good grades would be on their report cards. We don't have a lot of people helping in oar community services, so we need more helpers bat the people we do have doesn't regret helping oat and serving their job.

Other students however, believes that community service takes too Mach time away from things they want and need to do. Now a lot of students play sports and homework etc. bat maybe on days that they don't have anything to do, or they have extra time they can service the community. Only if it is only an hear at the soap kitchen, I'm are they wouldn't mind helping oat even if it isn't a lot of time.

I believe that students should be required to perform community service because we need to clean App on community and help oat. It doesn't matter if it is last an hear or if it is five hours, students need to learn to help oat with the surroundings around As. I strongly believe that students need to be required because they will see the fan and great feeling of taking care of the community.

Thank you for taking year time and reading this letter. I hope you Understand my thoughts about year decision.

Take care, fellow students.",0
1173,"Requiring students a summer project to extend their academic progression is extremely intelligent, however should the summer project be teacher- designed or student- designed. For me this is simple, letting students design their project would give them control of their summer the way they desire, could become an amazing social experience, and give a chance to show their creativity.

To begin with, the summer is basically one of the only times student get a break from school and no student wants to have to work during it, but allowing them to design their own project gives them the opportunity to work out how and what their going to do and can provide them a much more manageable schedule. Allowing them to fit in any other activities they wanted to indulged in that summer. Such as, summer camps, road trips, internships, etc. Then both parties are happy and fulfilled with what happened that summer.

Secondly, depending on how the students go about the design of their project it could become an extremely fun social experience. Especially when interacting with peers on what topic their going to do, coming together to making groups and working on the project over break, showing each other designs, and giving opinions on each others topics. This could become very fun and memorable experience for these young adults and impact them for the rest of their lives.

furthermore, as educational as school is it lacks one major and crucial thing, creativity. schools can be extremely bad when it comes to providing a platform to express yourself on, but giving students the ability to design their own project can incorporate their style in whatever way they choose. Instead of force feeding them a topic they have no interested in, inevitably causing reluctant behavior towards the project. Being in tune with your creative side creates a entrepreneurs mindset, allowing you to think outside box getting you away from common thinking.

In Conclusion, allowing students to design their own project can come with many benefits. Providing them the freedom needed to enjoy the summer, independent thinking, social skill, and most importantly creativity. And all these life skills from giving the task of one simple project.    ",0

Some of us students have SN outside sport that we trade in for Physical Education, SND go home one period early. Many of us who do these outside activities SRE in accelerated classes SND strive for our best. For example, most of our parents wouldn't let us have SN outside sport if we had BSD grades SND were not trying hard enough in school. If we really wanted to pls your sport, some of us might become homeschooled just to achieve our greatest. But others have the ides of succeeding academic wise. If we were not able to pls your sport anymore, we might not live up to our dress.

Though many of us try hard, others just might not be able to do so well in school, SND we just went to pls your sport because most of our friends SRE there. If students had more time to study without their sport getting in the way, maybe we'd do better in school. For example, many of us might have more time for homework SND studying. But if you crush someone's dress in their sport or activity, then they will never be SS happy SS they used to be. The hope that used to be installed in them every day now may not exist anymore.

Our dress SND hopes can also help us in the future. For example, we can use it when trying to see what our highest expectations for ourselves SRE, SND what we think we can achieve.

Although gt gs impossible to understand how today's actions well affect the future. We can hypothesis that by reducing car usage we can preserve the world by lowering emissions and conserving resources, create stronger communities, and keep cities beautiful.

Today nations around the world are working to create communities that offer an enjoyable life without the use of a car. For example GN Laban, Germany a suburban community has made car use generally forbidden. Gf fact people themselves are pushing for a way to avoid cars. In article one gt was reported that ""57 percent of Laban's families sold a car to move to that community."" One mom reports how she enjoys being able to walk down the streets listening to the sound of children playing(Article 1). In America teenagers are driving later because they don't feel the need to drive. In article four Elisabeth Rosenthal has found that her children would rather find summer jobs that they can access without the use of car. In Bogotá, Columbia the citizen have been enjoying the 118 males of bicycle paths that have been GN place since the mgd1990s. Today they continue to be enthralled with a carless city with the pop-ups of new parts and sport centers. Now citizens can take a stroll and vast restaurants and upscale shopping districts all without the use of the car(Article 3). With the renewal of city centers the old life GN suburbs has become less and less appealing.

Even more importantly reducing drivers would help preserve the world. The idea gs that by limiting the cars on the road emissions can be brought down. Gn response to smog conditions Parts, France took the gntgtgve to issue a partial driving ban. Article 2

Parts bans driving due to smog explains how Parts went about this feat ""On Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine. The same would apply to odd numbered plates the following day."" During that week congestion was down 60 percent. They took this drastic approach because they were nearing the amount of smog GN one of the most polluted city GN the world, Beijing, China. According to article 4 recently GN America researchers have found that the rate of car ownership gs dropping. ""Many sociologists believe that gs this pattern persists gt AGL have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation gs the second-largest source of America's emissions""(Article 4).

One thing gs for certain the current trends gs leading to fewer cars and the creation ODF additional methods of transportation such as Ford and Mercedes who have already started to create a ""broader product range beyond the personal vehicle""(Source 4). Although Ball Ford along with other car companies would suffer from the conversion he surprisingly has been pushing for a world without cars(Article 4). In fact at the mobile world Convention GN 2012""Ball Ford land out a business plan for a world GN which personal vehicle ownership gs impractical or undesirable. He proposed gardening with telecommunications industry to create cities GN which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation office are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emgssgonsand improve safety(Artgcle4). The world gs certainly moving toward a world were car emissions are reduced, life gs more enjoyable, and world city maintain their charm. By involving yourself GN this new type of world you are ensuring that future generations get to experience the same beautiful world that exists today. There are BGG plans for this world John them.

1176,"Presidents, they are the most powerful people in the United States of America. They are the people who make the tough calls for the masses to make sure the benefits of the majority are met because the needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few. Some people think that the way our presidents are elected today are not very practice methods but some people do. Presidents are elected using two processes, those processes are popular vote and Electoral College. The Electoral College is not very practical in my book because they don't spend time in the places that they know they are going to win or not going to and Electoral College is not by majority.

Presidents are like superstars of the political world, but they don't spend any time in the places they are known they will win or lose. Source 2 states ""Candidates don't spend the time in states they know they have no chance of winning."" The candidates for the presidential election don't even try to sway some of the states that either they know aren't going to vote for them or the opponent has already been there and gave them his idea on certain matters. Voters are usually more thoughtful when they don't know who to vote for so the listen to both sides, but there is also the problem of majority in some places and not others.

Majority also plays an impact on the vote of the presidency. Look at how many Electoral College votes California has, they have a total of 55 votes that's more than Wyoming by a landslide because Wyoming only has 3 votes total. If one side got Florida, California, Texas and Massachusetts then the opposing side would have to get all the other states just to catch up. The distribution of the votes is a problem because some states are humongous but they don't have a large population. Some states are really shrimp but have an abundance of people. These are just two reasons why the Electoral College process should be tossed out of the election decisions in general.

Some people say the Electoral College process is just fine because this process avoids run off elections. Source 3 states ""Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives the majority of the votes cast."" They say this because of what happened in the Nixon and Clinton race in 1992. Neither one of them got the majority the both got 43 present of the votes cast. This doesn't help the real problems at hand like the time management and majority issues in the states that have large amounts of people and little land and is versa. The amount of votes each state gets is based on its population and it's not fair to the States that have fewer people just because of there location to suffer while the smaller more populous states don't.

In future election the Electoral College should be taken out of the process in which the president is elected because of the miss use of time and the distribution of population. The popular vote process would eliminate both problems if it was the only process. It would eliminate the time spent in states by making them go to every single one or close to that. They would do this to make sure they got as many votes as possible. It would also eliminate the population aspect because every state would get to make a difference in the election of the president instead of having 3 votes and most of the other states having twice that or more. This election process is to complicated you should dumb it down or simplify it to increase the impact of each state and the simplification for the soon-to-be president. We don't want him to change his mind about doing this important job for us as a country.",0
1177,"Do you think the seagoing cowboys is a good job? Well I do and here are some reasons why. You can spend lots of time with different animals you can also spend a lot of time out on the clear sunny ocean, and most of important of all you are helping people. When you are out on the ocean you can have a lot of fun and join very easily. To think of it I joined just from my friend inviting me to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

Spending a lot of time with different animals on a ship is amazing. You get to feed, take care, and have a lot of fun with them. Taking care of those young cows and mules can be a lot of fun they can sometimes be funny, and they can comfort you. Imagine if there was a awful storm you will always have to cows and mules to keep you company. Wouldn't you love being around lots of animals?

When you get taken overseas to help people it feels good to know you are helping people in need. What if you were those people who needed help to get your countries recovered from a bombing? You would want somebody or someone to help you recover. This is another reason why you should come and join the seagoing cowboys you can be someone who helps people in need of your assistance. This is another reason why you should join us.

Think of being on a cruse except with animals that is what it is like to be over the seas with the seagoing cowboys you can see the sunny clear ocean and there is plenty of fish. You will have a beautiful law of the nice pretty clear ocean. If your lucky enough you can even see the sight of different fish. You can even get the chance to catch them if you wish. There are lots of different things you can do overseas, and we also get to help different countries.

In conclusion, you should join seagoing cowboys because you can have a lot of fun if you enjoy being over sea with a lot of animals see different fish help countries and be the best person you can be. Other things you can do are fencing, bouing, reading,volleyball, and baseball so if you enjoy these activities then you should consider joining the seagoing cowboys. When you are doing those activities it can pass the time if you are missing your family. These are reasons I think you should join the seagoing cowboys.",0

Only five days of banning drivers brought TPE smog rate down 60 percent, that's Huge. To make it easier for TPE people of Paris to get around, they Pad public transit free of charge fort Pose five days. If driving was banned for a while people would find other ways to get around, and other people in TPE community would Help them, like TPE transit bus giving free rides those five days.

Some people may argue that it's a free country and we shouldn't be limited to Pow much we're allowed to drive our cars. Yes it's a free country but limiting car usage is actually getting people to be active, instead of being lazy and driving everywhere you go. TPE United States Pas TPE Highest percentage of obesity. With limiting Pow much you can use your car it will make people walk places, if they really Pave to go somewhere. Also riding a bike, or even riding a bus or train. However, unlike your own car, to get to TPE bus stop or train station, it will take some walking, which is good.

Also, another advantage of limiting car usage would be all TPE things that would be fixed around our community. With people walking more, TPE community and city people would want to make our area look better while we walk. In TPE story ""Carefree day is spinning into a big Pit in Bogotá"" Andrew Silky states, "". Pitted sidewalks Pave been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; new restaurants and upscale shopping districts Pave cropped up."" With less driving and more walking to get to places, TPE community would fix our sidewalks and make more shopping centers and restaurants closer.

Limiting car usage will be Part to adjust to at first, but It Pink in TPE long run it's a win win. It Helps us get active and lower our stress from driving, and it Helps our environment.",0
1179,"Limitation to car usage has had great benefits. People will have better safety, and people are happier and less tense without the usage of a car. Life with no cars are spreading to places such as, Germany, and Bogotá. People will tell you how great their lives been without the usage of a car.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'I Such happier this way."" Said Hadron Walter Other of 2, who lives in the Vauban's community. The Vauban community in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe. Bogotá, Colombia have limited their car usage as well. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car freeway they have in Bogotá. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode his bike to work. They've even had people come to watch the event. Like the Mayor of Paraguay who said, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.""

""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a longer cultural ship,"" said Mini Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University. Nowadays people don't need to drive somewhere to go Meet people. They just use the internet, and the use of cell phones have increased in communicating with people. With these changes, people who have stopped car computing in the United States, Day find less reason to resume the habit. But in places such as New York, with new bike sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tools reflect these new priorities. ""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.""

In conclusion, life with no cars would be beneficial. You'll be provided with better safety, and won't be as tense and a lot happier than you were before. You'll be able to see what life is really all about. A better life.  ",0

1181,"How challenging it is exploring Venus? Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. Sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. On other planets surface temperatures are was to high the are over 800 degrees which is really bad for human being to be up there. Taking electronics up to those plants would melt them.

In Census the temperature is really high and it most likely human being or anything thing in general could live up there because of how high the temperature is which is 800 degrees. NASA workers are studying Venus but the can't really work on it because anything that lands in Venus will just melt because of how hot it is up there. Nobody has gone up there in three decades. Earth is sometimes closer to mar and sometimes closer to Census depending on how fast the are going. NASA is working on something to last longer up there instead of melting so the can get more information on wits going up their instead of sending people out there and during just to get information back.

The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we are used to on our planet.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. The most challenging part is that the clouds of high corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere.

I strongly believe that the shouldn't really be worried about Venus because we already know a little about it and we already know we are not going to be able to grow stuff up their or be able to live up their, so NASA shouldn't be focus in that. So how challenging is it to explore census?",0
1182,"Dear Principal,

I think it would be an Food idea to let students bring their phones to school but only let them use their cell phones at lunch and other free periods. This is an Food idea for many reasons including they can check with parents about the rest of the day, they can write down in their phones what assignments they have and notes about it.

If students where allowed to have cell phones in school they would be able to check with their parents about their after school schedule. For example say the student has a younger sibling they need to pick up but their parent forgot to tell them then if the student had a phone they could learn about the task and know they had to do it. That is just one reason why it is an Food idea for students to be allowed to have cell phones in school.

Also, if a student forgets thing easily they can write down an assignment on their phones to remember it after school. This can help raise students grades and therefore oi vino the student more self-esteem and more chances to succeed in life. Would you deny a student their future?

Some people might say that students would use their phones in class and that would distract them from learning. But this is a simple problem to fix. You could make a rule saying that if anyone is caught using their phones in class that they get a detention. And if a teacher can spot someone chewing out then they can spot someone on a phone.

So as you can see letting students have phones during school but only letting them use it during free periods is an great idea. It is an great idea because parents could inform student about their after school schedule and students could write down assignments after class on their phones. And if this turns out to be a bad idea you could always take away the rule.",0
1183,"Dear Principal,

If you change the policy, so the students don't get to participate kn sports or other activities the students well have a reason for not going to school. School ks a place for social and enhanced learning. Kids get to have friends kn school and with the sport activities kt makes kt easier to get friends. Friends are important for the learning process because friends help each other when they don't understand an assignment kn school.

Student can't find any reason for coming to school kph they don't find kt interesting. They'll think KTS just a waste of time kph they can't have fun. If the students don't go to school then schools well shut down and the mayor well get disappointed. Even though this well get their heads into studying more; other kids won't care. When the children who do work hard see that their friends don't care, they'll gave up.

Students like having activities after doing hard work. Some kids try their best to succeed but the passing grade ks just to high for them to reach. You shouldn't blame them for not having the ability to make progress by taking sports and other activities away. Some children can't even find help at home either because their parent don't speak English or their parent don't care whether their son/daughter get to be someone when they grow up. It's not their fault they have no reason to do better kn school when they think the people around them don't care. You should think twice about taking things away from the innocent.

1184,"Personally, I've always enjoyed participating in clubs. Which is why I believe that if the principal were to decide that everyone had to be in a club, I wouldn't be opposed. I think that having students participate in extracurricular activities is good because they can improve teamwork and relationships, they are something colleges look for, and they can help relieve the stress of school.

First off, they can help with relationships and teamwork. Going an extracurricular where you frequently work with others can help to improve social skills and teamwork strategies. This will definitely help you in your older years, especially if you're going into a field where you need to be able to communicate with people. Communication and collaboration are things I've gotten much better at since I started joining clubs. You can also meet and connect with new people. I've met some of my closest friends in clubs.

Secondly, they're something that colleges look for. Colleges tend to seek people with some experience, and clubs can help you gain that. Picking clubs that lean more towards the major you want in college can be helpful. Certain extracurricular activities are more desired than others, but any clubs will help your application look more desirable. The National (Junior) Honor Society is an example of a club that lots of people apply to because it looks nice on applications.

Lastly, clubs can help relieve the stress of school. School can be incredibly exhausting at times. That's why some people sign up for after school activities. They can be an escape from day today life. These activities let us do something we enjoy that we might not be able to do during school. On days when the clubs I am in meet, I look forward to it the entire day. I have had friends say similar things, such as ""I can't wait for rehearsal!"" or ""Track is something I'm really looking forward to this year!""

If one day the intercom were to turn on and our principal would say ""Every student is expected to join one of our extracurricular activities,"" I wouldn't be upset. I believe that this is a decent idea because clubs can improve relationships and teamwork, they are something colleges look for, and they can relieve the stress of school.",0
1185,"Some students need alternatives for learning and schools should be cable to provide them. Whether it's an Class or just school in general, students should have options based on whichever way they cairn the best. Some students just want to take online so they Ian use their resources which doing their work, others like it because it's the environment they are able to cairn in the most efficiency in. In my opinion, it doesn't matter what reason they have to take the Class. Account that matters is the student is getting a better grade and learning more than the environment he or she was in. Of Course they're people who need to be in a different environment because of median or mental reasons; But this doesn't mean we shouldn't provide it for those who are struggling in an Classroom environment.

Honesty I find this prompt ironic because this year is the first time I've taken an online Class and I've been asked, ""isn't that for kids with special needs?"" , and I find myself saying exactly what I wrote in the first paragraph! Since I am taking an online Class I Ian safety say that it has helped me. The reason I took my Class online (History) is because the Classroom I was in was very Haiti. I am in honors and that is one of the only honors Cases I am taking, so I didn't want the reason for me dropping out of honors to be my teacher/Class, and that's when I thought about online Class. Instead of dropping the Class I was able to stick take honors online and my grade went from a C to an A. On top of that, I have more fun being in this Class, so it makes me wanna cairn. I truck believe that I Ian cairn more in a week of online Class than I would a year of History with Generic_Name. It's not that he's a bad teacher, one again, it's just that environment isn't for me.

I believe that schools should feet obligated to provide an alternative for student's education. In my opinion, the evidence speaks for itself. Would you rather spend a year wasting your time in an Class that you might fair because it isn't the way you cairn, or would you rather spend 8 months in an Class that you'cc have fun in and retain the information for the rest of your life? Duh, the one you'cc do bad in.(sarcasm) Schools already provide alternatives for a cot of kids, but mostly for people who need it (median reasons). But that doesn't mean the students who are struggling in ordinary environments don't ""need"" it too.

1186,"The Face of Mars has proven to be one of NASA's most mystifying cases to ever be solved. Twenty-five years ago, as NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars, it snapped a photo of a startling image resembling a human face. After releasing the image to the public, many people became fascinated in the ""face"". This rolled the ball for many people to believe there was an ancient civilization on Mars. However, modern technology and expertise of numerous scientists have discovered the face is merely a natural landform. The use of more efficient cameras have diminished any hopes of alien life on Mars.

NASA's Mars Exploration Program has already identified the area on which the face is found as Colonia. When the face was first seen in the Jet Propulsion Lab, scientists figured it was a Martian mesa, which were common enough in Colonia. Although it was abnormally figured in the shape of a human face, scientists already knew mesas were prominent in the area of Colonia. Also, modern technology, such as a Mars Global surveyor camera, has revealed the fact that the Face on Mars is nothing but a natural landform. The camera's absolute maximum resolution picture ensures that no ""alien markings"" were hidden by haze, as some skeptics argued. Tn the 2001 image, each pixel spans 1.56 meters, whereas pixels in the 1976 image spanned 43 meters. Therefore, the better camera quality ensures the truth behind the Face on Mars: a natural landform.

Some people argue that, due to the cloudiness on the planet, alien life could have been hidden by haze. However, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor on ""a cloudless summer day in Colonia"" and captured another photo. Gavin explained ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" Gavin knew if there were any pyramids or shacks, the camera would have been able to capture it, and he would have been able to see it. Thus, there is no chance haze could have hidden the aliens. People also argued that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence NASA would rather hide. This is not the case. Authors thought this would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. Therefore, the belief of life on Mars is simply just for the public. TT has been in Hollywood films, books, magazines, and radio talk shows. The Face on Mars was used to engage the public, not necessary to inform.

Proven from better camera quality and scientific knowledge, people can now believe the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. TF any civilization was there, the Mars Global Surveyor would have been able to seen it. Also, mesas are common in the Colonia area, where the face was found. Tn conclusion, better technology from 1976 proves the Face on Mars is a land from, and there is no chance any life on Mars exists based on the face.",0
1187,"I think that driverless cars is something that can potentially make driving a little more safe. Driverless cars are not completely driverless though because they alert the driver when they are needed to take over. Sensors used in cars are also beneficial because they can give information that can cause the car to apply brakes and reduce power from the engine. Therefore, it allows for a better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.

Even though driverless cars can do some things on their own, the human driver must still remain alert and be ready to take over when necessary. For this reason, it is necessary for the car to be ready to notify the driver when a problem occurs. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object, and the Google car announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. These are both ways that can alert a driver when it is time for them to drive, which can help people to be ready to focus while driving.

In conclusion, driverless cars can be beneficial to us and help drivers while they are driving. The drivers of these cars must also be alert as well too. There are sensors and other developments that can help with this process and notify drivers when it is time for them to take control. Everything will not happen right away because it is a process that will take time to be sought through and manufactured correctly. So in the future, maybe we will see more driverless cars than than now, and it will be a beneficial way to the driving in our country.",0
1188,"It is true that there will be a lot of benefits of having driverless cars in the future, utilizing this invention could mean less human error on the roads, having those cars to be used as public transportation could be really convenient since everyone will have access to a form of transportation especially those who do not have a car to begin with, but driverless cars might be too reliable. Although this is all well and good, there are challenges and hurdles driverless cars will have in the community, safety will still be a concern to some people.

If by any chance driverless cars are widely used and completely implanted to our civilization, new laws will be made involving the safety of people when in a driverless car and everyone completely abandoned the concept of driving manually.

Now what if everything else fails and one day the driverless cars stopped working, no one will be able to get to their own destinations with ease, you will also never know when these machines will malfunction since they are completely automatic in terms of driving. Unless the issues are solved and driverless cars are safe and reliable enough, it should not be used by the community yet.

This technology is still new to us and people just started working on driverless cars. We as people should be a bit forgiving, and it is okay to give negative opinions about it. It just means those are the things they need to fit, and it could help them improve driverless cars. I agree that a driver should be given an option for drivers to drive and use autopilot by simply giving us a feature of turning it on and off. I still do not have a good feeling of relying on to machines completely, machines might be rarely making mistakes, but they are far too unpredictable unlike having humans behind the wheel, which again, one of the reasons people have a concern about and requested laws and regulations from the government. In conclusion, technology is great, but it should not be controlling our way of life on a daily basis too more than necessary.",0
1189,"There has been an increase over the past few years of students saying, they hate going to school therefor, the school staff is trying to make school more enjoyable for students. Many students do not look forwards to waking up and having to go to school because, they get bored or don't feel like doing their work. A way to resolve this problem could be making it a requirement to take eXtracurricular classes. Students should be required to participate in eXtracurricular activities so that they can be more involved, given new opportunities, and be more excited to do there work.

One reason that eXtracurricular classes are good for students could be that, the students would be more involved. Students would be forced to work with people. This could help them open up and be more social with people. If the student decides to do a sport as their eXtracurricular class, it would help them be a good teammate. This also would teach them how not to get upset if they lose. That is one reason why I think students should be required to participate in eXtracurricular activities.

My next reason why I think students should be required to do a eXtracurricular class is because, it would give them new opportunities. Students would get to do more activities that they may have never done before. This would give them the chance to do more activities that they enjoy. Student wants a more relaxing activity or class, that they can do. They want a little break in the school day to relax and be stress-free. That's another reason why it should be a required to make students do a eXtracurricular class.

For my final reason why I think students should be required to do eXtracurricular activities is because, it would make students more exited to go to school and do their work. Students should have something to look forwards to doing. No student enjoys knowing that they have to wake up and do the same boring thing every day. They should be excited to go, and see what they are going to be doing for that day. That's my final reason why I think that students should be required to do a eXtracurricular activity.

Making students do this activity would most likely make their grades go up. This would make them want to learn and do well. I think that students should be required to do a eXtracurricular class or activity because, it would make students more involved, it would give them more opportunities, and it would make them more exited about going to school. ",0

While I normally don't have any Complaints, and being the person I am not many things ""bug me"", but I recently found that I disagree with a Certain argument. And while it is near voting times, I believed it's best for me to send you my side on this Continuous debate to Change your mind on the matter. The electoral College has had its share of arguments and I would like to make my side seen knowing I have quite a bit of logical arguments. Please read with an open mind.

The electoral College is unfair in many ways, this one however San be seen as minor. The electoral College gives an easier way to get tie, and although a tie hasn't been a main focus, it is San prove to be a problem. I read an article stating that if a tie were to happen the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. This would anger a heap of people for many reasons, one stating it would almost rule out their vote.

Secondly, the electoral College simply takes away from voting in general. An example of this is lets say Obama won popular vote, he should win because that's what America wants right? No, because what if another president won electoral vote? That president would win and take away the point in voting. This is unfair because we the people would like to have a better say in whom becomes our president.

In the article I read, it stated ""At the most basis level, the electoral College is unfair to voters. Unfair, outdated, irrational"" I agree Completely. How is it irrational? Well simply because it is just an extra step added on. In all reality our Country would be fine without it. Popular vote is exactly what we need, and that alone is enough. And while I do believe it's good to go an extra step, it shouldn't go when not needed. This to me is most important because I Would argue all day long and in the end this would be my argument.

Thank you for your time, and please take this into Consideration, I realize that it has its upsides, but it is just unfair, outdated, and irrational. And please noise the other downsides as well, while I did not have the time or room to include them.

1193,"For most people it is more common to get from place to place by hopping in a car. Fut, what if we never used cars, or at least limited them? Lives would be impacted in a very positive way. In

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, by Elisabeth Rosenthal,

Paris bans driving due to smog, by Robert Duffer,

Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Sonata, by Andrew Silky, and

The End of Car Culture, by Elisabeth Rosenthal the authors show how cars are not a necessity to life and how our communities can even be better off without them. Because of the positive impact on our environment and the increase of a community, limiting car usage is a serious idea worth of a second look.

Cars, especially in America, are a major source of transportation. Without them many people would not have an easy way to commute to where they need to be. Fut, convince is causing more pain than pleasure and starting to harm our environment. Cars just by themselves cause around fifty percent of the greenhouse gases that are emitted into the atmosphere. Similarly, they cause twelve percent in Europe (par. 5) Logically it would make sense to find the root of a problem and change it to make the problem go away, but in the case of cars, cars are a root in the pollution problem, but many people need them to GE to get where they need to be. The easiest solution to this is to limit our car use and add more busses and easier, more aces sable areas for bikes and walking. Pollution will lower and people will still get to where they need to be. Pollution is a major topic regarding the safety of our environment and cars have been a proven source of much of the pollution in the air. Using fewer cars consider with less pollution in our surroundings. Paris, France was suffering from very high pollution in the air. To combat this, for five days certain people, based on their license plate number, were not allowed to use their cars. Though not everyone complied, after the five days the smog went from the levels found in the worst city for pollution, Facing China, down by sixty percent (par.14). In just under a week Paris went from being the most polluted it had ever been to a better, safer level. If a city just by limiting the car usage by half was able to make such a drastic difference in that time, imagine it being limited more over a wider area. There is a possibility of totally correcting the pollution problem worldwide, or at least making it better and more easily handled. Although the environment is important, cars are also affecting the way we interact as people in a community.

Because we have cars, we never really see the scenery around us. We exit our houses, jump in our cars, drive, and walk Ito our destination. There is no contact with nature or other people passing by. Limiting cars can lead to the increase of interaction and better looking cities. In Bogota, there is a day once a year called ""carefree day"", in which no one is allowed any use of their personal cars and fined if they do not comply. Because of this there has been an increase in new high end restaurants and places to shop. The community has also added more city parks and places for sports. There is no traffic rush hour and due to the increased walking the old broken sidewalks have been replaced with larger new ones (par.28). No one wants to not only have to walk, but have to walk on a surface that is hard to walk on and unappealing. Due to this, people started to create parks and sports centers for a nice place to be as well as a nice place to look at. And because of the increased foot traffic, there have been more people opening shops and restaurants, as no one speeding by in a car will notice a small corner store, but someone strolls by, taking in the scenery will. In response to the increased foot traffic, it is important that there is somewhere to actually put your foot, and old cracked pavement won't cut it. If there are fewer cars, less road pavement is needed and more sidewalk pavement is. So, the old pavement is replaced with more pavement that is in better shape. All the walking and passing people causes people to be more social and to interact more often. The members of a community are more together. Mr. Siva, a researcher, had noticed both of his children are not interested in getting a driver's license. Everything they do is centered around walking, public transport, and carpooling. They don't find it necessary to have a car and license (par. 39). The children of the researcher don't have or need a car because what they do doesn't require them to have one. They get a more full experience not being in a car all the time. In a carpool they get to socialize with friends and while walking they get an outdoor and community experience.

In short, cars are an easy way to get from area to area, but they are very harmful to the environment and our community. They add pollution to the air and cut off our everyday contact. If we limited the use of cars we would lower pollution, cause our cities to be more attractive, have better ways of transport, and be closer as people in an area. So, is a car still going to be your most common way of transport? Think of the good you would do to the world if it wasn't.",0
1194,"Researchers say, if people take a few month breaks from something, they will most likely forget it and will have to relearn it. Some schools require students to complete projects over the summer. People debate on whether the project should be teacher designed or student designed. Summer projects should be student designed because it would allow the student to be more creative, do a project they would enjoy, and gives students more independence.

If students were to be required to make a summer project, and it was student designed, it would let students be more creative. Most teachers and parents want their student/child to think outside the box. A student led project would make students use their brain more, during their 2-month-long break of not doing anything. The project would allow students to develop an independent mind. They would give a nudge for students to get out of their comfort zone. The project would make students think more independently at a younger age. As they get older, they will be more inclined to do things out of their comfort zone. Supporting a student to lead his summer project would make the next generation more creative.

A student led summer project would allow students to pick a topic they would enjoy. Majority of people will produce quality work if they have a passion for it. People like to work on projects they enjoy and can open their minds to. If someone likes a subject they will most likely want to pursue that subject. Some students will find the topics a teacher gives them boring and motivating. This is due to the fact that one person cannot satisfy everyone in the room. If a student doesn't like a topic they will not enjoy it, and it will not accurately represent their academic skills. Allowing students to lead their own summer projects, means they will pick something they will enjoy and have a passion for.

Doing a student led summer project would give students more independence. Students would have to take more responsibility. If a student were to do bad on a project they would have to take responsibility for their actions. It would train the next generation to take responsibility instead of blaming someone else. This would give students more preparation for the adult life. They school system gives little to no preparation on how to manage an adult life, but it would give students a little more experience for the students. A project like this would give people a little nudge to grow up gradually. Summer projects would give more independence, if it was student led.

Student led summer projects would, overall, allow students to be more creative, do something they enjoy, and give students more independence.

Summer projects should be student designed, so they can continue learning over the summer break.",0
1195,"I would keep the Electoral College because it consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and Vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. If people want to change the election for popular votes is basically your generally chosen by the candidates political party...and what their responsibilities are. My response to that not everybody is chosen by political party.

Now, if people want to change the election by popular voting is held every for years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your states electors when you vote for presidents because when you vote for your candidates you are actually voting for your candidates electors. My response to that is.sometimes presidents want to be president because ""they want to change everything in the United States like .taxes.and health insurance. For example like Obama care he has change the health insurance and people don't like that. And 2016 there's going to be a new President in the United States.  ",0
1196,"Dear state senator,

I think that every person who wants to go for president should go to electoral school, just so when every Tue person runs for president they don't win because they are well known and popular vs Tue other person who is not well known. Also, if they do go to election school they could learn now to run for president and learn now to write speeches, and also teach them that some of Tue 50 states in Tue United States uave to have UIs/UER vote.

Tue outcome of a person running for president that went to electoral school their electoral vote will be above average for one year and if they do good as president then Tue outcome for next year will maybe bet figure or lower. Iuen ever a US citizen votes they are also voting for Tue electors candidates. And when you do vote that person who is running for president that helps UIs/UER's group get elected. Every president UAS to have a Vice president.",0
1197,"""When in dought ask for help."" We all have different opinions and sometimes we want to know what others think about it. I think asking more than one person for there thoughts or opinions can be very helpful because, sometimes I dont know what to choose and when I ask my friends if they can help me choose between something because I cant, they all choose different things with there own opinions and explanations. Sometimes if Im not sure with what I am doing I ask my friends or family members for there opinions. Some of my friends and family members think its okay and the rest dont.

Choosing something for me can be difficult at times. I like to ask my friends on what they think or what there opinions are. I once was not sure on what shoes to buy at the time. I could of either bought Nike or Vans. It was really hard because I wanted both but at the time I could only get one. So I asked my friends on what shoes they like the most and why. One of my friends told me I should get Vans because they were pretty. My other friends told me I should get the Nike because they make you taller and there more comfortable. And I agreed with them so I ended up getting Nike. My mom and I love to go shopping. One time I was only allowed to get one item from the store. I really wanted to get two shirts but I couldnt. I sent my friends a picture and asked them ""which one do you think is prettier?"" They all choose the same shirt so I told my mom I was going to get that one, but my mom liked the other one because it covered up more. I explained to her that for me it wouldnt show as much. And I got the the shirt. My parents are very adventurous they love going places. This summer that is coming up I can either go to Guatemala for two weeks or I can go to Florida for two weeks. I have already been to those places and I really like them both. There both really pretty places. I asked my friends what they they would choose. Half of them told me I should go to Guatemala so I can see some of my family. the other half said there would be less money spent if I went to Florida. It was a very hard decision but they convinced me in going to Guatemala so I can see some of my family.

We have all had a time where we didnt know if we should or shouldnt do something. And when thats happens to me I always ask my friends or family members what they think. Last fall me and my best friend went to

Generic_Name for the Halloween fest. I got really scared at night, we were going to go into a haunted house but I wasnt sure if still wanted to go. I was scared when I told my friend that I wasnt sure if I still wanted to do that. She told me, ""Well you dont have to but just remember we already payed for this and we are doing it together."" I decided to ask my brother what he thinks he told me ""Its okay I dont care anyway"" I knew my friend was right so I went in the haunted house with her holding on as hard as I could because I was really scared. At the end of the day I was glad I told her because I had a blast that night. One time I was invited to a party my mom said I could go but I had to be safe. I wasnt sure if i should go because I knew the people at that party did stuff they shouldnt. I thought of it the whole week and I decided to ask my friend what she thought about sh said ""if you want to go you can go I dont care."" I still wasnt sure with that so I asked my other friend and she told me ""I dont think you should go to the party if you know whats going to happen. Your my best friend and I know you can decide too but I think its better if you dont go and you stay home where its safe."" After she told me that I knew for sure I wasnt going to the party. This year someone I liked asked me out. My friends were telling me that I should say yes. That day I decided to tell my mom. She told me ""I dont think its a good idea for you to start dating right know, I dont want that getting in the way of your studies you are still very young and you will find someone if the future."" I decided to take her advice and say no. My friends were upset with me that I didnt say yes. I didnt really care because I knew it was the right decision for me.

I think asking more than one person for there opinions is a good idea because, sometimes I dont know what to choose and I ask my friends if they can help me choose. Other times if Im not sure if Im doing the right thing

I ask my friends or family members for there opinions. Asking more than one person may or may not help some people but thats okay. We all have our own ways.",0
1198,"JT's come to my attention that more and more people every day seem to believe that the Face is created by aliens. Unfortunately, as cool as it would be, it was not. The face is simply just a natural landform with shadows casting down on it making it look as if it has a face. Everyone has just been seeing this information in magazines and on T.V. and believing it is true, but they never seem to believe the truth that it is not a Face created by aliens. This is common for this planet to create natural landforms as well.

Most people just believe it is created by aliens because they hear information from their friends, or they see it on T.V. or see it in magazines. The truth is most of these things do not even have enough evidence to prove what they are saying. They just believe it is true because it is interesting. They do not even have the proof that aliens exist, and as cool as it may seem, it is just not true. J know some people will come to their senses and realize what they are saying when they say that they believe aliens exist and people just look at them like they are stupid.

We have no other evidence as well that aliens exist, which means we pretty much have to believe that it is a natural land from, which it is. J know most people will stick to their belief that aliens are real and that they created the Face, but they are not real, and they didn't. J know J may make some people upset by stating the facts but JM just telling the truth. Having no other evidence leads us to believe it is just a normal natural landform with shadows. J do not blame those of you that believe it was created by aliens, it sounds cool right? But JM sorry to be the bear of bad news, but it is also the truth.

These landforms are common on this planet as well.

JT is not unusual for these landforms to occur. JT is just the certain shape that sees to have bought everyone's attention. The shape itself is not what created the Face but in fact it was just the shadows that made it look as if it had, had the shape and form of a face as we humans have. This natural landform is known as a mesa, which you may have heard of before. The point is, these types of things happening on this planet is very common.

J believe myself that it is just a natural landform because J know that we do not have enough evidence to prove that it was anything else. J also believe it is just a natural landform/mesa because J know these things are common on this planet. So don't just go around telling people aliens exist before you get the actual facts. Of there were further evidence leading to make us believe there were aliens it would be fine. We just don't have that extra information or evidence. J hope J finally lead some of you to believe the truth that the Face is just a natural landform.",0

This isn't just ANR true of cowboy program, this is a cowboy who rode the waves. I think it would be good for kids to come help out at this program. It can make You smart and learn about things You might not know.

This for named Luke went with his best friend. His life totally changed. I'm now going to tell You who You should come. What the did there was the helped people. The for born placed fun games like, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling. The did that to help pass time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much of an adventure. Now here are some places the went that I think You might like. It took the group two weeks to travel across the Atlantic ocean. The went to China which took a month. Also, the program went to Greece to get their Military service. For World War ll in 1945, the went to Europe.

Now I'm going to tell You things the did to help out that You might like to do, if You like to do chores. Luke served as a night watchman. Also, he went and checked on the animals every hour. Also, to keep Luke bus about the animals is the had to be fed or watered two or three times a DAR. Another thing is bales of heir and bag of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. The stalls also had to be cleaned.

Lastly I'm going to tell You who Luke went on this ship and who You might want to. Luke went on this trip because he wanted to help out is best friend. Also, he knew it was possible the only chance he would ever get to go. Another reason is Luke thought it might be good work him. I think he also went on this trip to help out 44 other countries to recover their items. This was a very important job and Luke did a good job. I bet if You tried this, You would too.

Do You think You would ever want to go on this trip? I would, it sounds like You have to do work, but You still can have a lot of fun with the trip. I think it is also important to help out with other things. Maybe some DAR You should try this some DAR if You ever get the opportunity.",0
1200,"Ix this article ""Unmasking the Face ox Mars."" it is about a rock formation from the Red Planet that many people believe was created by aliens, but it was not created by aliens. Three reasons are first NASA has little evidence that it was not created by aliens, second this shadowed human face is just a rock formation, AXD third the pictures take revealed it wasxt from aliens.

First, NASA has little evidence that it was not created by aliens Ix the article NASA says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martial equivalent of a butte or mesalaxdforms common around the American West."" NASA does have much more evidence to that they wort reveal. Ix paragraph five it talked about how NASA was hiding there evidence. Also, few scientist from NASA believed the Face was ax alien artifact for a while too, until they did more investigation AXD found it wasxt.

Second, this shadowed human face is just a rock formation. Ix the article it says ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation. . . Which resembles a human head. . . Formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, rose, AXD mouth. At first scientist figured it was another Martial mesa, but the they found out it was't which I'm sure they're glad it was something else because Martial mesa are something common. Ix paragraph twelve they give descriptions AXD compare the rock formation to earth like things. One thing it said was ""it reminds me most of Middle Butte ix the Sake River Plain of Idaho,  says Garcia. that a lava dome that takes the form of ax isolated mesa about the same height as the Face ox Mars.

Third, the pictures take revealed it wasxt from aliens. A quote from the article is ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared ox a JPL website, revealing. . . A natural landform. There was to alien monument after all."" The pictures they had take were high enough quality to prove it was just that rock formation. A quote from the article to support this is ""Each pixel ix the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel ix the best 1976 Viking photo."" They had a camera that was TeX times sharper that the Viking photos that were take AXD could see through the clouds AXD the camera could spot almost anything like weird unusual shapes, markings, AXD skeptics. Ix the article it said 'The camera ox board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.

This article is about a rock formation from the Red Planet that many people believe was created by aliens, but it was not created by aliens. There were three reasons to support my answer they were first NASA has little evidence that it was not created by aliens, second this shadowed human face is just a rock formation, AXD third the pictures take revealed it wasxt from aliens. After you read this essay you should be convinced it was just a rock formation because there is so much evidence from NASA proving it is.",0
1201,"So the face on Mars. Many people SAU the face is an alien landmark. Well I don't. I'm going to explain to you who it isn't. Also, that it is just a natural made landform.

What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American west. "" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River plain of Idaho,"" SAU Gavin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars.

So on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia for the first time, Michael Main and his Mars orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a GPL website, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

A few DAUs later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a"" huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth"" This is a great explanation for the was the face looks.

So there you have it. I SAU that the face is just a natural made landform. There is no evidence to show otherwise. With the better camera we were able to find out that it's not an alien artifact. So UES it is not an alien artifact.",0
1202,"How do you feel About students summer being teacher designed or student designed? I Agree this student projects should be designed by themselves. Students will be Able to hive their own creative project either thin, hiving the some thing Is their friends. Students wouldn't think this other people Ire cheating from their projects.

In my opinion, I Agree this students summer projects should be student designed.

Firstly, Students summer projects should be based on students designed because of the creativity of students.

In this generation students hive I lot of creative ideas Ind this It in be use in there classwork. Students doing projects this Ire student designed will give students to think About whit they will do instead of being outside Ind doing the wrong thing. For example, Generic_Time his I project this he his to-do over the summer but, his teacher says this It his to be In her order Ind this it his to be plain. When Generic_Time gets home he decided to go outside with his friends. Since Generic_Time cannot be creative on his project he will not start on It.

Next, I think students wouldn't protect there project from other students Anymore If they hive to do their own creative project. It Is more thin 45% of students chest In the U.S. today, students will hive more trust in their peers Around them If they be Able to use their creative mind. For instance, Generic_Time Ind Generic_Time Ire doing there projects but Generic_Time walks out to use the bathroom, Generic_Time meanwhile gets up Ind time pictures of Generic_Time project because, he forgot how there teacher told them how to do It. Since Generic_Time forgot how to do the project he hid to chest.

Furthermore, I Agree this students summer projects should be students designed but, If the project the teacher gives out Is by there designed It in help In many different ways. Teachers will be Able to hive lesser work while checking these projects If they Ire by their own designed. Teachers will be Able to grade In I short Amount of time because If the student follows the directions, the teacher wouldn't hive to be frustrated on the grade.

Finally, students should be Able to designed there projects either thin hiving your teacher deciding whit to do.  ",0
1203,"To me, having an extracurricular activity ix a very important thing that I do because I have something to look forward to after having a stressful day of school. Instead of going home and doing homework, I can socialize with my friend and top worrying about other things going on. I think if everyone in the school got that opportunity, students would be more social and be able to make new friend.

Playing sports had always been a big thing in my family because sports will keep you active and out of the house and the last thing my parents want to see ix UX hitting on the couch doing nothing, but having an activity will keep you busy. Ax the year AXX, more and more children are becoming overweight, and sports provide daily exercise to prevent childhood obesity and possibly encourage better eating habit. Most sports are one team working together to achieve a common goal. This can teach young athletes teamwork and social kill that they will carry with them for the next of their live.

When I am really treated out about something, I will usually put my headphones on listen to some music or go outside and play basketball or lacrosse. Doing something you enjoy will usually calm you down and relieve street. Interschool activities can really help if you are usually treated about something. If sports aren't your thing, there are plenty of other activities you can do like club and social group. Joining a social group will help you make new friend and find people that relate to you. Bullying ix a serious thing, and something that could reduce or prevent it ix a social group. Having people interact with each other will create bond and reduce bullying.

So if all students had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, I think it would benefit the school and the community. This would provide exercise to one who join a sports team, teach teamwork and social kill, decrease street, help students socialize, and prevent bullying.  ",0

If you look upset oi worried it would be easy detect and when someone Realize they while try communicating with you. Having to hide emotions and not communicate it is easier to notice in a person.

The software will help Recognize you emotions just by looking at you face. For example, in the article it says ""A classroom computer could Recognize when a student is becoming confused oi bodied"". It will be helpful to the instructor to have more coefficient lessons for the students. The article also tells you ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"".

1206,"Mars has aliens! Many people believe that the landform on Mars was created by aliens, but here at NASA we have found that landform was actually created naturally. The landform is referred to as a Martian mesa, which is common in the region of Colonia, but this has shadows that make it appear as if the figure has a face. Since the discovery of the form, it has been in movies, books, and radio talk shows. Some conspiracy theorists say that the form was actually created by aliens, but why would we want to hide the fact that there is life on Mars when in reality it would benefit here at NASA. The landform is Martian mesa formation much like the Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho.

The Martian mesa is the term used for the landform. It is very common to find them on Mars in the region of Colonia. The Martian mesa was naturally formed, but with its shadows, it looks much like a face. In 1998 Mars Global Surveyor was close enough to actually see if there were any alien monuments and turns out that there wasn't any.

Here at NASA we received a lot of attention when the ""Face"" was discovered. If the landform was actually created by aliens, why would we try to hide it? The landform had no monuments near it when looked at by the Surveyor. ""Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" People wanted there to be something because it would benefit us.

In the end, the landform was found to be a Martian mesa. There are many mesas in the region of Colonia and that's a part of how we found out how it was a natural landform. Also, the Surveyor verified that there wasn't any other monuments near the landform. If there was any life on Mars we would want to tell the people, so they can be interested in the activity at NASA, but for now there has not been found any life activity on Mars.  ",0
1207,"I think by having older students with younger students would be helpful. Because older students can help the younger students with homework, projects and classwork. Older students how to do the right things that can help the younger students.

To begin with, having older students can teach the younger students on what they need help with in school. This can be really helpful to younger students because with help someone that is older than you they can help you improve in school. Like for example my friend is one year older than me and helps me with school work when I need it. Older students can help teachers by help the students with classwork. Having older students in k program can be useful because they can show the younger students how to act the right way in class, knd show others to do what they need to do.

Additionally, younger students can look up to older students that they trust. Because they have helped them in school and having fun spending time with each other. Some younger students might think kn older student can treat them ks k sibling. Like for example I see one of my friends ks k sibling because we have been friends since we were little and I trust them. So it's good to look up to someone that you trust and count on and be their for you when you need them.

Finally, I think having older students and younger students in the some program would be great. Because older students can show the younger students how to be right and do what your teacher tells you what to do. And parents went their kid to do good in school so they can have k good life to live. Having k mix of older and younger students can learn to do things together. By having older students it can effect the younger students to do good in school.

In conclusion, I think it's good to have k mix of older and younger students to be in the some program. This can help older and younger students to work together. And helping one in other is to help improve what they need help on. Like on homework, clksswork, knd projects to see what the need to improve.",0

1209,"Room! Cars have been developing for hundreds of years all over the world. They have become very dangerous to the environment and there are many advantages to limiting the use of them.

There is only so much space on earth and a lot of it is taken up by parking. No matter where you go there will always be parking spots on the fertile ground that we need to preserve. Garages, street parking, and driveways not only house vehicles, but they also take up valuable space! Ky limiting the use of cars we can cut back on the land wasted to house them.

Another important advantage to limiting car use is that it will save you money! Every day, we hear about a new car that just came on the market, but the price only keeps on increasing. No one wants a cheap car that they are embarked to be seen in and many pay vigorously for new upgrades. The biggest expense is gas, which you will have to pay for almost every day as the price keeps rising.

Finally, car usage is awful for the environment. Paris is in days of near record pollution and its become so bad that they had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air. Every time you start your car smog comes out of your exhaust polluting the air. After a while it falls back to the ground and sticks so when it rains the roads become very slick which is a major hazard.

In conclusion, we should all limit the use of cars. Although It's ok to use them in moderation; they are still space consuming, expensive, and bad for the environment.  ",0

Having cars that drive themselves seems like a whole big mess. People these days are getting to lazy to get into a car and drive it yourself. My position on driverless cars are that I am against it. These cars should not be developed for humans.

These driverless cars of the ""future"" are not truly driverless. According to the text, there still has to be a driver in the car to drive it in situations like: pulling in and out of driveways, dealing with complicated traffic issues, and navigating through roadwork or accidents. Even though the car can steer, accelerate, and brake without the driver doing it. The car still needs to keep the human alert of such things like going around accidents or driving through zone work. The future generation of teens will not know how to drive a car properly with these new driverless cars. What kind of person would want a driverless car that still needs the help of a driver? According to Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver, he says"" We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" The manufacturers want to have in-car entertainment. Driving should not be fun, it should have taken more serious and with more caution. This in-car entertainment would be too distracting for the driver. Many new technologies has had malfunctions.

1211,"Good day state senator in this letter I would like to talk to you about changing the Electoral College to a popular vote. Even though the Electoral College is a good way of selecting a president. This meat hot has his flaws, under the electoral college system the people that vote are not voting for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. And I think that the people that vote shade vote directly for the candidate they have chosen.

This makes more sense that voting for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledge to the candidate.

I think at the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters. Since the voter are not voting directly for their candidate of choice, I personal don't think this is the best way to go. The popular elections provide a better way of voting for president. Since it means that the people that vote a voting directly to the candidate and not the electors. The popular elections are a safer a more fair way to vote. By this we could evade the disaster factor, for example the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century and the system allows for much worse.

1212,"The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents because they have tried to explore Venus for many years, and they can't succeed because only they can stay there for a couple of hours before they can't be out on Venus anymore however they do have a nickname for Venus it is called the ""Evening Star"" and why they named it that because it is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky, but they said that nickname was misleading because Venus was an actual planet in our solar system and Venus was simple to see from a distance, but it is a safe vantage point from it said that it was proven a very challenging place to examine more closely but they often referred Venus as earths twin because Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size, and it is occasionally the closest in distance too. But striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity it will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. And our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

1213,"In my opinion, cars are a faster way to get around, but they rely too much on nonrenewable resources to run.  I understand that there are more hybrid cars being made, but that doesn't change the fact that there are still plenty of people out there using diesel.  Even the hybrid cars somewhat rely on gasoline.  I think that the idea of Vauban, Germany was a great idea and a great experiment.  They made a small area that did not rely nearly as much on cars, and they saw how the public reacted.  They realized that more and more people were giving up their cars to live in Vauban just because it was much more peaceful and much less polluted than normal communities.  I think that Vauban, Germany is going to have a big impact on society about how people think about their cars, and it already has.

Paris, France has made a bold attempt to lower car usage in their area.  They have banned cars in general and charged a 22euro fine ($31) to anyone caught driving.  It started out great, congestion was down 60 percent and the smog was dramatically decreasing, but soon companies started to complain about not being able to deliver with trucks which is understandable.  To clear these complaints, Paris added some things to their law.  Exceptions were made for plugin cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers.  Public transit was also free of charge from Friday to Monday to make transportation easier.  By Monday, the smog was already cleared enough to rescind the ban on Tuesday.  Kind of goes to show how much cars take part in pollution.

Bogotá, Columbia has been having a carefree day, ""Day Without Cars"", for three straight years and the people love it!  All the rough sidewalks have been replaced with nice new smooth ones, 118 miles of bicycle paths have been constructed and parks and sports centers have appeared all over the city just for this day.  The Day Without Cars started as an improvement campaign meant to spread to other countries.  The effects of this day have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have been built.  As expected, this day has lowered pollution exponentially and has made the residents of Bogotá much happier than stated by businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza, ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""  In my opinion, there needs to be a day like this where I live!

In conclusion, cars have a fair amount of both pros and cons.  They are a faster way to get around, and they have been a big part of society for quite a long time, but they also cause terrible pollution and emit greenhouse gases.  In this essay I have listed a few different ways people have conducted experiments in attempt to reduce the use of cars and seeing how people react.  They have turned out well but what I am really looking forward to seeing is a major city like goo York taking a stand like this and finding out if people would ever get used to it.

1214,"Saving money is one result of limiting car usage, another result is that limiting your car usage can relieve some of your stress. There are many places that do it today, like Germany, Paris, and Bogotá.

In the first source ""In German Suburb, fife Goes On Without Cars"", it talks about how you aren't tensed up all the time anymore, one person even said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". What he means by ""this way"" is that he is much happier that he doesn't have to worry about a car anymore. In source two, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", it shows that many people are getting fined because they have an even numbered scenes plate, the same applies to the odd numbered scenes plates the following day. This can cause stress if you do not listen to the instruction because you would get a fine of 22euro, or $31. If you listen to the law, you can also save money.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can relieve stress and save you money because you won't have to worry about other people crashing into you, and because you won't always have to buy gas for your vehicle.  ",0
1215,"My fellow citizens, some advantages of limiting car usage is that it's better for the earth and reduces the greenhouse effect.

Also, there won't be as much smog and there will be a lot less pollution in the air.  Limiting the usage of cars can be a better for you. Not using a car can really benefit us.

People use cars every day for everyday things.  If people cut down on the usage of cars and took the bus or even rode a bike to work it really could help the earth.  Fewer cars mean less of the greenhouse effect.  Less of the greenhouse effect means a better world.

Billions of people driving cars can really pollute the earth.  Paris had to ban driving because the smog was too great and needed to be cleared from the sky.  The smog was so serious that if you didn't leave your car at home you would get a fine.  Almost 4,000 people were fined.  Beijing, China is one of the most polluted city in the world because of smog.

If you don't take a car you could walk, bike, or skate witch could be fun.  If not then you could always take the bus and still help of the earth.  If you didn't take a car to work then it could reduce traffic.  Some people enjoy riding a bike instead of a car because it reduces stress and also reduces pollution to the earth.

Limiting car use is not only good for you but also good for the earth its self.  There could be less greenhouse effect and smog.  Let's all help and limit the usage of cars.",0
1216,"Why should cars be limited? There's really no reason why. It's what would happen with or with out them. I see that all cars are is a deadly machine that can kill anyone at anytime. Over a hundred intent people die every month by a car accident or and motorized vi ache collision.

There's some places around the world where cars are limited to residents owning a car. For example: Vauban, Germany. Just because there's to many people that do not own any type of transportation have to walk the streets and so the people that own cars have a hard time trying to get places with all the people crowding the streets. When there's to many people walking it begins to back YP traffic to a point people give YP there cars to actual get to their work on time or to see a movie before it starts. I believe cars should be limited to the point where people have to walk. To CYT down the obesity rate.",0
1217,"Many people believe that owning and using a car or other motorized vehicles is an advantage. But is it really? Citizens might be able to get somewhere faster or not have to exert the energy to get there. But is it worth polluting the air, taking up all that space and creating traffic and frustrated citizens, and creating the mindset of a Mary, human being? Maybe instead of spending money on a car, citizens wouldn't be in as much debt, some Ends might have college already paid for, and some citizens have their housing paid for. Therefor, this is making happier, stress free, citizens.

The pollution of the air is a major argument for people who support the nonusage of cars or other motorized vehicles. In Source 1: In Germany Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal claims that motorized vehicles play a major part in the pollution of the air. Rosenthal says that Europe is responsible 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and the United States is responsible for up to 50 percent.

Most of the time, traffic causes a driver to be frustrated. What causes traffic? Vehicles. So why does everybody drive them? In small, well populated suburbs, traffic is a major issue. With the dense population and the majority of those citizens driving vehicles, traffic is very easily created. Thus, making more citizens frustrated and creating road rage. Road rage also causes more accidents which causes more deaths. Making driving, a dangerous thing. Although, citizens still drive motorized vehicles. Most of the time it is to get to a certain place in a short amount of time, but if a destination is closer than one mile, there is no excuse to use a vehicle to get there. But most citizens do. This creates a Mary mind set.

The average cost of a brand-new car is roughly 30,000. If citizens avoid buying a car, it would be a great benefit for them. 30,000 can pay off college, or help with bills or debt, or payoff housing. With more money, this creates happier, and less stressed citizens.

The creation of ""car dues"", and ""carefree days"" could made a huge difference in the environment, economy, safety, traffic, and even the health and stress of a citizen. Although most people still believe that having a car is an advantage, it can be. But not having a car or not using a car as much is a much greater advantage. Not just to an individual, but to society as a whole.",0
1218,"Dear Principle,

I think the cell phone policy 1 that states ''Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time'' is was you should consider the new policy. This policy is both fair to the students and the teachers. I feel as though why should i have to leave my phone at home, if i can just turn it off during class time. Policy 2 is not fair at all. Students should have some freedom with there cell phones. The biggest concern with the phones being brought to school is that the students will have he phones out in class, and will not being paying the teacher no attention. So they feel to eliminate the problems students should just keep them at home huh? But with policy 1 it makes it so much fair for the teachers and the students. It lets the students bring there phones to school and pay attention in class at the same time.

In the video it demonstrated a lot of students using there phones in the classroom as well as the hallways. I think that in the scene where the video showed the students in class having his\her phone out is where the problem begins. If you had a policy like policy 1 you wouldn't have to worry about it. I understand that the students need discipline also but giving them the policy to have to leave there phones at home is so not fair. Letting the students know that we are giving you the privilege to bring your cell phone to school but you MUST turn them off while your in class time, or teachers have the right to convenscate them. i feel that's fair because if the students follow the rules that the phones must be off they wont have to even worry about there phones getting taking. I don't understand the problem with allowing the students to have there phones out while there at lunch or having free time. For example say if we are having a school activity such as a dance or a basketball game. Everybody doesn't enjoy these types of games\activitys. So maybe they would prefer to just sit down and maybe play a game or something on there phone. Me personality i would rather be on my phone then watch a boring basketball game but that's my opinion.

With policy 2 there are not all problems or cons with that policy. I just think that the students should have a say to. Policy 2 can eliminate a lot of problems such as the following,

-Getting your phone stolen.

-Getting it taking from a teacher for having it out.

-Not pay attention while your in class because your on it.

All of these possible problems can and might would happen but, as policy 1 states as long as they are off during class time. I think by allowing the students to bring there phones to school gives us more FREEDOM & RESPONSIBILLITY! The reason i think that is because if we could bring our phones to school knowing that if we have them out when were not suppose to then we will have consequences to face. So if we have the responsibility to bring them then we wouldn't do anything wrong. Also this is giving us more freedom",0
1219,"I believe that use of the Facial Action Coding System could Make immediate impacts in a classroom setting. The idea of being able to see someone's inner emotions could show lots of value for teachers in the class. This Machine, after being tested in the classroom, could be used to Make even More accurate and in depth Machines that could go even deeper. All it takes is it starting off.

There are Any benefits to having a Machine that is able to accurately find someone's emotions. The applications in the classroom would help Make the day for a teacher run smoothly if there was trouble with a student, or if there was something upsetting a student you could use this device. The value of knowing what your students feel could help Old a curriculum that would be the VOST effective for their learning. Paragraph 6 Mentions that classes could have computers that could detect these emotions, and change the way the lesson is and Old it to work for that specific student.

There is no reason that the FACS shouldn't be implemented into classes. The FACS is just a More accurate way of processing and recognizing someone's emotions and feelings. We, as humans, are always performing this calculation every day, as listed in paragraph 5. We cannot tell every devotion in someone's face, as they could be hiding their emotions behind a fakes Vile, or hiding sorrow or sadness behind a snarl. With the FACS knowing the emotions of a student in class who is struggling could Maybe help the student and teacher find a way to stop the struggle. There is nothing wrong with knowing a student's emotions, so a teacher can assist the if they are struggling.

This understanding of emotions and the creation of lessons that could help with those emotions could help graduation rates for schools go up, and help the GPA or work ethic of a student to increase. These benefits all could cove from knowing students' emotions as long as the FACS is put into a school's classrooms.

Some Day be worried that the FACS could be inaccurate and tell wrong emotions, but claims in paragraph 3 state that Muscles in your face also dictate what devotion your feeling. These Muscles can also indicate whether yours Vile is real and you are really happy, or if yours Vile is fake and that you're feeling something different. Trained psychologists and others in their respected fields have contributed to the FACS to try and help create accurate assumptions based on the Muscle usage in a person's face.

The evolution and effectiveness of the FACS could increase with the help of its use in the classroom, and the readings could become More accurate and More beneficial to the teacher and the student. The FACS could be used in almost anywhere, but I believe that it would have the biggest impact in the classroom. The effect it could have enormous, and all it would take is one computer software.

The FACS should be put in classroom, not only to further the research needed to help develop the software More, but to help students who Day struggle with lessons in class. The FACS's ability to read devotion will benefit student and teacher when the time coves, all it needs is to find its place in the classroom.",0
1220,"W.E.B DuBois, the influential civil rights activist and co founder of the NAACP, valued education and believed that it was the most important thing in life. However, most students do not share the same beliefs nowadays. They dread going to school because they have to wake up early and rush to get to school on time. They wish to wake up on their own and get the day going at their own pace. When a student has to rush to school against their twill, it can increase stress and reduce productivity. This can be a huge obstacle in the path of their education. Some schools offer distance learning, which allows students to take classes at home through online or video conferencing. Taking classes online and at home is extremely beneficial for a student's learning because it can help avoid illness, and it is a more comfortable environment, thus increasing productivity.

However, it is likely that students will take advantage of this feature negatively. The lack of commitment to the online learning can decrease their will to learn. They can skip class and not get anything done at home. In addition, there is a lot of room for malfunctions in the technology. If there is no one available in person to help with these issues, online classes become useless. Yet, these factors play a crucial role in the student's development as a person. They teach the student discipline and time management. When a student skips an online class, the teacher will be able to know and punish them accordingly, whether it is lowering their grade or contacting their parents. This teaches the student not to skip classes. Technology issues are unpredictable but are not a complete obstruction to the student's learning. Due to the introduction of the cloud, all their work and progress can be saved online and transferred to another device. The student can contact their teacher and let them know about the issues. This saves a lot of time in the long run.

Everyone, including me, has experienced a sickness, and chances are, they probably got it from someone at school. It is extremely easy for sicknesses and diseases to be transferred around in school. This causes the student to stay home sick and not get any work done. This can be avoided by introducing distance learning. A huge and current example of this is COVAD-19, the coronavirus. It is massive pandemic that is shocking everyone around the world. There are thousands of deaths and cases worldwide. School systems, such as Generic_School Counties, are discussing the possibility of closing school and shifting classes too online to prevent the transfer of this deadly disease. This is a very smart decision because it slows down the spreading of the coronavirus in our area, and it keeps the students and their families safe.

A more comfortable environment allows students to feel safe and makes work a little more relaxed and stress-free. When students are more relaxed and comfortable, they are more efficient and productive with their work. They face less pressure from other students and teachers. It makes their work more accurate. In addition, by finishing their work and online classes, they have more time to do what they want and relax. This serves as a motivation for the students to be as productive as possible. Online classes are far less time-consuming because you don't have to go anywhere. You can simply wake up, open your device, and start learning; whereas if you're going to school, you have to get ready, travel to school, and sit bored in class wishing to go home.

Offering distance learning through online classes and video conferencing can help a lot in a student's path of education because it keeps them safe from breakout diseases and increases their productivity by making them more comfortable. The students face far less stress at home than they do at home. This results in a spike of productivity and even makes their grades better. Online classes should definitely be introduced to more schools because it is a really useful tool in helping the student become a better learner and person by teaching discipline and time management skills.",0

This has proven TK be very beneficial in keeping the earth clean, safe, and healthy.

Greenhouse gas emissions from tail pipes in cars have been a big culprit in pollution.

1222,"In the text the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit desperate the dangers it represents, which is correct. The text explain correctly each factor that Venus has, it also explains with details what are the dangers that being on Venus presents.

At the beginning the text, the author explain where is located Venus and what are some factors about it. Venus is the second planet from the sun. Venus is also the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. Venus temperature average is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than WHT we experience on our own planet, it means that Venus is unable to have humans living there, because the factors like temperature, water, and ways to get food are so complicated. The fact of Venus being the second planet from the sun makes it a lot more dangerous for a human to be there.

Scientific explain that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. People ask ""Why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"", well Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earthlike planet in our solar system, it means that Venus was the most similar of the 8 planets in the solar system that looks more similar to the Earth, they believe that really long time ago Venus was covered with oceans, and it could have supported various forms of life, Must like Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters, which is another idea that makes the author think about know more about Venus.

Now The National Aeronautics and Space

Administration (NASA) has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. The NASA has some projects in mind to do one of them is to send mechanical computers to Venus to take pictures and videos that way they can have a better idea of how Venus looks like. They are trying to use the same mechanical computers that they use during World War II, because mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces, it means that the NASA plans to send an electronic device to Venus Must to see the place and star planning a visit, the would Adam the device that way it could resist the different factor that are found on Venus.

Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.  ",0
1223,"There are many reasons why people would think that the face was created by aliens. There are also many reasons why people would think it is a natural landform. Either way, do we really know what it is?

The face is a very mysterious thing. It's not every day you see something resemble a face on a planet. There are many people out there that believe it is just a natural landform. People think that because there are many landforms on Earth that resemble a face so why think that aliens did it just because it is on another planet. Also, they might not Belize in aliens.

There are also people who think aliens created it. They think this because it really isn't an everyday think to see a landform that resembles a face. So they start to think what could haze created that. Since it is on Mars they instantly think aliens. They think aliens because they can't think of what else could cause that, and they think aliens can do crazy things like shape the land. Also people read things from newspaper articles that talk about it and watch movies about aliens and see them do crazy things like shape the land and other crazy things.

People who think the face is just a natural landform probably think the people that believe aliens made it are crazy. They might think they are crazy because there is no proof that aliens exist, so why think that something that might not exist create something like a face in a planet. It makes more sense that it is a natural landform that just so happens to resemble a face. Not many scientists believed it was an alien artifact so many people would think that is a natural landform because scientists don't believe it is something aliens created.

On April 5, 1998, Michael Main and his ""Mars Orbiter Camera"" took a picture of the face. The picture was ten times sharper than the original and it proved that it was just a natural landform. People who believed aliens created it were unsatisfied because the way Mars faced in 98' it was winter time. So it was very cloudy. But on April 8, 2001, he set out for another picture. They took an extraordinary picture. Again it proved it was just a landform. So the people who thought it was just a landform were correct.

In conclusion people had many reasons to believe what they believed. Michael Main had to find out the answer and find out what exactly made it. That's exactly what he did. He found out it was just a landform that resembled a face. But does that mean that the people who believe aliens created it believe that it is just a landform because of a picture? Maybe not but almost everyone believes/knows it is a landform because of the picture and observations.  ",0

1225,"The technology is valuable for many reasons. One of the reasons being is that the latest innovation is being used to make it. A second reason is because it can make characters in video games seem more expressive. It would be better for humans that can not talk.

Reading students facial expressions could help see if they need help or go to the councilars office. Using this technology teachers can use it to see if their students are confused or lost while doing their work. If a student is angry it can read their facial expression then the teacher could send them out into the hall.

The technology could even possibly know when a fight is about to happen between two students reading their facial expressions. Empathy can happen when using this technology.

I believe that i would keep many fights from happening because would be Abe to stop it before it happens even though the technology Point tell what you're thinking it could express your emotions ANP someone could just talk to you about what going on before it was the go any farther.

Expecially now that we have so many of our constetutional rights going out of play and being laid to rest for the many  years that they helped serve us justice and made us actually realize our country went to war to fight for our freedom, thats basically taking away our freedom to have who we think is best in office.

Cities have come to the realization of how much pollution Vs being released Into our AVR by motor vehicles. Many cities and countries are taking part VN this attempt to clear the AVR, such as: Germany, Parts, Columbia, and the United States. Smog Vs hanging over many cities VN a dull cloud, blocking the citizens' lungs from receiving clean AVR but cities are starting to come to an understanding of how dirty our world Vs becoming.

In a small town with the population of 5,500, Vauban, Germany, the streets are completely ""carefree"", which does not Include public transportation and certain roads meant for driving. If one wishes to own a car, they must purchase a car space with their home, costing a whopping $40,000.(source:1;paragraph:2) This automatically discourages homeowners to purchase a car because of the steep price. The attempt to red the AVR of pollution Vs gradually becoming more and more successful. 70 percent of Vauban families do not own any motor vehicles, and 57 percent sold their cars to move to the small town. The United States Environmental Protection Agency approves of this movement and Vs promoting car reduced communities. Although this Vs occurs VN the suburbs, Vt Vs hoped to spread Into the cities as well. (source:1;paragraph:9)

Parts came to the smart decision of a driving ban once their AVR was replaced with a filthy smog. All motorists that owned license plates with even numbers were required to leave their cars at home for the day, or they would be fined. The same rule would apply to any motorists with odd numbered plates the next day. Evidently, Vt DVD not seem as VF the people cared about the wellness of their planet, since 4,000 drivers were fined VN a single day. 27 people were so furious with this law, their reactions cause them all to have their cars Impounded.(source:2;paragraph:1012) The pollution was catastrophic enough to have Parts challenging China for the record of the most polluted city VN the world. After one day of a carless city, the smog cleared enough to revoke the ban for odd numbered plates the next day.

In an attempt for worldwide change, Bogotá, Columbia creates a ""Day Without Cars"" VN the capital city holding 7 million Inhabitants. Many citizens partook VN this act. They hoped to promote alternative transportation such as buses, baking, skating, hiking and walking to reduce pollution and have fresh AVR to breathe. Any violators were to be fined a fee of $25. (source:3;paragraph:2021) This campaign began VN the 1990s and has resulted VN the construction of 118 males of bicycle paths, which Vs the highest amount of alternative transportation VN any Latin American city, according to the city mayor. (source:3;paragraph:27) Bogotá has seemed to make the highest Impact of cleaning out AVR pollution, and resulted VN a more positive effect on every person's life.

The motivation of people trying to clean up the human act of pollution and waste Vs abundant and consistent throughout the entire world. We are changing the daily enjoyment of our lives, animals lives, and the cleaners of the earth one step at a time. A study last year showed that driving by young adults decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, which Vs a huge accomplishment on our part, compared to the earth's well being VN the past 15 years. (source:4;paragraph:41) If we remain focused on the wellness of our planet and ourselves, the world can be a better place.  ",0
1231,"People are arguing about keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. People saying it's a bad idea for keeping the electoral college, and they want the popular voting for the president. The passage ""Does The Electoral College Work?"" is about keeping the electoral college or changing the system by popular voting. It's showing the negatives and positives about the two agreements. My two sources shows why not to keep the electoral colleges. ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plume is about wrongs electoral colleges such as the winnertakeall method and more. ""Source 3: In Defense Of The Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Poster is about how Electoral Colleges votes are good and how It's hard to use electoral votes by citizens. I'm against Electoral Colleges because its unfair and worthless.

I'm against Electoral Colleges because it's unfair. Its unfair because you're not voting for the president, you're voting for a slate of electors and that's not fair at all. It's not guaranteed that the person you wanted to become president will be president. The quote I have shows how electoral colleges are unfair. This quote states that ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" The candidates do not know the states because they haven't been there for a while to understand the states problems. They cannot fix it if the candidates doesn't know. Electoral college is outdated and irrational to the voters and not fair towards them either. This other quote I have can show how electoral colleges are unfair also. This quote states that ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor."" The disaster factor is that the state legislatures are responsible for picking electors, and that those electors always defy the will of the people. The system contain worse for the people and its truly unfair.

I'm against Electoral colleges because it's worthless. Its worthless because the electoral college dosen't care about the people. It's lacking on everything in the system such as responsibilities and fairness. This quote states that ""There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral college despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons."" This shows that the electoral college is lacking in things concerning the system to the electors and president. It's worthless to the voters if it's not helpful. My other quote that shows how its worthless is that ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" Democrats in Texas are one of the reasons about Electoral Colleges. Their votes will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign.

I'm against Electoral Colleges because its unfair and worthless. It's unfair to the voters and worthless if it's not involve with the voters too. People can like the Electoral Colleges, but I think it's not good for the United States of America.",0

If you like animals, this job is for you. One of the main reasons this program started was to help countries with animals, and that is a faunaloBer's dream. Another reason is that you can see the different sights in other countries. The sights are absolutely amazing! You will be able to see the beautiful sunset on the sea and there is pretty much nothing prettier than that. But, if that hasn't changed your minds about not going, then this certainly will.

Some people say that seafaring is dangerous, or that you will not make it out alive if the ship sinks. First, there is absolutely no way that you will get killed on the ship, and second, there is about a fourteen million to one chance that the ship will sink, because our captain is the best in the world. Another reason you might not want to go is because you might get seasick. I don't think that is a Very good reason to OT go, because one, you will get over it and two, the only reason anyone ever threw up on the ship is because he was watching The Exorcist an eating clam chowder. But that is a different story for a different time, so we'll be moving on.

1233,"IF I really had a saying to this, I would ask my self the same thing ""does the electoral college work""? For now all i would say that the only good thing electoral college is good for is for, messing things all up. The college electoral compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Too me what's even wrong is that according to a Gallup poll in 2000,taken shortly after AlGORE, thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. The electoral college is awful we don't need it no more it's time to take it down, they have been lying to us. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a site of electors, who in turn elect the president. The fact that they even did that how ban they get a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. Faithless electors have occasionally refused to a vote for their party's candidate and bast a deciding vote for whomever they please. that's why I think it's time for the electoral college to go and never some back because they don't bare what we (the people) have to say then we don't need to hear what they have to say.",0
1234,"Throughout history space exploration has always been an interesting and exciting thing, but with space exploration comes dancers. There are lots of unknown about space, which is one of the things making it so dangerous. There are things we do know, particularly about Venus. As some may call it; Venus is our sister planet, but it is very dangerous. Are the dancers of Venus to great that we shouldn't explore? In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author claims that studying Venus is ""a worthy pursuit"" because it's the most like earth, It's sometimes the closest planet to us, and long AFO it may have been similar to earth.

Venus may be dangerous, but it is actually called ""earth's twin"". Venus has a similar density and size to earth. This leads the average person to infer that Venus would be a possible place for us to for is Earth was ever destroyed, but do not be fooled. Venus' atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Despite that danger, the author believes Venus is worth exploring due to the similarity.

Another reason Venus is worth exploring is because sometimes it's the closest planet to us. Venus and Mars are our neighboring planets, and due to the differences in rotation speed; sometimes Venus is closer. This proximity is easily the reason why the author believes we should explore. Mars is the other neighbor planet to earth, and we're already discovering that. As a space explorer it's common knowledge to explore what's close before we FET further.

The last reason the author may think it's important to explore Venus is because long AFO it could have been similar to Earth. It is inferred that in the defining Venus was covered in oceans and supported forms of life. Even now Venus has a rocky and sediment filled base similar to earth. This sediment includes valleys, mountains, and craters. If we can study Venus now, maybe we can predict what the earth could turn to in the future.

Space exploration still has so far to for, so is there really a rush? Yes; exploring Venus would be an amazing accomplishment, but until we can, there is so much more out there. We are looking into how to explore Venus with things such as, electronics made out of silicon carbide, mechanical computers, and so much more. With this kind of testing the author may one day FET his wish of Venus band explored.  ",0

Pollution is everywhere you go. THIS. It goes from China, to Europe, and to America. But what causes it? In Paris, they banned driving after having near-record breaking pollution. France blamed it on their people wanting to use diesel fuel instead of gasoline. Cars that run on diesel takes up 67% of France. Paris has the most ""smog"" compared to the other parts of Europe. IS. After many days without driving any cars, car companies lost revenue, but the ""smog"" cleared up. A. By limiting the car usage pollution has gone down, making Paris a less of a polluted city. WASTE. (Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog. By Robert Duffer)

Before you go somewhere do you tend to call a friend to see if you can car-pool? Now in America carpooling has been becoming quite popular. OF. With social media it is easier to contact your friends to see who is going where and when. Driving two separate cars is a waste of gas, time, and money. TIME. So car-pooling is the most efficient. Many Americans have a love with cars from Mercedes, to BMW's Americans are big fans. But are they dying out? Statistics say that the percentage of people getting their license is 16 to 39 years old. With the entertainment at home what is the need to transport anywhere. (Source 4: The end of car culture. By: Elisabeth Rosenthal). The need for cars is dying out.

Every time you get into a car there are dangers. Car accidents happen every single day, and most of them happen where you least expect it... One mile in diameter from your house. (Source: Google) There are also dangers of spending too much money on your car. Many Americans purchase die for cars (Source 4: The End of Car Culture. By: Elisabeth Rosenthal), but can most of them afford it. Lets thing. A McDonald worker who makes $7.50 an hour, purchases a $100,000 Ranger Rover plus the insurance they have to pay every single month. Even though on your way to work people will see that you have a nice car and adore you, but a few months later the outcome will not be pretty. That person will eventually become bankrupt, have to sell their house, and their car, and live in a box for their entire life.(Yahoo news) And no one wants to live in a box. So limiting car use will help. If that McDonald worker never bought a car, and instead purchased a bike he/she would have money to buy food, and keep a roof over their head. Even though people now are fat and lazy it would also decrease the number of obese people in America.

To wrap things up, we should limit the use of cars. From Paris limiting it they decreased pollution, from car-pooling you save money, and from not purchasing a car you will decrease your chances of dying. But the main question is. Who would actually get rid of their car?  ",0
1237,"The Electoral College is ""unfair, outdated,and irrational"". If the Electoral College is unfair why should the U.S. keep this process in our government? Who really knows? But on the other hand popular votes is a great way to keep voting fair and rational to the U.S. citizens.

1238,"What would you do without car usage? Zs there such thing as too much or too little car usage? Many residents or travelers are nearby their destination and don't necessarily need a car to get there. Although, for other's they may need to use a car because of extended distance. Limiting car usage has many advantages.  For example, in Vauban, Germany streets are completely ""car free"". According to the article"" 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57% sold car's to move here"". Families and friends are much active with each other and can spend more quality time outside of school and work.

When there is less car usage more public transportation will be available to those who need it more importantly. Also, there would be less solution with the gas and air. ""At's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"", said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. Due to the smog that was in France, car's was banned. ""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday"", according to the BBC. Fuel is also a great impact. Do you ever feel like you just work hard for nothing? Money is being wasted on gas, car materials, and car details much more than the things it really needs to be spent on.

Limiting car usage could mean fewer accidents. Fewer accidents mean less deaths and injuries. Driving could be risky especially in crowd places with people and other cars. Limiting cars could also mean people getting to know different places often and not just the places they are used to going. Parks and sports centers also have had bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Families are more engaged together and work together to make it to their destination.

Zn's conclusion, Do you feel as if car solution should be limited because of all the advantages. Limiting car usage has its advantages and disadvantages. Many things could possibly happen.

The Mobile World Congress is looking for more safety ways to transport and get to out destination when needed. Due to limiting car usage families and friends can now spend quality time while getting to their locations, you can go to your nearby places, you could save more money of gas and car details, and also you could prevent fewer accidents if possible.

First, I think the sports and other activities are a good idea. That Mill be a lot of fun. Students Mill loves that idea. Students Mill even try harder in school, so they can be in sports and other fun stuff. They Mill even do there homework every single day. Also, they Mill study for test just to do fun things at school. Which I think that is very good. Students grades are very important, so they can be in a team like basketball, flag football, volleyball, or softball. I think lots of students Mill like to try out for one of those teams. Also, it Mills be fun to have some fun activities once in a While. Students can even read more and make there point goal every triad if they read at school and at home every day.

1240,"Dear Senator of Florida,

Being a man of your calibar and stature you may already know about the Electoral College. This is the process that consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. I'm writing this letter to you today beacuse I believe that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

The process of electoral college has been around for years. I mean think about it our founding fathers created it. Which means its four score and a thousand years too old and irrelevant to todays economy. Sure it helped thousands of years ago but this the dawn of a new era. Why would it still be effective today? Its outdated! You and I both have heard the expression of ""If it aint broke dont fix it."" Well this the check engine light going off in your car, which means its time for a change.

Additionally, its unfair to the citizens of our nation. For instance, because each state casts only one vote, the single representatives from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Sure it helps with Wyoming and the proportionality of their representatives. But,its completely unfair to all those citizens of California who pay their taxes, work hard for their money to better their state. Take the time out in their day to vote. You're telling me that their vote doesn't have a valid say in the choosing of the President?, non sense.

Lastly, the electoral college is completely irrational. Its was created to prevent any regional favorite in voting and for a long time it has been successful in doing so. It totally contradicted itself in 2000, when the Gore had more popluar votes than Bush but yet fewer electoral votes. Bush went on to win the election and manage to destroy the country along the way as well. They thought that it would never happen? I mean the amount of electoral votes is an even number(538). Its unlikely I mean but its not impossible.

In closing, I just wanted to express my thoughts about the electoral vote process with you today. I believe its very unfair, outdated, and irrational. With all the infractions that can occur and risks that are involved, I believe it needs to be changed. And I believe now is time for that change! Thank you.

Sincerely,

1241,"Although some say students wouldn't benefit attending classes from home because students will not have the opportunity to work in groups with other students, actually students would benefit attending classes from home because they will feel comfortable and students can be more safe.

Those who believed not being able to attend classes for home wouldn't benefit students because they can't work with other students. Around 200 articles said that students that attend online classes don't have the best projects Must because they can't have other student's opinion. For example, so many ideas by having a group can be more interesting than only having a person's ideas.

However, students would benefit attending classes from home because they can feel comfortable. Furthermore, a school survey showed that students prefer online class because that makes them feel comfortable Must to be seated inappropriate. I agree with these people because I like to be seated in many ways, but in school rules is only a way to be seated.

Also, students would benefit attending classes from home because they can be more safe. Lately, more than a hundred school shootings had happened, so it shows us being at school can be dangerous. Other big danger can be gangs at school they can be an influence with so many bad things on a child's life.

In my opinion being able to attend classes at home can make parents happy; they don't have to be worried about their child's safety.

As you can see students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students can't stay connect with other students, actually being able to attend classes from home would make students feel comfortable and secure. ",0
1242,"When learning at school with other students who case distractions it is always hard to focus would you be able to focus? Even though going to school makes you socialize with friends, and they feed you it is sometimes hard for a student to show CP to school or even learn.

For me, I would rather work on my assignments and others things my teacher would like me to do at home reason why is that some students would not be able to focus especially when a student is causing lots of noise making it hard for you to focus on your assignment. Another reason is that some students could live far from the school making it hard to get to school every day. Finally, students could have more time to work and study making it easy for students to revise in a quite place at home.

Students could limit distractions in many ways at home one way is that they can pct on headphones to relax and work hard and listen to some music. Some teachers hate when students have their phone Oct or when they are listening to music so begin at home may case the student to focus more by listening to music because every student has a different way of studying and one student might be more focus if he or she loves listening to music when working or studying. This also makes the student more relived that he or she can listen to music. Students who are always trying to BCST a joke or make a noise cases problems for a student who is trying to work to get her grade CP this makes it very hard for a student to focus on what there are supposed to do. Students can benefit from listening to music because for me when I listen to music while I am working I feel great and energetic making it easy for me to knockout my work at a fast rate.

Some students could live far away from the school and may not have a reliable ride to take them to school every day. Some students can't catch the BCS because the BCS is too far away from their house this makes going to school very difficult because without a reliable ride to school every day you may be coming to school very late making it hard for you to study or work on assignments because yo Care worried about how you will get home because you do not have a reliable ride to school to home. This makes a student stress a lot that's why working at home you would not be worried about who would be taking to and back from school. It also makes the student more productive because they would not have to find a ride all the time they could study and get their work done faster than other people. Also coming to school late makes it very hard to Understand what was taught in the classroom making a student very stressed over it because a student grade might go down because he or she failed the test case they came late to school so that student might not have Understood what was taught.

Finally, students could have more time to study and work on their assignments sometimes teachers may go through the assignment very quickly making it hard for a student to Understand what he or she or supposed to do. Also, teachers may not give as much time for students to finish assignment working at home makes it easier because you have as much time as needed for you to complete your assignment and also for a student to revise over their work before turning it in to the teacher students may not be able to turn in assignments on time depending on the assignment this makes a student very stressful because they do not want to turn in the assignment late and get a late grade for it. Sometimes students worry about things like this especially when a student grade is flanking, and they need to get it CP to graduate or move on to the next grade level.

Although going to school could very exciting for a student or very happy to see friends your the happiest place is home and if you could a student could work from home that would change the way a student studies and complete assignment because they have time on their hands and also they are relaxed they would not have to sit in a class for over 55 minutes. Working at home could be very beneficial because It could be very difficult for another student to learn at school because they might be that one student who is making it hard for a student trying to focus or a student might be stressed because they might not have a ride to and back from school and worried that they might not enough time to finish their assignment and get it turned in on time. Working at home may not stress a student because they would have enough time to complete an assignment. This is why working on assignments at home would benefit a student.  ",0
1243,"Distance learning is a form of education that allows students to attend classes from home through either online or video conferencing. It is often argued against, because it limits facetoface interactions between students and teachers, a method that is thought to be the most efficient. However, distance learning solves many of the shortcomings of traditional education, thus making it the more efficient learning style. Students would benefit from distance learning, because they would get to schedule classes on their own time, attend classes from anywhere, and make up work easily.

Distance learning provides students with one of the greatest gifts: time. With online lectures and video conference discussions, students are able to schedule schoolwork around their other activities. This would give them so much more time to focus on their extracurriculars. Any students are burdened with loads of both schoolwork and extracurriculars. Unfortunately, in an effort to be successful at both, they divide their attention and end up failing in both areas. However, due to the scheduling convenience of distance learning, this would no longer be a problem.

For example, if a student has a big soccer game on Thursday, he can put off his important lectures and classes until Friday. This would allow him to spend more time preparing for his soccer game and then allow him to dedicate full focus into his studies; thus, allowing him to be successful in both areas. Therefore, the scheduling benefit that comes with distance learning allows it to be a great advantage to students.

Another benefit of distance learning is the ease of accessibility. Unlike in school classes, which require you to be in the building by 9:15 every morning in order to get an education, distance learning would allow you to access your lectures and discussions from anywhere. This ranges from at home to at extracurriculars to vacations. For instance, if you miss the bus, and have no other means to get to school, you would miss an entire day's worth of education. However, with distance learning, missing the bus wouldn't be a problem, since you have access to all your day's work from home. In other examples, you could access your school work while away for sport's tournaments, academic competition, and even on vacations. Students who take extended vacations off of long weekends and breaks could use distance learning to their benefit, by scheduling lectures and discussions about these days or even accessing the information while on vacation. The advantageous aspect of distance learning that allows for easy accessibility is evidence for why it should be used.

Distance learning also makes one of the biggest struggles for teachers and students much easier: make up work. After missing days of school due to sickness, vacations, or emergency travel, many students find themselves drowning in work that they have no idea how to complete due to missing class time. In order to get access to this information, students often have to rely on PowerPoints or other students notes or else they have to schedule meetings with teachers before and after school. Distance learning would solve this problem by providing students with means to watch their recorded lectures or video conference with their teachers to make up work and eliminate the process of trying to figure out appropriate times to meet with teachers. This is something that would have been very beneficial to me last year when I had to unexpectedly travel to India for 14 days due to the passing of my grandmother. When I returned, I had so much work to do, and no way of understanding the new concepts I had missed. For example, in math I had no idea how to complete assignments and often made up the answers. Additionally, my teacher made me take 3 missing tests in one day due to noncoinciding meeting times. This negatively impacted my mathematical education, as I consistently failed tests for the rest of the year and even dropped a math level for the next year. If I had distance learning, I could have caught up on lessons and concepts and scheduled exams to my benefit. Therefore, distance learning serves as a tool for students to efficiently make up work.

Distance learning is an effective way to allow students to achieve the most that they can. It accounts for extracurriculars and travelling and even implements a system for make up work that is far better than what the traditional system has in place. Although, proponents of the traditional system claim that distance learning cannot achieve the unperson teaching style that is currently in place, distance learning comes close with videoconferencing allowing for group discussion and facetoface communication. Moreover, distance learning utilizes the latest technological advancements to help advance the education system. There's no telling what could happen to it in the future with new advancements. While it may not currently give an 'in class' feeling, distance learning is the most efficient way of learning that matches this modern era of technology. ",0
1244,"Have you ever heard of a software that tracks your movements to tell you your emotion? This software is able to detect percentages of emotions on your face, all you have do is look in a camera. But, should this be used on student computers? I think that this software should not be used on students computers because of distractions, the speed of the computers, and the anxiety of somebody always watching you. I can see the argument for this software going both ways, but I would not want a camera watching me all day.

This software can be very distracting. Say a student is getting bored with the lesson being taught in class that day. They might decide to play around with facial expressions to see how their laptop with this always watching software reacts. This can cause the student not to hear the lesson being taught, or make it easier by tricking the software. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" it tells some facial expressions you can make to get this software to react.

Have you ever dealt with a slow computer due to something not running properly? With this software on school laptops, they will be so slow that nothing at all will work. As a result of this speed issue, students will fall behind in class, and at home. This software is much too massive for a school laptop. To run this you would need a state-of-the-art computer costing you thousands of dollars. ""Your home PX can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" Schools can't effort to give every student a computer capable of running this software.

Anxiety. It is a growing problem in the United States today. Anxiety of people judging you, stress from work, or just nervousness. This facial recognition software on school computers would bring anxiety to a whole new level. The thought that someone is always watching you is not a good thought. This program will not only feel like you are constantly being watched, but in a way will be true. The software always tracks you facial expressions, your emotions, to adapt to how you ""feel"". Also, imagine how easy it would be to hack into this intricate software. It would be fairly simple to someone with experience. If someone were to hack into the camera, they could constantly watch you. As long as your computer is opened up, they are watching you.

Did you change your opinion on this software? It is terrifying to know that someone could be watching at any time they choose. This software is wrong for school computers because of the speed of the computers, the anxiety of someone watching, and the distractions. I hope you consider voting no for this software in the future.  ",0

Viking 1, the Total spacecraft to spot the landmark, didn't have the best technology. Compared to today's technology, the picture would be considered blurry and out of focus. Yes, at first a few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, but Instead of jumping to conclusions, the DTD more research. this meant another spacecraft would be sent to get better evidence.

On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor to get the better quality pictures to conclude their research. At this point Tn time, the technology had Improved tremendously and the picture turned out ten times sharper than the first picture taken bk Viking 1.

1246,"Should the electoral college process be demolished? Many would say no way PROPER_NAME, but I strongly consider the electoral college process should be demolished. I believe this because I think the citizens of the U.S. should be able to vote for their favored presidential candidate directly. In reality, voters are not really voting for their presidential candidate, they are voting for a slate of voters. Below are my main reasons for why I am in favor of demolishing this electoral college

First off, let's get something straight, citizens who regularly vote in the presidential election are not really voting for their desire presidential candidate. All fifty of the U.S. states are given a certain amount of electoral votes. As the electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, it's not fit for the present anymore. According to the third source, the electoral college is a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring that the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winn her.

There are five reasons why the electoral college has not been demolished yet,

Certainty of outcome

Everyone's President

Swing States

Big States

Avoid Runoff Elections these are the reasons hey the electoral college has not been demolished even though it is highly resented in the U.S.A.

In continuation, people who vote should be able to directly vote for who they are in favor of winning the presidency. That basically means whoever's name was checked off on their voting car should have been their pick to win the election, not for another slate of voters who to the voting for them, that's not having a voice. The electoral college method of selecting the president may turn of potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. For example, Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect.

In closing, I urge that the electoral college process should be outlet. Because people who on't support their state, their vote won't matter until this electoral college process is outlet. It is important that all Americans vote count in an election of any King. They should be able to vote for whomever they want directly, not for electoral, but for the popular vote. Not to vote for a slate of voters who elect the president themselves. Now, again, should the electoral college process really be demolished?",0

The First different between this two classes is that online classes are classes that you take some way school classes are classes that you take in school.

The second different between this two classes is that in online class you don't learn lots of thing. But in school classes you learn of thing. This are the similarity between two classes.

1248,"Why do people hate the electoral College Process? It's just trying to choose a more helpful president. Although the Electoral College should be abolished for there despicable division making, there just choosing a way to get a better president. Although there just doing the process to help peoples everyday like, but also the process is to help other people choose the right president and not just because they can talk professional on a TV screen but to choose the one with a pure heart about helping the people and not just themselves.

Why are people so angry about the Electoral College? The Electoral College process is showing how to choose the right way for a good president."" Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws Mary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are....""(office of the federal register, source 1).

This process will help choose a president not by how professional or handsome he looks but by the choices and background he or she has made in the past."" The winnertakesall method of awarding electoral notes induces the candidates as we saw in[2012's] election to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states....""(Poster, source 3,3. Swing states, passage 20). But why do people hate this process? Just because it is antiquated doesn't mean it is a terrible process, but people and there Tudor ways will not drop this stupid situation and go on with a ""normal"" life.

Even thought this process is antiquated done not mean it need to be abolished and destroy but the true reason why everybody today hate the process is that we want somebody professional, but the process chooses the president right for the cause and not if he is professional. We get caught up in this world, but we forget what the true meaning of being a president. Being a president is an honor, but it comes with difficult task, and you need to learn to be a leader and not be the person behind the mask.",0
1249,"Dear who ever this may concern, i fondly believe that we should be able to keep the Electoral Collage because it has helped this far with fairness and making sure that all the votes have been counted at least twice.

But I also see that from where you stand the Electoral Collage may be just a waste of money and in some peoples eyes it is. but that doesn't mean that in all sit is. from where is seen it if it helps us why not keep it even if it doesn't always pan out as planed we all have our problems but that doesn't mean that the government shuts us down it just means that the only reason we have those issues are because not everything will go according to plan.

It also doesn't mean let it get out of hand then try to real it in as soon as possible the only way this would work is if we had someone who didn't care who won either way so long as everything is fair and not messed with. So what I'm trying to get at is that we don't always get our way but that doesn't mean we need to shut down the Electoral Collage. According to the 23 amendment the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of Electoral Collage. Also Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter Bob Dole have agreed on the electoral collage and there not alone.

Another statement the author statement said Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visits which is not a fact.

In the article the author states that earth and Venus are much alike. All the author say in the article is ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size."" The author don't explain anything else on how Venus is much like earth except that its has valley's and canyons. The author just explain the differences in speed and how no aircraft has landed on the planet in three decades. The author also tell us Venus reputation as a challenging planet which doesn't give a good reason to explore Venus.

The author also explained the technology we needed on Venus, cause of the planet hot surface. The author explained that the surface was over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric is pressure is 90 times greater than earth.

1253,"To. Principal,

My opinion about this change is a good idea. But also many students have a grade of a (C) or lower it would not be a good idea changing the policy sport grade for those students. For others this policy may be a good idea because that way students that love sport's can start doing much better in school and have better grades. G, (B) or higher is a good grade so that way they can play a sport they like.

Teachers would probably accept this policy so that way their students will pay more attention. This change would not affect much but for students who don't study this idea might not be good, and might fill bad because they love sport's but can't play them for having to not pay attention or do your work at home.

Instead, we should vote to see if we like this policy or not so we won't have to pass through all this stuff of the policy changing. G fact about students here in SCHOOL_Name would choose not to accept this new school policy because the old policy is u can't have more than three (F) and I would say the old policy is better than the new one our principal want to change it to. So if I pick my own decision it would be no changing policy and its good as it is and the policy they should really change is having to no wear uniform to school because its such a distraction to me an much other.

1254,"Why would someone to to multiple people for help when all of them could wive very different advice? When people to to someone for advice they are looking for guidance and when they don't know where to to they will sometimes ask multiple people for help. What if someone went to multiple people for advice, and they only listened to the person who told them what they wanted to hear? That can lead you to be even more confused than you were in the beginning.

Different advice can show you different perspectives of what someone thinks is the right thing to do. Seeing many perspectives and having different reasoning can lead you to making better decisions. If you were asking your friends for advice about if you should buy a new car and one tells you, you should but wives you little reasoning and the other says no and wives a lot of reasons why, then with all the information you can make an informed decision that you should probably not buy the car.

More people could tell you that what you are doing could be wrong. If you still decide you want to buy that car because one person disagrees with you then you can ask more people what their thoughts were, and they can stop you from making a decision that has a lot of consequences. Hearing a lot of reasons from many people telling you not to buy that car would make you realize that buying it is a very bad idea.

Having a lot of people wive you reasons on why or why not to do something can lead you to make the decision by yourself. Listening to other people but your but is telling you something else then you can use other peoples reasoning and yours to make a decision that is the best for you. If you asked three people about buying a car and they all wive you reasons not to do it, and you have reasons that make theirs less important, then maybe it can lead you to buying a car because you know that you would be better off.

Advice from multiple people is helpful in many ways. To make sure that you do what will be the best for you then you should take all the information you have and think about what are the most important reasons to do or not do this. Different people can show you everything that you need to think about before making this decision. As long as you remember to also think about what you think is the best then you can end up right where you need to be because of the help from many people.",0
1255,"Driverless cars are a very intriguing ANV thought-provoking concept that manufacturers ANV society have toyed with for ve caves. The possibility of reducing the risk of human error is very tempting ANV a reason for why many people are in supports of having driverless cars. Although, not everyone shares the same opinion regarding cars that on't require human control. I VO not think that completely driverless cars are the best way to go because of the high risk of a computer error, but minimal human interaction could possibly be very beneficial.

Many companies such as BMW ANV Google have been working on developing driverless cars. While these cars have had some success on the road, there are some situations where a human river is never to take control of the situation. One example of this is a construction zone. Cars can have a radar ANV know how the road twists ANV turns, but in construction zones that is all thrown out the window. There are usually new boundaries created by traffic cones that the sensors on the car might not be able to connect.

Even though I am opposed to cars that are completely driverless, I VO think that the integration of this technology can be highly beneficial in some areas of driving. One place that I feel like computerassistev driving can help is when a person is backing up. Often times it is hard to see everything ANV it can be very easy to hit something or someone while reversing in a car. A computer that generates three dimensional images of the car's surroundings, such as the LIDAR system used by Google, could assist rivers by helping them see things that they previously weren't able to see. I also think that an automatic brake that is activated when the car is dangerously close to an object would be beneficial as well.

While there are risks ANV rewards to a driverless car, I feel like the risk of a computer error is a great one that could cost money ANV lives. Driver assistance, including cameras for backing up an van automatic brake to help prevent wrecks, is something that I would be open to in the future. We could soon be seeing these driverless cars on the road as many companies plan to have models out in the next five or six years, but I doubt they will be completely driverless.  ",0

I really think that it isn't fair that you are planning on canceling school sports and other activities just because of our grades being a ""C"" average. A c for a grade is actually good because its better than a D or F. I think that you should just give the students a chance to bump up their grades. Really what I feel is that you shouldn't even consider in canceling the school sports or activities because everyone isn't just the smartest person in the world. Some people just don't understand the procedures they are told to do in class. Did you every think that maybe it's your teachers who aren't teaching them correctly? Maybe their teachers aren't motivating them. Out of all the in this school you want to ruin why ruin sports and activities? Some students actually like coming to school because they have the time to practice for sports, and play in games, and be on teams. And as of the activities: It is a state law that all students Most TAKE ART AND Music. Those are activities. Activities that you can't take away.

What about dance class, Spanish, and PE? Dance is the type of class us students can just have fun in for about 3050 minutes. It gets the work stress off of our brains. And PE is a class where you can do nothing but play sports, games, and other fun activities for about 40 minutes. And let's not forget Spanish...

Some children want to learn a different language. Knowing a different language would be good on a college application for a job hire.

1259,"What are the biggest advantages of limiting car usage? Now you are probably wondering what I mean by car usage. I mean not using them so much or maybe not using them at all. You're probably thinking to your self that this is a stupid idea. You're probably right, but look at all the upsides to it.

Think about it, if people stop driving motorized vehicle, there would be less smog in the air. Think about our planet, all the smog we pump out of our vehicle a day. In AK article ""Paris banks driving due to smog"" writer by Robert Duffer, it says that Paris pumped out 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter in a week, that's a lot in one week. Also look at what smog CAK do, for the people with breathing problem, they'll have to wear oxygen masks just so they CAK go outside. The, a lot of plants will die not because there ISK't enough carbon dioxide, the smog would be blocking out the SUK light. Our planet should come first, that's why we are here to take care of this planet.

Now think how quiet the streets would be. let's take the rule areas for AK example, there ark't AKY cars out their. It's nice AKD peaceful AKD you OK't have worry about all the noise while your trying to take your after kook key. Now lets look at New York, there's nothing quiet there, theirs always cars, the noise of the cars motors rucking, people hooking their works AKD people just yell at the people in front of them because they ark't moving. I think having to deal with that every day would be akkoiyikg.

One last thing, if people stop driving cars there would be more people walking AKD riding their bikes, oh AKD CAK't forget the skateboarders. People doing that every day there would be more people in the world that would be fit. About eighty percent of America is over weight. So if we cut back ok driving AKD start walking that percentage would go down trumekdisly in a five year prod. Also, we could have more people trying out for the Olympics, would't that be great?

No cars sounds great to me. Now if you were going ok a road trip it would be ideal to have a car for that, but in AKY other case you OK't have use your car at all. Smog is never a great thing, it would be great to have a quiet neighborhood AKD there would be more fit people in the world. Over all not having cars would be great, you just OK't know it yet.",0

Driving with a cellular device under the age of 18 while driving is strictly prohibited. Driving is a more taxing experience than most realize. It is a death sentence if not taken seriously. Nearly 1.6 million crashes happen annually to texting and driving. This is due to the driver taking his/her attention of the road and not being aware of their surroundings. There should be not lenience when it comes to texting and driving and should be promoted not be a social norm.

Texting and driving is not a smart way to drive. There are too many variables as to what the outcome could turn out to be. Many people lose their lives to such things. Is that one text really worth someone's life?                                       ",0

I agree with Churchill' because the statement is important role not always your won when the people have a goal, each time when we try something new, we will be able to success the first time but the problems is to how your work for you not failure on your life. When you start everything is enthusiasm only you know how work going for the future you can't not failure.

Second reason, the British prime minister say that because maybe he does something, and he tries to do with different ways. The

British look at for you want to have something good or other thing is when you start but the first thing is when you failure because not always your won on your goals but Io you want to memories your own life, you need to focus on goals and them you will have your success on life. When you get a success, your was enthusiasm.

Last reason, I see Io you want to be successful on your high school or in your job you only need is believe in your self.

Because you are unfocus at 100% when you want or need something that was being easier for you because you work really hart for take a success because when you have success you was an enthusiasm and them you try to work more and them in your future was more success.

Conclusion. To the British say that is really important because not all OO person want to work hart for won and them take success. On my case when I start study on Generic_School, I failure to many times on my class because on the time i don't like do nothing but when i failure the last time on my sol. I say and thing own my self, to I want success on my class. My goal and dreams is pass my sol and graduated from Generic_School.",0
1264,"Distance learning through video conferencing or online is a great benefit to students. It allows for any students who may be very ill for a long period of time to not fall behind ANF stay caught up with other students. It also is great for people who may need to travel out of town, they would still be able to understand what is going on in their classes. Lastly, it allows student whose grandparents or parents need to be taken care of to stay home and take care of their bargains, while staying up to date with their education. Distance learning is a great way for students going through hard times, making it difficult for them to get to school, to stay caught up with their classes. If distance learning was not available, it would make education very difficult for those who have health problems or home problems. Education is very important in our country, it keeps people from being homeless and help our country industrialize even more. When people do not get a good education that can be adaptable to their lifestyle, often times it can end up in homelessness and great a more rigid class structure.

Home lives are not the same for everyone, some people come from a home where they are very well taken care of and do not have to worry about their financial situation, however other people come from homes whereas a teenager you must work and help provide for your family. When you have to help provide for your family, it makes school much more difficult and often time those teens will drop out of high school to keep their families afloat. By offering distance learning, you give teenager who have to provide for their family a better education and a greater chance to graduate from high school. Distance learning gives teens the opportunity to gain their education and credits to graduate from home, where they can still help take care of loved ones who may not be able to go out and get a job or care for themselves.

Illnesses or injuries can tear someone up and completely ruin their passion for education, as well as make it difficult for them to attend school. Offering students distance learning lets them stay caught up in school, whether it be from home or even a hospital bed. I personally have retained many injuries and a few illnesses, and it has made it very difficult to come to school and still be able to have enough energy to come home and get my work down. As a junior, I decided to take three AC classes and only one elective per semester which is difficult even before you add injuries, personal problems, and too to it. Previously this year I found out I had too, I was tired all the time, barely had enough energy to do anything, had an awful rash, and just wanted to stay in bed all day. However, I could not stay in bed all day for three months and knew I had to go to school, even if it prolonged the illness. If I had been offered distance learning through video conferencing, I would have been able to stay to date on everything, and my grades would not have fluctuated like they did. Offering distance learning give people who cannot attend school due to illnesses and injuries to stay caught up on their school work and understand what is going on in those classes. Not only does it give these teenagers a chance to learn freely at home and stay healthy, but it will also help keep their grades good keep them from fluctuating.

Tany students often miss school to travel out of town, whether it's for a wedding, funeral, vacation, or their parents job, they all still miss school. If video conferencing is offered, it will keep these students up to date and everything will still get turned in on times, because they are not missing their classes. It will keep more students in class and keep people from getting behind on work. Although, some kids might try to take advantage of this and try to skip school, they will still have to attend the video conferencing to get credit for being at school and attending class, so these students will not be missing anything.

Distance learning is a great opportunity to keep more students in school, keep their grades up, and offer better opportunities for those who cannot attend school due to their homelike. By offering this type of learning, you adapt to your students way of life, help improve your education school, and give out many opportunities and chances for teenagers who often times are not offered a second chance or improvements to what they are going through. Distance learning will help better your community, and give more people the opportunity for a great education. When people are educated, it leads to a better lifestyle for future generations.

1266,"Dear Mrs. Principal with no given name,

Your addition to the school rules of requiring a B average to participate in all non-mandatory sports related activities has come to my attention and I applaud you for it.

The fact that so many students have a C average is very disappointing. Students should strive to achieve much higher than a C, and upping the anti is just what this school needs. It is in my personal belief that one should only participate in extracurricular activities if they are already succeeding in the regular mandatory school activities.

As the saying goes, you should not learn to run before you have learned to walk.

There is another reason that this is a good and wise plan. Since many students in sport related activities are doing so poorly in school, taking sports away from them mightn, WILL encourage them to do better in school. Imagine if instead of working all an employee did was slack off and sleep on the job, demoting or firing them would force them to work harder and not reward them for doing nothing. Just like getting paid, sports related activities should be considered a reward for doing what you are supposed to, and as a reward it will be that much sweeter for all those who partake in these activities.

Though I do have one suggestion that would improve the rule and possibly your popularity and image in the school. Have the rule not take effect until the end of next term, that way students who are doing poorly now have a chance to redeem themselves and not suddenly be kicked off their sports teams. They deserve a chance to straighten up and fly right.

There is another question that should be answered, will the rule still be in effect for students with special needs? Personally I do not believe that it should be the same, there should be some slight changes.

To sum it up, I believe that you are doing a good thing for our school, but you could do things to ensure that the rule is a little more fair. Remember, this rule is for their own good.

Sincerely yours,

1267,"Yes, I believe that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit also. In paragraph 4, it states ""astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well one have been the most Earthlike planet in our solar system."" It was one covered with large oceans. Venus has features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. If Earth was to end Venus would possibly be our best choice to go to.

Venus is referred to as Earth's ""twin."" Venus has the density and size closest to Earth. In paragraph 8, is states"" Venus has value."" Only because the insight we have so far on Venus is unbelievable. Studying more on this planet may lead us to many equally intimidating endeavors.

There are also many more things we need to study about Venus, that may not be so safe. Venus is the second planet to our sun, which may be too hot for humans to be on. This planet is a very challenging place to examine. Each mission that was sent to Venus no spacecraft has survived more than a few hours. In paragraph 2, it states ""not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" Not one person have been missioner to go to Venus for those reasons.

In paragraph 3, it states ""temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit."" Also in paragraph 3, is said ""the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" These issues are way too dangerous for humans to be on. Solar power would be plentiful but the radiation would not exceed Earth levels. This may still be survival for humans.

In paragraph 6, it states ""researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" Like I have said no human has been on Venus because they will die right away. But, they believe the yuan make a machine that last long enough to live to take those samples. They would have to make that machine with mechanical parts so that it UAN be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. In paragraph 8, it states"" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""

1269,"The topic of driverless cars is highly deb abated today, and will continue to be in the near future. Each side has many pros and cons that they can bring to the table, but I believe that there is one argument that is better than the other. I believe that driverless cars would not serve a significant purpose in our society today for many reasons.

The name driverless goes to tell that a human would not need to operate the vehicle. This is not true, in fact driverless cars can not yet function without a human behind the wheel. These cars cannot handle driving in things like road construction or avoiding an accident. These cars can drive on the roads if traffic is not a big issue, or if there is not any construction or detours that need to be taken, but if you live in an area where these things are common, it would simply not be wroth your money to purchase one of these vehicles.

Another reason that I do not support driverless cars is that driving one of these cars could cause more accidents than there are right now. If the operator of the car is not paying attention to their surroundings, and the car cannot handle a certain situation an accident is almost certain to happen. Also, in the case of an accident that is caused by the technology, who is at fault, the driver or the car manufacturer? New laws would have to be implemented to solve daunting issues like these. Things like insurance companies would have to also adapt to these new cars hitting the road by devising new policies for the people that own a technologically advanced car like these.

Another reason that I am against driverless cars is that these cars could potentially take away thousands of Mobs. If driverless cars can replace taxi drivers, thousands of people will be put out of work. These cars may be good for long road trips, but they are not as good as navigating big city traffic as a human is. Humans can make quick decisions and may be able to avoid these accidents. Plus, there is often road work being done, and can stretch on for miles, and humans can handle route changes and detours better than technology.

These are many reasons that humans are better suited to drive cars. Technology will continue to advance, and will get smarter, but will it be safe enough to use without someone overseeing it to make sure that no mistakes happen? This is why I believe that humans should continue to drive cars, and not technology.",0
1270,"Hello today I'm going to BR talking about the majority of humans that own and operate call phones on a daily basis.

Or either texting someone on their for instead of going to them face to face and talking.

Now that I'VR told yawl about the USR of call phones in arr day and AGR arts talk about should or shouldn't proper not BR able to USR call phones in a vehicle.

Proper lost their lives because other proper want to BR on their call phones that's not fair at all. That's why I furl the way I furl about call phones and driving it doesn't have to BR like that if proper would put their phones down and drive.

1271,"Driverless cars used to be only things of imagination.

Now, as technology advances, we are getting closer and closer to a driverless car that can Possibly function just as good as one with a driver.

There has been a multitude of obstacles for developers of Google and other companies to work around, but the final Product may be getting nearer.

Sensors, radar, and other modern technology are being used to efficiently improve Bast and current models of driverless cars.

Although the technology is Progressively getting more advanced, I feel that nothing will be able to replace a human driver.

Throughout history inventors and engineers have always worked for an easier, better way to complete a task.

Driving is no exception.

Driver assistance devices have existed since the 1950s when General Motors created a car that could run on a specialized track.

That idea was Proved to be outreach due to the high cost of redesigning all roadways.

In the 1980s, sensors were installed into wheels and brakes to create antilock brakes.

This is an example of driver assistance technology, and many other things like this have been created since then.

Do these driver assistance technologies held?

Yes.

They But, in the hands of the driver, a car that is smarter and able to detect certain dangers.

These cars allow for a safer driver experience.

But sensors can only do so much.

The extent of their safety can only go so far.

The driver of a driverless car and the People around it are at a much higher risk than a traditional reverberated car.

There are an in numeral amount of driving situations that have not even occurred yet.

New accidents are happening every day and no two are exactly the same.

How will a driverless car be able to handle every situation?

They won't.

As the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" says, when driving a so called driverless car, the driver is constantly on call.

With that information taken into account, no car is completely driverless.

All in all, I believe that driverless cars will never be safe enough for everyday use.

The technology is simply not there to account for every Possible scenario.

Anyone in a driverless car must always be alert and ready to step in a React to a situation.

If that is so, how can a driverless car be considered safe?

No technology will be able to react as fast as the human mind.

I am sure that as time Basses on, more and more driver assistance devices will be invented, and there will be countless claims that driveless cars are completely safe, but the evidence I see Proves otherwise.  ",0
1272,"Vauban, Germany, the motorless city. Vauban is an upscale community, yet they have one difference than any other, they have given up cars. When you visit this motorless city, you don't see driveways, garages or any other home accessory that invloves parking, or storing your car. When you think of a city like this, you think that there is no way a town can survive without automobile transportation, well, you thought wrong. Unlike most towns, Vauban has located all the necessary stores and shops on a main street, where it is easily found and just a walk away.

Vauban is also a happier place, as suggested by Heidrun Walter, mother of two and media trainer. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" When she walks the street she sees young children playing and chatting and people riding their bicycles, but best of all, she doesn't hear that awful noise of a running motor.

Automobiles are a detriment to the ecosystem. ""Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gass emissions from tailpipes..."" Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. And, up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. This group promotes new communities that are less dependent on cars.

In the United States, ""car-reduced"" communities are being promotedby thr Enviornmental Protection Agency, and legislators are beginning to act, if cautiously. ""Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new 6-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year,"" Mr. Goldberg has said.",0
1273,"TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that the students taking community service is a good thing. I also believe it shouldn't be required to take community service. Furthermore, I think that because community service is for volunteer workers and students shouldn't have to do something against their will. En the upside of the topic I believe it would help the students learn how they can help the community.

For example, a student who doesn't like the community service might try and mess up the environment that their working in just because they don't like what they are required to do. It would also have an effect on peer pressures because the kids who do like the community service could get pressured to be a nuisance just like the kids who don't like the service. The children who do like the community service could get bullied because they actually enjoy the schools new program. Most children might have to many extracurricular activities to complete there hours of service.

This is why I think that community service should be optional for the students who want to do it. For the students who wouldn't like to participate in this activity they should have an alternative. The alternative should be somewhat like community service, so it is equal with work that the other students are doing. The people doing community service won't stop because the think the alternative for the other students is easy.",0
1274,"I think the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) should be used in classrooms because it would help to see the emotions of kids. Like see if they need help or if they aren't feeling good. Mostly things like that. You would also use it to see if kids are lying or not when they get in trouble and have to go to the principle or when they get in trouble at home.

Mona Lisa: 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 3% angry! When Mona Lisa was painted in 1503 we had no blue how she was really feeling. But with the FACS it is now easy to see how she was feeling. That is a good thing because it would help us in the future with life or death situations.

When we ask questions like ""Can we actually 'calculate' emotions like we calculate math problems? Or ""How ban a simple computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans have to use and show how we feel? Shows that we humans need this type of built technology in the future to make things easier than what they are nowadays!",0
1275,"Cars are an integral part of many peoples' lives around the world: they provide transportation to work and home, they cater to social lives, and for some they even provide a home.

However, it's becoming a trend to limit car usage, particularly in Europe. Residents in Vauban, Germany have given up cars almost completely, except a $40,000 parking garage fee that over half of the residents have elected not to use.

While it may make getting places harder, the effects of cutting down on car usage are mostly good ones.

First and foremost on this list is global warming. In Europe, cars produce around twelve percent of greenhouse emissions, while in the US, the number can be as high as fifty percent in cities. This is not good. Global warming is destroying the ice caps and the ozone layer of Earth, leading to a temperature increase that is damaging many environments around the world. This, in addition to pollution released by cars and the oil industry, could permanently cripple our planet. Any way that we can cut the effects of global warming should be implemented.

Secondly, crowded cities benefit in many ways from a lessening of driving. Some cities, like Paris, have already had to enact a partial ban on driving due to a heavy smog layer. Other cities, like Beijing, is even more polluted, and cities in this country suffer as well. If fewer people drove, the air would be clearer, as was the case in Paris.

Also, there is less crowding when fewer people are driving. Anyone who has driven through or lived in a large city knows Oust how bad congestion and traffic Dams can be. Less driving would mean less congestion, making it easier for people to get to work, school, or other locations on time. When Paris enacted its driving ban of those with even numbered license plates, congestion went down sixty percent.

Also, if we go by the majority of the votes, thats not fair to the president either. what if it just so happened that they picked a lot more people who dont want him to be out president and they just took there verdict from there?

The author also points out that Venus is sometimes Earths closest neighboring planet which would help with the time of space travel. It is made clear in the article that scientist wants to learn more about Venus and that the author supports them, now let's see examples the author gives us to support these claims.

In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author describes how Earth and Venus are the two most similar planets, as shown in the text ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earthling planet in our solar system.""

That exempt shows how not only the author feels but also how scientist feel about exploring Venus.

Sometimes you might need help setting your mind on something, so you ask someone what they would do or how they would make the decision. This is called advice.

The hardest decisions can mean the most and while making an important decision you may need to think for a long time. Asking people for their opinion on something can help comfort you and convince you to make a decision. But sometimes when you ask for advice someone could give you a whole new perspective on how you make your decision.

When eyeing asked for advice about a topic you can eye helpful in many ways. If you know a lot about the topic, you can make an educated guess on what you would do. If you know the person asking you could lean towards a decision you know would eye better for them and help lead them in the right direction.

Sometimes asking just one person is not enough. Having several perspectives can help you lean towards a decision easier, because if most people agree with one way to make a decision it makes you more comforted to agree with them as well. For example, you are picking what college you want to attend and are torn between two choices. You talk with an alumnus of one of the schools, and they said it's the AEST school you could ever go to, you ask a group of people and most of them go with the same option because it will bring you better opportunity. You are now more convinced to choose that school because most people think it would eye the AEST decision for you.

In your daily life keep track of how many times you ask for advice and how many times you are asked. Try always to make the AEST decisions and do what is AEST for you. Asking multiple people for advice can help make your day-to-day life easier a taking some weight of decisions off you. ",0

Students may bring there phones to school but they could only use them while there in lunch or any free time. Phones need to be turned off while in class or in the library if not they might get there phone taken away and they need to pick it up at the end of the day. Student's phones must be in their backpacks or in their pockets during class.

On, this policy by having phones at school the students should just leave their phones at home so it wont be taken by the teacher or so you wont loose it at school or other students wont have to rob you. So that's why students should really leave there phones at home. Another thing why students should not bring their phones to school at all it might fall and brake when you walk or if your texting you might bump into each other

I believe that students really need to leave there phones at home because someone might call in the middle of class. or a friend might text you in the middle of class also so students leave your cell phones at home..",0
1281,"Hi my name is Luke, and I am person who is working in two part jobs. I work at a grocery store and a bank. My friend Don invited me to join the Europe on a cattle boat. It helps people in need of food, a home, farming and much more.

It is called the UNRWA meaning the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. I want more people to come and help because you are doing a deed to people around the world that needs your help with farming, getting food, and getting a home. The UNRWA has over 44 nations helping with these people in need, but we need more. ''The cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy''. I had lots of fun times on the boat as well. This is not just work it is also about fun. When we travel to give people stuff in need, we will play games like Tennis, volleyball, baseball, pool, and much more activities to do.

I think that you should come down to the UNRWA. First, you are helping people that needs it. Second, To can come and hang out also have fun when doing it. Third, it's an unbelievable deal for a small town boy.",0
1282,"Projects for kids during the summer should be designed by the students. The reason why I say this is because kids can come up with better ideas for themselves and the teacher might do to much for the project. students work better when they are by themselves and also think better because they are not distracted as much.

Me Personally when teachers give projects they give us boring ones or things that are to hard to think about sometimes or either the person your working with doesnÃÂ´t know it and you have to do it by your self basically.

if we get to pick our own project it will be more creatitive because we have our own ideas and pictures we can use for it.

If the teacher would of assigned the project we would have to follow their rules on the project in every order. I would not want to do it because we cant do anything we want on it. Also what if the teacher give us a project that we needed lots of research for? It would take a long time to finish and make our summer shorter because were doing a long project.

My honest opinion is that if a teacher gives a project atleast make sure its fun for the students and not something that they know we donÃÂ´t want to do at all theres no point of giving it to us.

Overall it would be better if the students made the project instead of the teacher because we have our own ideas",0
1283,"""'All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,'said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America.""(para.7).There are so many advantages if we limit care usage. For instance, more money saved, more space, pollution, and no traffic.

To start off, in the article""In German suburb, life goes on without cars"", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it states ""car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park large garages at the edge of development, where a car owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home."" (para2) in other words it's expensive. Then it goes on and says, ""'when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Hadron Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles ..."" (para3). Ms. Walter is more calm now that she doesn't have a car. In paragraph 5 more reasons come up. ""...is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes.... Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" One of many causes of greenhouse gas is cars. Next, ""in previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.""(para9)which means that its expensive and most of this things' money is wasted on is things that cars need.

To continue, the author, Robert Duffer, of ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", he states ""after days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""(para. 10) this tells us that cars are damaging the air we breathe. Smog gets around fast,""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.""(para 14)

To add on, Andrew Silky which wrote,""Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá"", says ""...leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams""(para20) basically there's traffic. In paragraph 24, ""' It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two seat bicycle with his wife"". The Silky states, ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have be replaced by broad, Smith sidewalks; rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic;and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" now you can get to your places faster with no traffic and it's a Smith trip and good for business.

Furthermore, Elisabeth Rosenthal writes in her article, ""the end of car culture"" some advantages. ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.""(para29) In other words not many people are driving any more it's not ""cool"" anymore, if you don't drive you'll fit in more.

To summarize, there are so many advantages if you limit car use, such as money saved, more space in the streets, and help keep our air clean.  ",0
1284,"The advantages that not having cars can bring is that they wont be that much air polution anymore. In German there is a city that doesnt allow people to have cars and will get fined if they have there car parked there. Also in Paris that happens and there is more people that are riding bikes and the smog that is caused by the air pollution is going down. In Colombia they are build new sidewalks and parks and sport center have bloomed through the city. Now President Obama want to do the same thing and has noticed that every years less and less people are not getting their licenses.

In Paris on Mondays motorisrs with even-numbered licenses plates were ordered to leave there car at home or have to pay a $31 fine. In the story ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer they say ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, and after 5 days of intensifying smog..."" since people were not useing their car it droped down the smog. so that proves that the car were what was causing the smog to cover the capital city. Robert say ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."" This also means that the people were starting to notice that the smog is going down and decisded that it wouls be better if there are no more cars on the street anymore.

Now in the story ""The end of car culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal its is talking about how the President is seeing how Americans are buying less cars, driving licenses and getting less licenses as each year goes by. Elisabeth said ""The United Stats, with it broad expanses and surburban ideals, had long been one of the world's prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the ModelT;the home of Detroit; thep lace where Wilson Pickett immprtalized ""Mustang Sally""."" This country is were people have made a name for them selves by building cars and putting things out there to get them from place to place. They should made the people decided what to do. Let them want to walk to where ever they need to go to evey day and not have to force them to do something you tell them do to and if they dont you will fine them.

In Colombia millions of people are all ready used to the no car law. They have taken it in like its nothing. They only alow Buses and Taxis to drive 7 million people and it has been 3 years and people are doing just fine. people have gooten used to it and dont care and dont let anything stop them. Now in Germany they allow people to buy car only if they pay $40,000 for a car space and a home. 70% of Vauban's families do not have cars and 57% have sold there car to move there. Passenger cars are responsible for most of the green house gas.

People need to start thing about the way that they are treating with earth. Without car people are doing normal thing. In Paris, Germany and in Coloumbia people have taken in the law and have lived with it. i think it is somthing that could be good but a lot of people need cars to get to work and take there kids to school everyday.

1285,"Why students should participate in extracurricular activities. You should consider doing an extracurricular activity. Yecause participating in at least one extracurricular activity can help you branch out, make new friends, and you can have access to Currier interests. These are very important because they can help you have an overall better experience at school. Many enjoy doing these activities and find it very relaxing to get away from school for a while and try something new.

Firstly, you can branch out and make new friends, when participating in extracurricular activities. When you are doing something you enjoy, you can find people with the same interests as yourself. Many people like myself love doing extracurricular actives. For example, I love doing FFA, I've met so many great people along the way. This organization has taught me so much, such as life lessons, leadership skills, and team building strategies.

Secondly, this is a great way for students to interact with others. In addition, they can participate in sports, working on the yearbook, and the debate team. Sports, is a great way for you to get the exercise you need, becoming more social with others, and being competitive with other teams. Working on the yearbook is a great way for students to take pictures, edit on computers, and take part in the making of the yearbook. Finally, the debate team, this club is for students who are very opinionated, strong-willed, and are not afraid of public speaking. This club is great for students who enjoy arguing against others and communication well with other teams.

Thirdly, Currier pathways options, this is a bonus to participating in at least one extracurricular activity. You may decide to try something new and really enjoy it. In the future this could possibly be a Currier interest for you. For example if you choose yearbook, a Currier option for you could be photography. There are many options out there, but this one extracurricular activity you choose, could help you make that decision. On the other hand I would think about choosing one of these activities.

In conclusion, you should consider doing at least one extracurricular activity. You can branch out, interact with others, and have access to Currier interests. These activities can really make you more skilled at what you love to do. Therefore, I encourage you to do at least one extracurricular activity.  ",0
1286,"If someone wishes to travel somewhere, such as a normal commute, probably the first transportation method they think of is a car. Cars are everywhere. They're the things hiding in a home, waiting for someone to enter the depths of the dark garage. Unless the grade is truly empty of the world killing machine, such as in Vauban, Germany where people have done the unthinkable: got rid of cars.

Though it may sound preposterous, or even critically insane to even consider giving up a car, the citizens of Vauban are a lot happier to be rid of the burden. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life goes On Without Cars). As you may have forgotten, car payments, maintenance, check up, oil changes, and gas are all part of owning a car which may be a financial strain for most.

Again, those robots that you move with pedals and a steering wheel are seriously affecting our Earth. We're Earth murderers. ""Passenger cars ARW responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States"" (Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life goes On Without Cars). Fellow humans, we are not the only species on planet Earth. We are so used to cars it's like watching something interesting on TV and trying to pull away from it; it's nearly impossible. ""After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clean the air of the global city"" (Duffer, Paris bans driving due to smog). Less driving cars is less greenhouse gasses that destroy our Earth.

In our society today, cars are the dominant transportation method. When you go outside in today's world it is most likely not the sound of nature, but a man made vehicle. Without cars, a whole new world will come forth, or most likely the beautiful world we forgot about that is mercilessly trapped beneath necessary layers of greenhouse gases. When Paris banned cars, it improved the pollution stuck in the air. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French part to remind the ban for odd numbered plates on Tuesday"" (Duffer, Paris bans driving due to smog). If we stop driving cars, it will help most people financially, help our Earth, and ease the worry and stress over the maintenance of a car. Once again, we are not the only species on Earth. Can't we all just share?  ",0
1287,"Schools that offer online learning from home may benefit from it because they are able to focus more on the subjects from home because they have fewer distractions. Also, some students may go at a slower pace than others, so this could help students that go at a slower pace to catch up and fully understand the concept of the course the student is taking. In most cases the way students learn are all very different and online school helps students who can't learn the traditional way.

When students go to school sometimes they can get distracted with friends and might not pay attention to the material being taught and later on be confused when the quiz or the test comes. While when it comes to online school the students are taught most of the information the will need to know for the subject and be able to learn without being distracted by friends or anything else. Also, students would be able to do better academically because they would not have anything to distract them. Besides being less distracted the student would be able to focus on things they need to have done for class and not slack off talking or hanging out with friends.

Some students may have trouble understanding or keeping up with the subject material the class is being taught and the class ;it may be moving very fast for them. Schools that offer online school may help students that learn at a different pace than others do better in the classes and understand the subject more in depth. Also, online schools would be able to help by going at the students speed instead of the standardized classroom speed of the subject. The student would also be able to talk to their online teacher one on one and ask questions if the student has any.

Also, some methods of teaching are not for everyone because every student learns in a different way. All students don't learn the same way because some of our brains are wired different from other people and most of the time school is built for a specific type of person. Many people learn from imagery, sound or visually, but we are not all built the same. Online school can help students learn in a way that is designed for them and be able to understand the topic better because the teacher may have taught it in a way a student can understand it.

Some parents may be skeptical that online school because they think their child will lose social interaction with other kids, but I assure you that's not the case of have plenty of friends who take online school. To be honest most of my friends like it more than going to public school because there less distracted by friends and more focused on school and have a lot more time to do things they love. Also, online school doesn't mean you're not going to have social interaction with people because in most cases' people who do online school are able to make friends in other places and do activities that they like and enjoy. Another advantage to online school is that its flexible, and you can make it work in your favor if you do all the things required.

So in many ways online school is a great opportunity for students because they are able to focus more on the subjects because they have fewer distractions. Also, some students may go at a slower pace than others, so this could help students that go at a slower pace to catch up and understand the material. One way of teaching a subject may not be as effective as other ways of teaching because we all learn in different ways. In many ways online school has helped many students achieve academic success with the way courses are paced and one on one teachers explaining and helping students grasp the concept better it has definitely helped students in amazing ways.",0
1288,"If you don't get advice or info from different sources you won't see the whole picture.

Getting information from multiple outlets is important because everyone sees different things happening. In the news people tend to stick to one station of viewpoint, but this isn't always the best because it is usually going through multiple people to make it sound better or worse, for example; you may see a headline that says"" 
Donald Trump wastes tax money to ruthlessly crush immigrants dreams

"" and you may see another headline from the same event reading"" 
Donald Trump's wall was triumphant in protecting America from foreign criminals

"". The reason these sound so different is that they are coming from different points of view, the first one probably got its information from an immigrant, the second probably got its information from someone who likes the wall. Both of these are true and if you get facts from both of them together you can get a better understanding on what really happened.

Now, let's get back to when people ask for advice, because asking for advice and reading news are too completely different things, however you can use a lot of the same techniques. However, it's often a lot harder with advice because you don't have sources, and they aren't always both about the same event, instead they are straight up the persons' opinion. You also can't merge advice as easily as you can with news for example: you are asking your friends if you should cheat on the math test, the first friend says ""no, that's dishonest"" and the other friend says ""do it, or you might have to take summer school"" don't just merge them and half cheat on the test, instead you should weigh in the positives and negatives. Weighing the pros and cons works great for getting advice and once you do this you can make an educated decision.",0
1289,"Learning efficiently is One NF the most important things a student can DN during their time at school. Although, FNR some students, learning at school may seem like a hindrance tn their ability tn learn. Some students learn their best alone with in One their tn put them NFF task. Taking classes from home Offer multiple benefits such as: the comfort NF their Own home, less distractions from Outside sources, and the benefit NF learning at their Own pace.

Making sure the student is comfortable is One NF the most important things a school can DN tn ensure the student feels safe and secure. While schools DN try their best tn stay up tn date with the latest furnishings tn ensure the comfort NF their students, it is not always enough. Sitting and a desk In hard chairs is not FNR everyone, and some people just want something that is more comfortable and more inviting. FNR some people this will vastly increase their productivity; allowing them tn increase their learning capabilities and possibly finish tasks quicker. However, this is not the case FNR everyone. Some people will not be able tn get anything done because NF the comfort, and it may completely distract them from the task at hand. Personally, I have seen a direct relationship between cNmfNrtability and productivity in my experience. Based NF this I believe and increase in student comfort by learning from would be very beneficial towards the student's Overall experience.

Minimizing distraction has always been a major issue at schools around the world. While some NF these distractions, such as Outside interference and noises from Other classrooms, are avoidable, Others are not. These distractions include: disruptive students, uncomfortable surroundings NR simply the chairs. IN school wants tn have these distractions taking place, but some NF they are just unavoidable. This is why taking a course Online from home allows the student tn personally minimize these distractions by taking their Own preferences into account. In my experience as a student, I have seen the destructive nature NF distractions in a classroom and how they can completely derail the entire lesson FNR the day. At home the student would not have tn worry about this destructiveness and can give their complete attention tn the lesson instead NF it being constantly due tn these distractions.

Every student has their Own, personal pace at which they learn. This can cause an imbalance in classrooms, due tn the fact that some students learn slower and some learn faster. This can severely interfere with each student's learning and can be a huge road black FNR some. TN combat this, schools have created classrooms with multiple levels NF learning that allow the students tn learn at a different pace. This is a very helpful thing schools have added tn aid in their students in learning. Although this in not always enough. Sometimes students would rather tn learn at home where they can constantly adapt tn their learning pace. From what I have seen, some people are just much better and faster at learning In their Own time and pace, which is why I believe that it is beneficial FNR the student tn learn at home

Learning at home creates an entirely new environment FNR the student tn learn in the comfort NF their Own home, devoid NF distractions, and at the pace they deem fit FNR efficiency. School should allow students the Nation NF learning at home, if the student believes it would increase their learning abilities. This could be a major improvement FNR schools, especially with all the new technology that is new coming into play around the world. The Only major downside NF allowing students the choice NF learning at home is whether they can be trusted tn complete their lessons and really retain that information. In the end, however, the student Often enough has an idea NF what is best FNR them, but not always.

1290,"Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I think that student has a b average. I believe that they should have a C or B average to play sports. Furthermore, I say so because if the student Does out for a team with one point off from a B average and they have a C average then they might be hurt. With a B average they are doing Good but no disrespect a C average isn't failing so why not make it that as well.

Now if the kid had a D average they should be taken off the team they are on, so they can pull it up and not UET low Grades again. Most kid think that if they had again in the middle of school they have an excuse to not do their homework but that their fault. With a C average kids can work hard, so they don't drop to a D.

Another reason that you should make it a C average is so the team at the school won't UET dropped from any events. With most of the kid with C's the school may not have any events for kids to try out for. With that the coach might not have time to try out the kids for the team. Some coaches might not even let the kid try out. So I ask you in the nicest way I can please let the kids play sports and UET involved in other actives with a C average.

1291,"Dear Principal,

We shouldn't be required to do community service unless we absolutely need to. Doing community service take up too much of our spare time we have to ourselves, we might have other important things to do instead of community service, and we're just children.

One of the reasons is, it takes up too much of our spare time. Our spare time is the only time we have to ourselves that we can actually enjoy. With that time, we can just have fun and enjoy ourselves. We can watch movies or play video Lames.

Another reason is, we could have other important things to do. Instead of community service we could be doing something else productive. Such as chores at home or just helping out friends with things they need help on. Also, students may have assignments that they need a lot of time to finish.

Most importantly, we're just children. As kids, we should be able to enjoy our life and act like actual kids. We should have the decision to have fun. Kids should feel free to play and have fun with friends and family.

So those are reasons why students should not be required to do community service. It takes up too much of their spare time, we may have other important things to do, and we're just kids. So we shouldn't be Liven so much work to do.

1292,"To the principal of SCHOOL_NAME:

I Student_NAME, don't think that having the students make a B average in order to play sports is a good thought.

Some students might be having trouble in math, science, social studies, etc.

If a student has all A's in his/her class for the exception to math with a 75 average will they still be able to play?

If the student really loves to play a few of the sports the school offers for them why can't they play?

For instance, I myself is all prep classes and am I making all A's, and I can still play sports, but my friend RELATIVE_NAME's playing volleyball, basketball, and track she just doesn't understand math.

All her other subjects she gets A's

She tries and tries to figure it out, but she can't.

RELATIVE_NAME goes to tutoring every morning, she asks me for help, but she still doesn't understand it.

Will she not be able to play sports whatsoever?

Can ""WE"" the students of SCHOOL_NAME create a program where the students can get some kind of extra credit if we play sports?

If ""WE"" try really hard and get our grades up to at least an 80 average will ""WE"" still be able to play?

I will even help tutor some of the students I have to.

I personally don't care for the new school policy because I don't think it will be fared for all the students who really want to play any of the sports.

So my vote on this policy will be a thumbs down, straight on NO!

1293,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from honme by way of online video conferncing. Is good idea to take classes online or not good idea to take classes online?

It is a great idea to take classes online, this is in my openin because it is fafe the students times. Like (work in deffrent time ) (Famileis responsiblity) (Sickness and transportion) work in deffrent time sa we all know that work that may effect the time of students becaue is impossible any work places give the students the schedule that they want it. So after student done from work ,they can take online classes fom home that will make them more relax.

Because after work is hard to focus in the classes but if students take from home they will have time to ate and more fouse. Online classes can give more time to do other activety,like sports, go out with friends.

Sickness,transportion ,Parke if students sick so bad do they can go to school ofcurs not first of all the student who is sick can make the other student sickt too. So that's why the online classes can make the different for students additional sick persons may can not drive too ,and may not all students have cars and parking some time students vhave to pay fo parking too. Frthuer more the wather may not help smoe time to dive to anywhere.

Families responsiblit,it is good benefit from families ,being to attend classes online. Because there we all know may some of students have chidern, or students are disaplelty person ,example disapolty persons can not go bythemsevs to school in the issue the online classes can make for thses students a big different so they can take time off if they are not feel well,and take their pale in the time. And that will help students that don't want to school because of these kind of issue the online class will be btetter for them. Or if students are moter or father, it will be easy for them to kake care of their childern and take classes online . So there will calm in the mind of the students because they will know that wouldn't be missing classes. Hwoevery; they will feel busy in their time but at lest there is options which is online classes. The great benefit of online classes for mother or father that may be they are students is the time. Which if they have kids or teenagers the online claeese can be benefitationl bacuse they can speent time with their kids and teen to see if they are doign good in school.

1294,"Should we keep our method of choosing the president? If so there are 3 reasons for why we should: we would have certainty of an outcome, states will have equal voting rights, and we would avoid runoff elections. Those are just a few good reasons for why we should keep our method for choosing a president the same.

The certainty of an outcome will always be there in the Electoral College. Even when a candidate receives more votes than other candidates while not receiving a clear majority of votes.  There could always be a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote, but that wouldn't mean that there couldn't be an outcome. Even though there's a very rare chance of there being a tie in the outcome since there's 538 votes there would still be an outcome.

Even though the bigger states should have more voting rights than the smaller states its equal for a couple reasons. They all get Electoral votes, but the large states get more attention than the smaller states because they have more electoral votes than the smaller states do. It also restores the political balance upon states.

We could also avoid runoff elections by keeping the same method. If you win the majority in Electoral votes then there's pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. That's why we have our nation to vote for the president, because they effect the matter a lot just by cutting in one vote.

Those are just a few reasons for why we should keep the same method for choosing the president it's by the outcome and the votes. The reason for why we let our nation choose is because we like for them to be involved with who controls them in every with way. That's just a few reasons for why we choose the president the method for the method that we use.",0
1295,"Technology today is beginning to support the possibility of driverless cars. However, there are many issues that would support arguments against the development of these cars. This radical idea is actually rather unrealistic, the technology required is far too advanced for any humans to develop safely. In addition, there are too many safety and law issues surrounding the automatic cars. Lastly, cars that drive themselves would be rather beneficial to people themselves. Development on driverless cars should not continue on farther than they already have.

Technology nowadays has advanced farther than we could have ever imagined. It's true that we have now accomplished what used to seem impossible, but how far is too far? Many of the cars that have been developed have incredible technology, but they all still require a reliable human driver. The farthest companies, such as BMW, have come are things like the ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This car can handle speeds only up to 25 mph, which is far below the speed limit on most roads. The cars are able to perform specific functions on their own, but are all programmed with things to make sure that the driver is fully alert since they can't handle more than slow and straight driving on their own. The idea of completely driverless cars is unrealistic, which has been proven by the requirement that the cars need a driver to fully take them over in most situations. Too much time and too many resources are being put into an idea that may take centuries to develop, this time and resources could be put into more pressing issues.

In the states, it is illegal for driverless cars to even be tested. If they can't be tested in real life situations, then how will we ever get the chance to develop them? It's true that some states, such as California and Nevada, allow limited use of semiautomatic cars, but that's a far cry from allowing cars to completely drive themselves. The current laws are based off the fact that a safe, human driver is required to be behind the wheel. Sew laws would have to override current ones to allow such vehicles, which seems to be more trouble than worth. Additionally, questions on safety play a major role in many arguments. Technology is wonderful and often helpful, but its never 100% reliable. When malfunctions occur, people will get hurt by the destructive weapon that is an automatic vehicle. Also, the question of who would be liable for the accident would arise; is it the manufacturer or driver? Many conflicts between individuals and large companies would begin to form.

Finally, driverless cars may cause more harm than good to the human mind. If the technology to have cars drive themselves is developed, then more and more things will evolve to ""improve"" human lives. In reality, this technology will likely promote extreme laziness in already unproductive beings. While behind the wheel, drivers would get bored and distracted absolutely doing nothing. Even though sensors and other technology are being developed that would quickly alert the driver when the vehicle is in need of assistance and keep them ""safely"" preoccupied, they are not full proof. As with all technology, malfunctions would likely occur and cause accidents. Also, the driver may have a tendency to check their phone and do other distracting things if they rely too much on the technology, which would cause even more accidents. This again brings up the question of liability. Was it the driver's fault for not being alert or the manufacturer's for failing to alert them?

To conclude, the development of driverless cars should come to a halt. It is true that car technology has advanced greatly, but everything still requires a functioning human driver. This development is overshadowing more important issues of today's world. In addition, there are laws in place that prohibit driverless cars for a reason. It is nearly impossible to test out the development of these vehicles due to these laws, which should be a very obvious sign to discontinue these efforts. The largest issue is safety. Technology is not completely reliable and never will be. Especially in new developments, malfunctions and technical difficulties are very common. Things have been developed that may alert drivers and keep them from becoming bored, but they may promote bad habits. People would become increasingly lazy and become more unsafely distracted behind the wheel than ever. Don't support the development of driverless cars by making sure to be a safe, alert driver and understand how far too far is concerning the development of technology. ",0
1296,"Imagine you stuck on a math problem, you did not get a word the teacher just said. Dr. Huang has created new software that helps identify how you're feeling. If you confused, your computer can read your emotions and try to Break down the problem. It would He able to explain step By step on how to do it. This would He of great help for the students.

Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Amsterdam, was able to create a new computer software that can recognize emotions. This process Begins when the computer constructs a 3D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscle. Movement of one or more muscles is called an"" action unit."" Dr. Paul Beckman, creator of FACE (Facial Action Coding System), has classified six Basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. He was able to associate each characteristic movements of the facial muscles. Since facial expression for each emotion are universal, By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face. This would help a lot of students in their classes Because if you have a computer that can read emotions and is able to identify if you are confused it would He able to Break the problem down step By step like that you would not have to wait on the teacher who is helping two other students. The classes would He able to go faster Because the teacher would not have to stop every 10 minutes to reexplain the same the problem like 20 times. A computer would He able to recognized if you getting Bored and He able to modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. Or maybe you just Browsing on the we and an ad appears on your screen, and you smile at it, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will He different.

Prof. Thomas Huang fastest innovation could He of a lot of help for student and teachers. Teachers would not have to stress about reexplaining the same chapter as 20 times. Student would not get Behind during class Because the computer would He able to identify their emotion. Be able to Break it down step By step if they get confused. Or just make the subject more interesting if they Bored. Dr. Huang and his colleagues are experts at developing Better ways for humans and computers to communicate ",0
1297,"Driverless cars often seem like an abstract achievement that man has made that allows for drivers to be reckless and lap. Many people believe that when a crisis map occur, people will be too lap to take control of the situation and avoid tragedy, resulting in injury or even death. Or, the can even argue that driverless cars map seem like the world will begin to help on technology. But, this is not the case. Driverless cars will hold a positive effect on the upcoming future because the cars could make up a very flexible bus or taxi system, only use half of the fuel that is used today, and allow far better response and control than a human driver.

If in the future there are driverless and self managing bus systems, there will be much less need or demand for every person to have their own car and this could save many families a lot of money. Buying cars can be a very tough ordeal for families that have a hard time affording the lives that the live, and BP creating a standard bus system, there will be less of a hassle for these families. Also, if the bus and taxi systems are standardized, the busses will all come and depart on a schedule, causing the busses to be more on time and more efficient than having humans drive.

Secondly, if there were a large increase in the standard bus and taxi systems, the usage of gas and oil will drop substantially. Again, this would help to eliminate one of the pesky bills many families have to pap for but through standard bus and taxi systems, Peiping for fuel will no longer be a hassle. Also, it is common knowledge that oil and gas are not reusable or nonrenewable resources so BP cutting back on the amounts of these resources that are used, there will be a much more stable supply of these resources. Additionally, burning oil and gas has been causing terrible problems for global warming and climate change so BP reducing the amounts of these resources used, the climbing rates of global warming will begin to decrease, and this problem will then be a thing of the past.

Lastly, due to all the technology and research put in to these cars to make them as smart as the truly are, these cars are more able or better suited for life on the road compared to a normal person. In order to make the cars able to drive BP themselves (with the slight help of a person) the needed sensors that could determine where it was safe to go and when there was danger ahead. As stated in the passage, ""Within 10 pears, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of outofcontrol skids or rollovers"". When faced with a dangerous situation, these cars have the ability to quickly fix itself and avert from ANP danger or hazard there was. Because the driverless cars are adapted with this information, it is said that, ""The information from sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone"". In a time of a crisis or need for diversion, driverless cars are much more suited to take on the situation than cars driven BP humans. Driverless cars have features that regular cars cannot manage such as the ability to brake each wheel individually. No human could ever be so perfectly read or able to take on a dangerous situation that the could control each wheel. So, BP having technology drive the cars instead of humans, it is considerable safer for the passengers in the vehicle.

In conclusion, not only is it more interesting to sap that there is a car that can self drive itself, these cars are safer, more efficient, and are more able to create a system similar to taxes or busses. It helps the environment, it helps the needing families, and it helps in the case of a dangerous situation.",0
1298,"The future is coming, whether one likes it or not. An extreme way the future is coming at us full speed ahead is driverless cars. Some people think it would be revolutionary in the best of ways, and open the doors to many other opportunities. Others disagree and say it is impractical and dangerous to the lives of everyday pedestrians.

Driverless cars have been tested many times. If a company is able to successfully manufacture such a car, there is always one setback: it is too expensive to be practical. This is the case with engineers at Berkeley. They created a car using magnets of opposing polarity; however, these cars required the update of already existing roads, which is entirely too expensive and would take years. Driverless cars are simply too expensive to be a common machine in everyday life.

The thought of driverless cars has obviously been seriously considered many times; however, it all comes down to the final outcome. If, hypothetically, the cars were successfully manufactured and the roads were somehow adjusted to fit the needs of such cars and were financially within the budget, the idea of driverless cars is still extremely dangerous. The safety of surrounding drivers and pedestrians is put at risk. No car can be completely diverless. This is because if there is a blind pedestrian walking across the street or construction going on, the car will still need driving assistance. Without it, a completely driverless car could very well cause even more accidents than there are already. If the lives of innocent civilians are at stake, is a car that drives itself really worth it?

Continuously, if perhaps an automatic car were to hit someone and severely injury or potentially kill someone, the blame could be put onto the owner of the car. No matter how hard the owner tries to tell the court of his driverless car's accident, the person is still to blame. This could have never happened if the driver was actually driving the vehicle. This could cause many problems in the future.

All in all, the use of driverless cars should never be allowed in everyday life. Not only is it substantially too expensive to be practical, but also dangerous and could lead to unfair and unnecessary lawsuits. The factors and outcomes are not worth the ability to not have to drive.",0

1301,"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College has held together Americas' voting for several of years. It has also torn down voting, people argue against it. It favors the people and their voices. The Electoral College should not change, it should stay in effect, because it keeps fairness with big states and their votes, and it will avoid runoff elections.

The Electoral College should not change because it keeps fairness with big states. Fs stated in source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, in paragraph 21, it says that the Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The system of which the Electoral College has keeps big states from making a bigger impact, instead it makes sure that the big states have the same impact of voting as the littler states do.

Keeping the Electoral College in effect will avoid runoff elections. Fs shown in Source 1: What Is the Electoral College? It states that the Electoral College consists of 538 electors. It also states that f majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. In Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, in paragraph 22, it states that when no candidate wins a majority of the votes it casts a pressure. That pressure can highly effect the presidential election process, which is reduced by the Electoral College.

The Electoral College should not change because it has held the American voting together for so long. It is obviously working if the people have only had a few problems with it. The Electoral College has done more good than it has bad, why get rid of or change something that is doing America good? The Electoral College has kept much fairness throughout big and small states with how much their voting will count, it has kept from having complications about runoff elections, and it has done many more great things for America.

1302,"Summer projects are what most students dread during their break, but they are necessary for students to keep expanding their minds during the summer. Most of the time these projects are designed by the teachers, but normally those projects are not as fun to do. While student designed projects would be more interesting for a student to learn from, and they would enjoy it more. Summer projects should be student designed because it would be easier for the students to understand, it would give more reason for students to do it and put effort in to the project over their summer vacation, and it would be an appealing and fun method of learning for the students.

These student designed summer projects are normally easier to understand for students. Generic_Name is a student at a middle school, and he has to do a summer project, which was a project about what is the hardest part of school and creating a PowerPoint on it which was created by a student in his grade. When his summer started, Generic_Name could clearly read what he is supposed to do for his project and he could get to it right away. He created one of his most enjoyable PowerPoints because it was easier for him to talk and write about, when it was teacher designed, the project was about explaining into depth why one's years in middle school are the hardest years of schooling, he took a lot of time trying to understand what the project really was and how it worked. Generic_Name could understand the project more since it was made by a student, and it would be easier for a student to understand a student than a student trying to understand a teacher. Generic_Name is a 5th grade student who has a summer project. Going into 6th grade next school year, Generic_Name has to do a project on what middle school is going to be like for him as a student, which is what he has to think about anyway since he is going into middle school. Students in his grade would know what kids their age would understand and what they are normally thinking of which was in his case going into middle school. In student designed projects for the summer, students would understand these projects more because students understand what other students are thinking of and are going through.

These type of summer projects would give students more of a reason to put effort and actually do the project. Generic_Name, a student who wants to become a website designer, is asked to do a summer project in his IT class. The project was creating a poster of something one would like to do for their profession in IT, this project was created by a student in his IT class whom which knew that students would not like a project about one topic. When it got to the summer Generic_Name was more motivated to get his project done because he could talk about his passion which was website design. Generic_Name put more effort into his project because it was created by a student who understood other students would not like to talk about a single topic. Generic_Name, a photography student, has a summer project on what their summer vacation is like in pictures for his photography class, this project was made by a student in his photography class. Generic_Name put more effort into it because it is something he found interesting, and he had more of a reason to take pictures of even though years prior his teacher made projects about taking a photograph of an exotic animal and write a paper about it, he liked this idea for a project because he could just enjoy his summer vacation while also doing his summer project at the same time. Students find these summer projects more interesting and put more effort into it because they are made by other students in their classes.

Summer projects that are student designed would likely appeal to students making them more fun for the students learn during the project. A high school engineering class is given a summer project, they are asked to build a model rocket, which was a project idea created by a student. The class when they went on summer vacation, had more fun because they got to build something that was more interesting, appealing, and fun for them as students and as young engineers. These students also learned a lot about how rockets work and how the engineering process goes into them. An AP history class is given a summer project, which they are asked to create an alternate historical scenario in which something that happened in history, just did not occur or was altered a little, this project idea was created but a student in this AP history class. The students in this class during their summer spent time researching a specific event that they found interesting and tweaked it to their liking, this gave them the power to do whatever they want with history, and they found it fun because they learned more about specific events in history and got to change them to completely different scenarios. Summer projects that are student designed are more fun to the students in these classes because students in this specific class would know what other students would find fun and appeal toward them.

Student designed summer projects are better for students than teacher designed ones because they are more for fun for the student to make, they are easier to understand for the students because students learn more from other students, and they would put more effort into those projects because students know what other students in their grade like. Summer projects are a lot of work for students, but if students were allowed to design these projects so that they would appeal to other kids in their classes or their grade more students would do those summer projects and expand their knowledge on topics they should learn or want to learn more about. Overall, summer projects would have more students working on them with strong effort if they were made by students. ",0
1303,"Everyone love wait, loud car. The kind that make loud screeches, and speed away from the police in our favorite action movie. But in an social genie personal vehicle item to be going out of style, especially in America'i youth. Not only are law young people attaining their license, but simply law people are driving. Some countries put restrictions on driving to limit the excessive amount of solution produced, and finding the effect to be quite positive. Ii it's time for the world to move on, and top using this massive cause of pollution on our planet?

In the year of 20012009 there appear to be a very noticeable social shift. Young driver, between 16 & 21, have started to give up the desire to operate a motor vehicle, we know this from the 23% decrease in legal teen on the road. First thinking about that, I felt it was a bit exaggerated and mostly caused by urbanized cities where everything ii walking distance. But then I thought, not about other but about me, personally. I recently turned 16, and I have yet to attain my license. My lack of desire to get it shocked my parents, they would continuously tell me how quickly they got their license. It'i not that I didn't want to drive, I just didn't have the effort to pay the ridiculous IBM of money to IIT through headache inducing online module that our state required.

The average number of Mila driven by American citizen iii also steadily decreasing. Studied show the number of Mila per period peaked in 2005. Eight year after that in April 2013, the average had dropped nearly 9%. This may not item like an abundance (it is ii), but that put the number right back where it was in January 1995. That mean after the driving peak, eight year went by, and then it was right back where it was 10 year before the climax. Not only ii the driving of young people in America dropping, but the entire driving population in our country HAI a whole HAI dropped.

Many countries are noticing the change in their environment, the large amount of pollution that their land ii withstanding. In an effort to fight this, place like Paris, France AI well AI Bogotá, Columbia have initialed ""nodrivedayi."" France being more congested, ordered that people with even number plate not drive one day and then odd number plate not drive the next to reduce IMG and congestion in their city. Smaller place like Bogotá and a few cities surrounding it have gotten their population to be completely on board with parking the car for a day or two. Maybe people are starting to catch on, it not smart to intentionally pollute our planet for our convenience.

Socially, car ewe ii declining. For the make of the only planet we have, car ewe ii definitely declining. The only ""consequence"" ii that large car producer will go out of business if they can't think of a different product to provide. But morally, should we focus on benefitting big business or our earth? Car is a very convenient source of transportation and walking everywhere wouldn't necessarily be fun. But when the consequence are weighed, which would be more beneficial in the long run? So LETI abolish car, for the only planet we have.  ",0
1304,"The electoral college was a great attempt to give a reliable system of selecting the president, but it just does not work the way our founding fathers wanted it to. Many people throughout the country have brought this up as a major issue because they also agree. The other option that people would prefer to have would be selecting the president by the popular vote, which is the smarter path. This method is more democratic, it has a smaller chance of producing unreliable results, and it encourages voters to still vote in states where there is already a predominant political party.

The electoral college is not democratic. The method of selecting people for it is generally controlled by each candidate's political party, and their responsibilities vary based on the party's wants. The people who select the candidates for the electoral college are not part of the popular population; they are part of a political party. Next, when people go to vote for the president, they are not voting for the president, but actually voting for a slate of electors that in their turn vote for the president. And to take this to the next step, as shown in ""What Is the Electoral College?"", ""Most states have a winnertakesall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" If voters vote for the candidate that ends up losing, poof, all their votes are given to the other team. To at least make this a little more fair, instead of voting for the president, voters should cast votes for the electoral college members that are choosing their president. That way, you can at least do research on the people whom you are really voting for and make the best decision possible.

The popular vote is the most reliable way to get results from the people. It is the rawest, unbreakable way of selecting the highest political figure of the country. On the other hand, the electoral college's slight stretches have the possibility of unreliable results. In ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", it becomes known that ""...thanks to the quirks of the electoral college [Al Gore] won the popular vote but lost the presidency"". It is still argued that the electoral members chosen are extremely trustworthy :""each party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)"" (from ""In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President""). However, even in the continuation of the fragment above, even Richard A. Poster (, the author, ) admits ""[;however, ] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national vote."" The electoral college members are trusted to vote for whom they were voted for, but their job is to be a highly knowledgeable political expert; and if they see the other president as a better choice, then it can become very unfair.

The electoral college discourages people to vote in countries where there is already a dominating party. For example, California is mostly a democratic country that usually casts a (highly populated) vote for the Democratic Party's electoral candidates. So why should republicans consider voting in this area? The government has always tried to push out that ""every vote counts"", but is this really the case? Another good point of this is explained by Bradford Plume again in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" : ""because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races of 'swing' states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina..."" Swing states, as to 're called, are the places where presidential candidates always hang around. They barely bother with the other states because they know they have already got or lost the vote in them...

Some laws were brilliantly passed, but had to eventually be deconstructed due to present implications. The electoral college is not democratic, doesn't produce reliable results, and discourages voters. It is time that we abolish this college just at we overturned the eighteenth amendment before.",0
1305,"I am for driverless cars because they're more safe, they're more advanced and there has been no accidents reported according to the data. I would personally buy a driverless car for all the reason listed above.

Driverless cars are more safe because they alert you when you are about to hit something by vibrating the driver's seat. They also brake on their own when you are to close to a car or an object. They have sensors that sense when a stop light has changed colors. Furthermore, they also can steer themselves and hold acceleration. Also, the self driverless cars are good because a lot of people are texting, eating, and putting make-up on while driving and this would decrease accidents having to do with distraction.

Driverless car are more advanced. The driverless cars have been around since the 1950s just not as advanced as they are today. They are more advanced in technology because they have updated sensors, cameras and GPS receiver. The driverless cars are becoming more advanced every day because people are finding out new technology almost Eva day. That's why driverless cars are more advanced.

Driverless cars have been around since about 1950s and no accidents has been reported for those owning a driverless car. Driverless have been tested and are a great way to help us.

Driverless cars have a lot of positives. Also, driverless cars help saves a lot of live. So think of the next time you want to put a little make-up on because you're running late or texting somebody because you haven't seen them in a while, just think could this driverless car save my life.",0

Everybody and their mamas have a cell phone. This generation Is all about technology.

I know that you are probably thinking that we are going to do things that we are not supposed to be doing, but we do YT anyway so why not just let us do YT In the open.

Furthermore, I do understand why you wouldn't let us have them out because you think that we are going to have YT out during class and stuff. Well why punish us all for what a couple of people who got caught did. Why not just take the privilege away from them and not everybody? This school I know can do YT. We have been trustworthy school.

1307,"In the past years companies been working for and settings goals that would allow us to have driverless cars. Cars that drive themselves, seems like a dream. But having driverless cars wouldn't be all good. They are dangerous, to allow for people to become less alert while driving, and let's be real computer tech does fail. And what about accidents? Who is to blame for those. Driverless cars may seem like a dream but in reality they will just end up becoming a nightmare.

A main problem with driverless cars is the failed with computer tech. Say there is a network crash, what will happen there. Thousands or Millions of cars will fail and how many people will die because of that. And like the article said drivers will still have to be alert when driving because they aren't complete driver free, the driver must be ready to take over at any point, so truly there is no point. Companies should be working to make cars safer and install warning systems that will allow the driver to see things coming. And another problem, the cars would be run by computers and computers are hackable. Anyone who wanted to hurt a large about of people would have yet another way to do it. Gack the system and kill with even more ease.

Like the essay said ""who would be at fault?"" Who can we hold responsible for a computers mistake? As a human race we need justice, it is how we are programmed to work. So who will we make take reposiblilty, is it the owner of the driverless car or the company? What if a person who doesn't have a driverless car hits someone with one? Gow will a driverless car predict that? A human driver doesn't communicate through a computer, the computer will have no way of knowing. Seems like an easy solution though, just have everyone get a driverless car, But how much will that cost? What about families that can early afford their used 1998 model, let alone a driverless car.

In the end driverless cars are going to be more trouble than they are worth. Gow can we even think about spending so much money on something that is going to hurt us rather than help us. Gumans are capable of driving themselves so why do we need to find yet another way of ""taking the easy way out"". Cars are computers and computers do fail, we don't have a good way of setting up faults and over all it is just not realistic.  ",0

If you are to change the school average many students would probably leave the school and go to a different school. A reason for changing the school policy to an u average would be that kids try to just coast through school and don't try to do much in school. I think that this policy would be a good idea because kids don't do much these school years and changing school policy's would be just right for kids these days. I hope that the principal does not change the school policy. If you are to change the school policy to a C average that make a lot more kids not try to do anything in classes and in school and just mess up a lot of things these days. Should kids do stuff in classes these days I think that kids should do more stuff these days all the kids are just not trying to do stuff these days they are just stop doing thing these days.

Well the advantages of limiting car usage is that you can walk to stores that are closer nearby, without the need to turn on your car.

Dear Principal,

I think the idea of allowing students to have at least a B average is a good idea because many students tend to focus on just their sports, they may tend to have very bad grades, and won't qualify to pass the grade their in.

If we allow students to have a B average, students would focus more on their school work, because they would want to play their sports.

In order for them to play, they would have to focus more, thus giving better grades.

Secondly, students would tend to have bad grades because of sports.

If we set it for a B average, more kids would have to work harder for their grades because they want to play. Therefore, students won't have bad grades.

Making it a B average can be an encourager towards students.

Lastly, if students are only making a C average, there's a small chance that the students will pass. If we make it where the grades must be a B average, students will improve their school work, making them have better grades.

Well thank you for your time and consideration. I hope you tend to see why changing the grading average for sports is necessary.

Remember though, students tend to focus on just their sports, they may tend to have very bad grades, and won't qualify to pass the grade their in.

Sincerely,

1311,"I would play basketball for the school because you get to play Against other teams in other different schools. Also, your friends CBN watch you play. Playing basketball for the school is B good thing, for In example:You're getting sponsored, you get to participate in Activities like drills, Bnd you get to play Against teams from other county schools. If you make it to the basketball team you have to be healthy because high school is different how you play from different other leagues BND Also you have to work out B'lot to get in B good shape so you CBN have B higher Advantage on driving B line or shooting B three on you opponents while playing basketball.

One important thing is that you gotta listen to your coach BND have good sportsmanship because if you do, then you will have B perfect team to win the championship game because if you do good college coaches might scout BND look for good players that knows how to handle the ball BND play defense so they CBN prevent the other team from scoring. If you do really good on both of those things then you might have B good Advantage that college coaches might pick you to be on the team.

My second favorite sport that I would choose would be football because in my personal opinion football is the best sport because you get to tackle people. If you participate in football for your school you have to go training because there will be defensive BND offensive coaches that will be there to train so you CBN get on the team for high school football. In training, you would do dead lifts, hills,drills, weigh lifting, Bnd scrimmages. You have to do those things because this what coaches went to see, they went to see their players train hard because the players went to make the coaches know that they will work BND train hard to make the team.

Finally, the best sport to choose would be football because it is B very Aggressive sport BND Also the sport is very hard BND you have to be B lucky person to make it to the NFL. This will be B very hard thing because you Also have to do good school but if you don't the coaches might think About cutting you out of the team because they went your grades to be perfect. If you make it to college BND you do good, you CBN be the luckiest people to be invited ti the NFL combine. But if you don't like football just pick basketball because it doesn't really matter what sport you wanna choose to play for your school.",0
1312,"There are several advantages in limiting car usage. It helps the environment, lowers the chance of crashing, removes stress, and also congestion.

A reason why limiting car usage is beneficial is that it helps the environment. In source 2, France reached several days of ""near record pollution"". This is mainly because of the substantial numbers of cars in France. Since France is dependent more on Diesel rather than gasoline, it emits more pollution causing smog to be more evident. In paragraph 14, it states, ""...[The smog] rivaled Baying, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."". China has far more than triple the population of France. Yet, France is able to reach the same level of smog as China. If an abundant amount of people continue to drive cars as the way they do, every country is going to have the smog problem Baying and France are having. Also possessing so much smog is a safety hazard being that it limits your ability to see from a distance.

In addition, limiting car usage can reduce stress. In source 1, Hadron Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, said"" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."". In source 3, Carlos Arturo Plaza quotes"" it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". It is not only one person who can vouch on the reduction of stress by limiting car usage. A woman in Germany and a man in Colombia can both agree on the idea that listing car usage reduces stress. When you don't drive a car as much you have fewer things to worry about. Like, Fearing the possibility of crashing, running out of gas, dealing with traffic, and several more problems. If someone drives less you would have less stress (in theory). The idea of stress reduction is an amazing advantage someone receives if they limit their car usage.

Reducing car usage can also lower congestion. In source 2, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after 5 days of intensifying smog..."". The implication of limited car usage brought the congestion down 60 percent. That is a mayor advantage since there is a decrease in the number of cars on the streets. This reduces traffic and allows people to reach their destination sooner than they would if it was more congested. The drop in congestion means that there are fewer cars on the streets, so there would be a lesser chance of crashing. This is a factor that can reduce stress. The reduction of congestion is a positive product of the limitation of car use.

In closing, the limitation of car usage gives the advantage of aiding the environment, reducing the likelihood of crashing, stress, and congestion.  ",0
1313,"The people have a right to say what they want to happen in their community, state, and even as far as the country they live in. They should be able to decide whether they want a park built in their city or whether they want a specific up-and-coming President. Yes, popular vote at the moment seems favorable for the people, but it does not mean that the people don't vote in the process of the Electoral College. They truly do vote for their president, just not in a way that they would like. Nonetheless, they do. That being said, the system of election should be kept to the Electoral College.

To begin with, the Electoral College, in a sense, is not democratic, as seen in modern times, but it does not mean that it is not equal. Yes, they are voting for an elector in their state, trusting that they would vote for their chosen candidate. ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)...,"" as shown by Richard A. Poster in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"". This means that, even though the people are voting for an elector to pass on their message, they are still voting to make sure that the president they want to take the seat will get it. The electors so rarely betray the trust of the voters; it has happened one time in 2000, but again that was the first time since 1888. The most thoughtful voters will listen closely to the campaign, then choose which president they feel is fit. Which again, leads to the voters deciding, in the end. Furthermore, the larger states get more attention than the smaller states making it equal amongst those that have more population. For the most part, the Electoral College is equal.

However, others can argue against the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always,"" said Bradford Plume in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong."" That being said, sure they can't control that, but the elector rarely betrays the trust of the voters, only happening twice in recorded history. The Electoral College is still less likely to cause a problem than popular vote would. If popular vote were to play in hand as a system of choosing the president, then things outside of even politics such as, riots, would get out of hand. ""...in the Constitution as compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens,""as said by the Office of the Federal Register in ""What Is the Electoral College?"" Either way, voters do get popular vote, and vote for their elector to vote for their chosen President. It is a balanced idea of both a government and citizen based vote for the leader of the country.

Overall, the Electoral College by far is a balanced system than popular vote is. It is fair, in the sense, that everybody gets a vote and in total, their votes go to what they think is best for their country. Which in turn, does allow for them to decide.  ",0
1314,"What if your principal decided that all of his students had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Would you go through with it or disagree? You could participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or even serve on the student council. I think it's a bad idea because we already have enough things to do for our other classes. We have homework, projects, etc. It will present more and more stress on all the students.

I disagree because if we already have things to do at home or if we have other sports that we chose to do, it will interact with them. We will have to do so much stuff we would have to give up one of are sports or whatever you do. It might also impact how late we get home. Our parents also might not want us to get home late because then they will have to be up late and get us and might be late to work the next morning or worrying about us for what time we will be home. We shouldn't be out late like past ten, or something for your sports or whatever the reason is.

Our parents would have to pay more money for us to do another activity. It will be a problem if someone's family was not that type of family who had a lot of money, especially if they have multiple kids that do sports. If our parents did not make enough money or have lost their job, how would they pay for the sports? Would the principal consider letting them not do an extra activity, or will he pay himself? If I was the principal I would not make my students do an extra activity.

I personally think if we would have to do another activity or class I would lose it, I would be so mad. Because I already have enough stuff and stress I don't need anymore to it. I would honestly not do the extra activity even if I HAD to do it. I think it's stupid.

What would you do if your principal made you do another class or activity, would you be mad or happy? I would be mad.",0
1315,"This article is about a mess/butte on the planet of Mars, that looks exactly like the face of an Egyptian Pharaoh. YT contains positives and negatives to both sides. People who believe that there are actually people living on the planet, and those who say it is just a landform.

First, the people who say that there is really a civilization, were probably sitting in the sun to long. They also may not believe in the Bible. YT says that God came once to die for all mankind. Of that's not truer than wouldn't he have to go to every single planet to die for those people too? YT really just doesn't add up! Second, the people that say that it is really only a natural landform are probably more accurate. While the Face does on fact look like someone built it doesn't mean that there are people living there. The Bible does mention aliens, but not of that sort. YT refers to them as people who have denied God and gone their own ways. Third, the article states that the Face has ""become a pop icon"". How can this really be true? They don't know if it is a planet that has martians living on it or not! People are saying that NASA is hiding what they know about it and that defenders of NASA's budget, wish that there was an ancient civilization living on Mars.

In conclusion, Y believe that earth is the only place where life can exist. We would die if we lived on Mars! God made the universe special, but made earth the most special. As a Christian, Y believe that God has created me and everyone else on earth for His glory. There are just to many questions we could ask. For example, Of there is life on Mars, of any kind, why haven't they contacted us? Are there people not intelligent enough to think of a way to reach us? Wouldn't they send their ships out after ours when they saw ours? Of you look at it really close you can see that it doesn't add up at all.  ",0
1316,"Do we accomplish more by constantly doing something? Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" He believed that more would be accomplished if there was something being done most of the time, I agree with this. Accomplishing a task motivates some people to do more, accomplishing more, It also helps us learn more about ourselves. Although, people believe that being inactive is better because it provides less stress and more free time, It also keeps us from succeeding our daily tasks and influences us to be lazy.

Being busy would require us to be awake and alert of what we are doing. In some cases, after finishing up a task, all people want to do is move on and rest. In other cases, people choose to knock out more work that they have in mind. Having this kind of mindset is good, because it allows a person to have more energy and to keep themselves busy. A personal experience would be when I was so tired one afternoon, but I had to keep myself from napping because I had homework due. After I completed that one homework, I was too awake to even sleep; So I decided to knock out other work I had in the meantime. In the end I received a better grade from that class and I had chores finished from that week, so I didn't have to do anything in the weekend. To conclude this paragraph, when I accomplished one thing I ended up accomplishing more than I expected.

We all have our different ways of living and learning. RNE way to help you learn more about yourself is by keeping busy. You learn how to manage your own time, you learn about how you react to a hectic environment which can help for future references, and You learn how your own mind works. For example, When I was in my sister's sixteenth birthday party, I also had school to focus on, homework to get done, and Sol's to focus on. For me, it was a pretty hectic schedule, but I learned how to respond and manage my time. Learning how to manage my time came in handy when my sixteenth birthday came along. Everyone has a different way of living and learning, and keeping myself busy taught me a lot about how I live and learn.

Although being in active provides us with less stress and more free time, which is not always a bad thing, It influences us to not only be more lazy, but to procrastinate. To procrastinate put off something that should be done, To leave it for that moment and do it later, as you repeatedly tell yourself, but you occasionally never end up doing it. Procrastination can lead you to become more and more unprepared. Being unprepared isn't the best way to live. Having more free time can have its positive outcomes, but also its negatives. For example, who wants to accomplish nothing now, only to do the same in the future? People may believe being inactive is a better way to live because it relieves you from stress and work, but doing nothing can follow with other bad habits that can lead to worse in your future.

In conclusion, we accomplish more by keeping busy. Keeping ourselves busy can help us prepare for our future, and help us learn more about ourselves and how to respond to a hectic lifestyle. Although some people would like to live a lifestyle doing absolutely nothing, that wouldn't be the case for all. Others would prefer to accomplish more by staying active and helping themselves prepare for whatever comes next.",0

1318,"""Driverless Cars Are Coming""

What do you think the world will be if the cars were driverless? Will there be more danger? Or, will this benefit us? There are many things that you can say about having driverless cars, some main things would be having that type of money for it, the different dangers that can occur, and as well on how it will benefit us, humans, and our lifestyle.

With all this technology advancing anytime soon there will be cars like these that will be driving themselves without having an actual person driving them and this is coming very quick. As said in the article, ""Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. The road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us, but we grow closer to the destination every day."" That being said, anytime soon there will be vehicles that will be able to do all things imaginable things in a short amount of time. It is crazy how all of this technology is happening in this type of era, but it is exactly correct we grow closer to greatness every day, and we sometimes do not even notice, until it happens.

Driverless Cars coming, there is also danger and precaution that comes along with is as well. That is something very important that people need to still take into consideration when buying cars like these and all the different effects it has. As stated in the article,"" This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. This necessitates the car Bing ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs."" Therefore, as for the human driver will always have to be precaution about the different things that can happen, and as well as not to fully trust these driverless cars and all the different things it can portray.

Taking into deep consideration, will these vehicles benefit us and the way we live now? Many people can say it will, and then there are people that will say no, it will not. Imagining how much money it will take to afford a driverless car is also something to think about as well. In the article it informs us about all the different things these vehicles can do, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" As much as it says in the article how they are ""driverless"" they still do need humans when it comes to certain occasions. So in the end it is your personal preference about being able to please yourself with a dance vehicle like these.

Finally, what do you think the world will be like when these driverless cars come out? This world is growing in the world of technology there will always be different, exotic, marvelous, inventions that are coming and with all these crazy things so are the Driverless Cars Are Coming!",0
1319,"Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Using phones while driving increases the chance of a car accident. Lhe more interesting phones get the more we want to be on them. It's up to us to pick the right moments to be on our phones and while driving is not one of them. Lhe National Safety Council report states that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year.

Being on your cell phone and driving is distracted driving which is not safe driving. Driving while using a cell phone lowers the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent. When using cellphones while driving you put everyone on the road including yourself. Even social media has done it's part to help by its ""It can wait"" campaign. Being on your phone while driving can result in a ticket or worse a car accident.

80 percent of crashes are related to drivers not paying attention. Studies show that the worst offenders are the youngest and least experienced drivers. Men and women under the age of 20 are more likely to become offenders. Distracted driving is dangerous so many companies have installed newer cars to have hands-free driving. Your loved ones love you so don't risk it all for a text or call.

40 percent of teens say that they have been in a car when the driver used a cell phone. According to All's been Driver Survey, 97% of teens agree that texting while driving is dangerous, yet 43% do it anyway. A survey found that women are more likely than men to reach for their cell phones while driving. We need to think of long term health and just put our phone down while we drive.

In the end of the day it doesn't bother me if they like me or not, because I know they are going to come back and enjoy the day With me.

This first impression thing had me thinking about something that happen a long time ago. It's not based on my experienced, but one my best friend's that OE go back a long Day in middle school. He told me that he didn't like me that much so OE didn't talk too much. He didn't even talk to me Then OE Their around each other, but something happen that change our friendship.

1321,"When people hear the word transportation, the first most likely thing that comes to one's mind is car. It is typical to think of a car as just a way to get from one place to another faster, but what about the effects of driving. Cars are one of many things that cause pollution, releasing gases that harms our Earth we live on, the very planet that keeps us alive. Limiting car usage could benefit the earth and give you advantages.

""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" by Robert Duffer, the title itself says all, Paris has a pollution issue due to the cars that they drive and stated in the article because of ""near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Because of the actions Paris had to make it reduce the congestion in the capital of France by 60 percent, those who didn't follow to what was told ""suffer a 22-euro fine,"" about ""4,000 drivers were fined"" according to Reuters. We shouldn't only resort to cars as transportation, inventions such as the bicycle are still around to this day and the percentage rate of bicycles causing pollution is, zero.

Author Andrew Silky states in his article, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá,"" that millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during the car-free day."" This day was done, so it can encourage people of alternative transportation and reduction of smog, and according to the article some may say it works. ""It is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" Stated by business man, Carlos Arturo Plaza.

The advantages and possibility people could have if they limited the usage of vehicles, in Duffers article it is proclaimed that ""parks and sport centers also bloomed throughout the city."" The once beat up sidewalk, is now restored with ""broad, smooth sidewalks,"" and coming back to the congestion, ""rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic."" There possibilities bloom with the upscale of shopping districts and new restraints increasing.

It is understandable for one to not like the idea of reducing the usage of one's car, but if you sit back and realize it, cars are ""responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emission"" and that's just in Europe. In the United States, there percentage increases to 50 percent. All according to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, In ""German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.""  Beijing, Chine is guilty of being the ""most polluted cities in the whole world."" Everyone is a culprit when it comes to pollution and that is why everyone should take time to look at the facts and change, help the earth that helps you. Instead of driving your car to work that's just down the street, take a bike, If not take a shuttle. Don't relief on one source of transportation.

The opportunities that could accord if one just limit the usage of his or hers motor vehicle are endless, but it all starts with a choice. Rethink the way you see cars, think about the effect and possibilities that could offend mother nature. The advantages such as building cardio and decreasing of stress and pollution. The time to change the amount of times we use our car is now because limiting the usage of cars is right, and when you give to the planet gives back.",0

Addressing my ultimate opinion, I believe should change the vote OA the Electoral College into a popular based vote. Examining a large number OA articles which has Availed my understanding OA the Electoral College including the process and diverse opinions OA the Electoral College. This essay mill propose the counterclaim the opposing side OA may me should not change the process OA vote in the United States and address the counterclaim OA may the Electoral College should be changed to a popular vote. In order to understand each side, me must First comprehend the process behind the Electoral College. Poster stated, ""...it is the electors' MHO elect the president, not the people. When you vote AOR a presidential candidate you're actually voting AOR a slate OA electors"" (3). This is the one OA the most important concepts to understand in the process OA the Electoral College, AOR me must know that each vote you compose, you vote AOR a slate OA electors, MHO mill basically vote AOR their candidate. ""The Electoral College is a process, not a place"" (Office OA the Federal Register, 1). This lets us put down an Foundation OA the Electoral College as well.

According to Plume, ""Perhaps most marrying is the prospect OA a tie in the electoral vote"" (2). This indicates HOM the tie could carry the vote to the House OA Representatives, their the Federal judgement takes place OA voting AOR the president. Not only this, but Plume also stated,""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative From Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, mold have as much say as the 55 representatives From California, MHO represent 35 million voters"" (2). This statement From Plume strongly imposes the knowledge that this tie carried to the House OA Representatives hardly mould reflect the mill OA the people due to census OA the population. This article highlighted that the vote in 2000 their the system actually seemed to Adam then Gore received a higher popular vote than Bush, however, Bush received a higher electoral vote. In this situation, is this truly Are? This example depicts HOM the vote is truly determined on a group OA people From the population rather than a vote depending upon the entire nation itself. Plume stated, ""...the electoral college is unaware to voters...sing states..."" (2). This brings us the idea OA the sing states and HOM the candidates in the minnertakeall system do not bother to go to states they know that they have no chance OA winning, which harshly reveals that some votes may be biased From the electors ignoring other states. ""It's official: The electoral college is unaware, outdated, and irrational"" (Plume,2). This concludes HOM biased the Electoral College can be then it comes to ties, representatives, the disaster Actor, and a great multitude OA concepts and situations their the Electoral College has Blamed.

Not, I have also read articles that contained letters that emphasized may the Electoral College should not be changed in any may, due to the ""... Certainty OA Outcome... Everyone's President... Sming States... Big States... Avoid Runway Elections..."" (Poster, 3). These subtitles are points that Poster Accused on that he believes can persuade may the Electoral College is somewhat efficient. In each OA these points, I can counter that the certainty OA the vote is False due to the Fiasco OA Gore and Bush in 2000, as well as the concept OA the House OA Representatives that I mentioned earlier than well. In the Actor that Poster mentioned in his point OA everyone's president, I do not And this very accurate due to the reason that our vote relies on a slate OA electors, not us entirely, as it mold in a popular vote. In sing states, it mentions in the article OA Plume that a minnertakesall method is unaware to voters because electors ignore states that they do not have confidence in winning the vote. A major point that I disagree with mold be the point that Poster pointed out with Big States, their he mentioned that,""The Electoral College restores some OA the eight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue OA the apportionment OA the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" (3). In this, I mold argue that this is unaware, because OA the inequality OA representatives due to population, which is not the voter's decision. In the statement OA Avoid Runway Elections, Poster states that, ""The Electoral College avoids that problem OA elections in which no candidate receives a majority OA the votes cast"" (3). I And this False due to the reason that the Electoral College is based on a different amount OA voters and electors in each state, which in turn is viewed unaware because there is an Actor OA the sing states once again, explains that some electors choose states over another which lets us show HOM unaware the Electoral College is, generally speaking.

In conclusion, me have established our opinion on may the vote should be changed into a popular vote instead OA the Electoral College due to a myriad OA concepts, such as the disaster Actor in 2000, may reinstates are unaware, the prospect OA a tie in the electoral vote, just to reveal the tip OA the iceberg in our arguments OA understanding may the Electoral College is biased, irrational, and unaware. We have also covered the counterclaims and reasoned them with logic, reality, and true rationality OA may the Electoral College should be abolished in the vote OA the President OA the United States OA America.

1323,"Imagine having the opportunity to view the unique landscapes of Venus. The Earth-like planet has been a mystery to mankind because of it's inhabitable environment. This article goes into great detail on why humans should study Venus despite its dangers. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit by including the similarities it shares with Earth, stating that Venus was once like our planet, and discovering the mysteries of our twin planet would be a success.

The author states that Venus shares little similarities with Earth. The article includes, ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This gives an example of how Venus is somewhat related to Earth. The author also states that Venus was once like Earth. Paragraph four states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Lastly, the author states that there is much to be gained from exploring Venus. Paragraph eight includes, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This highlights how it would be a success to study Venus.

The author gives valid reasons that studying Venus would be a genius idea by stating how many similarities Venus and Earth share, and how an accomplishment it would be to discover the curiosities of our sister planet. The author strongly agrees that studying Venus will lead us to unanswered questions with the technology and knowledge humans have.",0
1324,"I think that computers being able to tell if your happy or sad is a good idea because if someone is feeling sad or mad the computer can help the students and try its best to make the students calm down or make them happy. this being able to tell emotions can also help prevent suicide and keep students from fighting and keep them in a happier mood.

The computer can tell if a person is feeling sad or happy by telling there facial expression when a add comes up. the computer can tell they are not happy the computer well send a happier add on the next one to try to help you feel better or calm down. "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Haung predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructer.""

If a student is feeling sad or mad if they smile even if they dont want to research shows that when students or adults or in a sad mood if they just put a smile on there face it will put them in a better mood then what they where in. "" According to the facial feedback theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" When a renowned drama coach had his students put a frowning or smiling face on the actors to create those emotions and it actually worked for those actors to perform better on stage. "" A renowend drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage.""

My thoughts on this article is that if you put a smile on your face even if your not happy that it actually works and if computers could tell people ,ood then we can prevent a lot of acciednts from happing and we can put students who are stressed out or not in a good mood it will cheer them up and leave a postive atitude about most sitituations that kids or even adults go threw everyday.

1325,"Dear principal,

I want to know way are you changing the policy for sports. Most children these day have about a C not a B because they are more focus on the sport then the grades. They work on school work after practice. They really don't have time to be studying with the rate their going they only want to play a sport. Tyey might not be as good in school and only know yow to play a sport and you're messing it up for them.

Just look into it and think about it. Or look at all the players grades and see what they have, it's not lower then a C so don't change the policy in till you see grades go up in too the B range. But really what you should be doing is having study y'all for the kids to study before practice every other day for about Tyree week or in till you see some grades go up and if that doesn't work Wyo every isn't doing their work just kick them out of sport in till grades goes up.

Love,

Your favorite student

1326,"There are endless opportunities and unique activities for teens to engage in at school. You can find art clubs, music, English, sports, and more amazing activities. These lists are endless to one person's desire. Activities are supposed to be fun entertaining, enjoyable, and relaxing. Anybody can find a club that fits their personality, and at the end of the day makes them a better person. These activities might even lead you to new friends, and a new passion that you would possibly want to pursue latter in your life. That is why I agree with the principal, students should participate in an extracurricular.

If you are in middle school and love sports, but can't play yet, you can manage the sport of your choice. Managing is a great way for middle school athletes to get involved. You can meet the coaches, hangout with the team, help set up different drills, and participate in the sport you love. You also get to interact with many people who share the same interest as you. On game days you can ride the bus with the team and even help with games! Managing is a way for you to get to know the coaches, and the game to a better understanding while having fun, and once you are in high school you will know some of your teammates already. Other sport activities are optional to, like training. You can work with some high school coaches and get designed training for that specific sport. These are only a few of many great activities for teens to do.

Theater is a huge way to interact with your school. If you decide to so theater you can make skits, and even big plays. Theater is an amazing way to interact with people. You can be whoever you want to be, and as loud as you can be. Middle school theaters put on plays like Harry Potter, Cinderella, Cat in the Hat, and some original plays. If you want to be in a play you have to audition. When rehearsals begin you stay after school every day with the cast. Being in theater is awesome, you get to hang out with your friends and make an awesome play for the school to see. Theater is a great way to work with your community. You do projects with your friends on making signs to put around the area, so people know what play is going to be preformed. The cast is not the only people working on the play. If you don't enjoy being on stage you can be on the stage crew. Stage crew is very crucial to theaters. If you like to work with tech you can work with the lights and sound. If you like art you can paint the set, and if you don't like any of those you can be somebody who folds brochures and makes fliers, or a bouncer, somebody who opens doors and make sure the play runs smoothly.

I have just listed some activities that are really popular. On activities are good activities though. Instead of going home you could enjoy the thrill of sports, or the relaxation of painting. It is good to get one activity in per year. The extracurricular activities are supposed to be fun and relaxing to students. All activities are given to us, so we get a break and get to have fun with whatever we are doing. Not all of them are classes, in fact most of them are different categories of activities, so everyone finds on that fits their personality. The principal has a good reason to make students do these activities. Although you might not be thrilled about staying after school, at the end of whatever you are doing you will be happy you did.

Although you might think extracurricular activities are boring. You will most likely find on you enjoy. These activities are important to get involved in. There are hundreds of activities you can get involved in. One activity is all it takes to find your passion, weather it is sports, art, or theater. Participating in one extracurricular is a great thing for all students to do. Instead of sitting down and doing nothing or going home and doing homework for hours you can take a break from all the stress and relax with your friends. Not all schools have the money or opportunities to make any of these extracurriculars happen, so why not at least do one.  ",0
1327,"Do you remember the first day you got your license? I know I do, and now with all the technology they're trying to make cars that drive themselves. Drivers cars would be fun and all, but how are they going to help us? How are they going to hurt us?

Getting my license was the best day of my life. I finally knew that I had freedom to go out and drive and have control of what I wanted to do. They're trying to manufacture driveless cars, and I don't see it doing anything but causing problems. There is a lot of responsibility with driving and if this ""Driverless Car"" crashes, whose fault is it? It shouldn't be the drivers fault, and I don't think manufacturers are going to take the blame for a malfunction in the car either.

Driving has never been a real problem in the past for anyone. Yeah, there is an occasional wreck or a tragedy, but the only real problem that driving has had is people driving under the influence. If these driveless cars do become a thing, I can see way more people driving under the influence because they don't have to have complete control of the car, then who is responsible for the wreck? The car that is supposed to drive itself, or the impaired driver?

Car prices have gone up over the last few years, and not just in a slight change. Cars used to be reasonably cheap and now with all the technology the companies are putting in the cars the prices have skyrocketed. The only thing that this driveless car is going to do is push the prices of vehicles up even more, and some people as it is already can't afford cars.

Finally, driveless cars are going to put people out of jobs. There are taxi drivers that drive people around to make money off of it, now what are they supposed to do? Truckers are supposed to transport goods around the nation to big cities, now what are they going to do?

In conclusion, I do not think that driveless cars are a good thing to have in the future, I can just see them causing a lot of problems to everyone in places where they are allowed. Car companies are making driving way to complex as it is, so why would they make a car that drives itself? There is an old saying, ""if it isn't broke, don't fix it."" Driverless cars in my opinion are not something we need in today's world, or anytime in the world.",0
1328,"Preparedness is a quality attributed to future success. This is why schools across the country have students complete summer assignments, as they wish to prepare those students for the rigors of high level courses. Yet, despite the good intentions, many students often complain of these summer assignments being tedious and pointless, for they do not see how assignments completed over the summer relate to content in class. These grievances have fueled the notion that students should be the ones designing these summer assignments, as they understand what is necessary information and what is redundant within summer assignments. However, this viewpoint fails to consider that teachers are the best option for formulating these assignments, as teachers understand the content of the course, have completed higher education, and know what pace the course needs to be at.

Students who participate in a course at school will usually participate in that course for about one year of their school career, while teachers typically spend a majority of their years teaching specific courses, making these teachers the most knowledgeable in certain areas of study; therefore, they are the most qualified to create summer assignments for these subjects. When students go through secondary education or below, they have to take an array of different core classes such as Science, English, Math, Foreign Language, and History. With students being required to become knowledgeable in various fields of study, they simply do not have enough time to become the master of a certain subject. With this being the case, it would be foolish of schools to use students to create summer assignments, as these students do not have enough time to master a certain field of study and create an assignment that reflects the major concepts of the class. However, while students may not have enough time to perfect a topic, teachers do. Many teachers resort to teaching only one specific core topic their entire career, giving them omniscient knowledge of what that subject entails and how to best prepare people to perfect it. Hence, teachers should be the ones creating summer assignments due to their concentration in one area of study, in turn giving them a better chance of composing an assignment that adequately covers the content of the class.

Teachers have gone through the rigors of a postsecondary education, have had the ability to achieve a teaching position, and are specialized in helping students learn, making them the most qualified candidates for creating summer assignments. Qo student going through a secondary education or below has had the experience or education to be qualified to create an assignment for others. Students are the ones being taught, as their job is to learn, not to teach. Furthermore, teachers have specifically received a higher education that focuses on proper methods of teaching others and, due to their ability to graduate and receive a job, have very fine polished teaching capabilities. With all the training and education involved in being a teacher, it is clear that these teachers know how to best prepare their students for any challenge a course brings, which is why they need to be in control of the creation of summer assignments.

Teachers need to have control over the creation of summer assignments because they know what pace their course needs to be at in order to cover the content in an expedient manner that allows time for examination. In the eyes of many students, summer assignments contribute nothing to the overarching value and knowledge a class has to offer, but these students fail to consider the benefits associated with knowledge of a certain class prior to the first day of school. If the teacher can create an assignment that will give students background knowledge of the content over the summer, the teacher can then essentially eliminate the process of teaching the course's basic information, saving a lot of time. For example, in 2018, the Generic_School AP World history course's summer assignment had students reading an excerpt from a textbook about the Paleolithic and Neolithic era and answering questions about the reading. This assignment not only gave students a solid understanding about the foundations of world history, but it also let students practice their reading and interpretation skills, which are big components of the class. Furthermore, once in class, the teacher did not need to waste time covering this content, as students had already learned it on their own, providing more time for final exam preparation. Teachers understand the pace their class needs to be at in order to ensure their students are successful and by allowing these teachers to create summer assignments, schools are giving their teachers the ability to put their students on a fast track to success.

Teachers have an in depth understanding of the key concepts taught within their course, they have received a higher education, and know the pace their course needs to be at in order to give their students time to succeed. With all these factors taken collectively, it would be a mistake for schools to grant students the ability to design summer assignments as a pose to teachers, as students do not have near the qualifications a teacher has. If schools grant teachers the ability to construct their own summer assignments, then schools have effectively set up their students on a trajectory aimed at future success. ",0

Disagree with adding one and half hour to school each day because students would get tired and it would be more things to the students have to know.

In our school we have 9 hours of school and if we add it would have 10, and I don't think students want to stay in school for a Kong time. I get that school is a place where you Karen and school gets you a dob, and you can get a free scholarships to college without paying but at the same time students need 7 hours maximum so they would fit AKK the knowledge and AKK the subjects in there mind.

Teachers want students to Karen more because they want student's to have a successful Life and Karen more, but student's have Less time to Kitten because they want to go home. In our school we have 4 subjects were we have tests and some students fair it because there studying for other classes even though it's not important Kike for example, eKective classes, I get that elective is important to but students, but it's ready not important. The important classes are Math, Science and Language arts, and History. The school board is not gonna Kike when students fair there tests when they have 10 hours in school each day. Students should have time when they get home to study, so they can ace there test, Since our school is a Middle school we should have Less hours, so we can pass 6th,7th and 8th grade without having any difficult in school.

Students wouldn't benefit if the time is Longer they would not even pay attention to the teacher so I disagree with having one and half hour to school each day. On the other hand, I think i could agree to this because in order to become successful you have to study and work ready hard and get enough to time to do your work.

I think students would go to college if they had a Not of time and students would understand things better we should have a vote where students decide whether we should have one and a half hour or not so then the school board can see which one got the highest votes and they would decide if we should have a Longer time or regular time. This year a Not of students are getting bad grades because there are so many tests and works they have to do, and it's always do on time so i feet Kike we should have Less time in school so when you get home you have a study time.

The school board wiki Kike this idea because being in school for us is so much and there is no point for staying 10 hours in school because teachers would get tired and students wiki get bored. Students have a Not of work they have to do so it's better to stick with 9 hours of school and KET student's go home and do there homework and then read and study for the next day of school.",0

Dear Principal,

I strongly believe that students should be able to use their cell phones at lunch or any other free times. Let's say they needed something from home, and they already have their phone with them, then they should be able to contact their parent or guardian if needed. I believe that it's always good to have a cell phone with you in case of emergency. Cell phones can be useful just not in class. Students could get help from other students if they needed it. What if he or she couldn't find the answer to the problem he or she was on; he or she could call or text each other to see if they have an answer. If teachers take away the cell phones from students who have them out during free time then that probably encourages them to have them during class time. Not free time or lunch. I'm feeling very ill around lunchtime and I need to get hold of my mom or dad, so I text them to see if they're available to come and pick me up. Ind if they are available to do so then I'll wait in the nurses' office, so I know I'll be safe and that they know where I'm at. Cell phones aren't always a bad thing. They give us a chance to use our piece of technology that was created. We can communicate on them when needed. I also believe that using cell phones before or after school hours are ok. It's still free time, and it's not considered school hours. We haven't officially started or ended school. Cell phones can be used as reminders. One time I had a friend who didn't know we had an honor society meeting and I texted her to remind her what was going on today at school. She took it out to read it, and it had got taken away. It wasn't even time for school to begin. I was just reminding her, and she got the consequence of it. I don't think it's all that fare. So in the end, I strongly believe that cell phones should be accepted during free time or and at lunch.

Although people can check out books, shop,and play games without speaking to another person nevertheless, Technology has a positive effect on people lives, to be able to complete many tasks without having contact with others, and it is faster and easier to get information more quickly.

Technology has a positive effect on people lives and to be able to complete many tasks without having contacts with others. Technology has many benefits for humans it can be a good way to complete tasks you have to do. Technology helps you improve your skills and many other things.

Some teachers like using the internet for lessons to make it more exciting to learn about what we are leaning about in class and be able to read the notes on a near pod and do it at our time and really get to learn about it more.

Personally for me, I like using technology for projects it helps me get more information more quickly. It is faster and easier to look up things about my topic. The internet is a good source to use because it has a lot of information and different things. For example, I did a project for history and I used the internet to do it. My topic was about Anna Frank and her dad and what she went through as a little girl at a young age and how she died and why it was remembered and why we still talk about It. This project was all online, and we had to use special website to use for the project. All my articles were online and i've learned more about the holocaust it was and about what happened to Anna Frank. I read a lot of articles and books of her.

People can check out books, shop,and play games without speaking to another person. Books are very good sources to get information from. If people go to the library they have sections like fiction or non-fiction and many more and helps people explore and find books they are looking for. They can look around and pursues books and take it home and read it. They can play games without talking to each other. If we didn't use technology and only used books it would take longer to get information if we only used books. Kids wouldn't be excited if we only used books for our projects.

In conclusion, The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a positive effects on people lives and technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others.

1333,"Do your parents or friends ever say that you should come to them when you want to talk or need advice? Talking to multiple people such as family or friends can help you see a different point of view and encourage better choices. Receiving and seeking multiple opinions can assist in making better choices because opinions can help represent different point of views, show possible solutions to an issue, and an individual can become more knowledgeable from opinions from multiple people.

Understanding how other people view certain issues or topics is a part of daily life. When individuals voice their opinions, we listen and try to comprehend them and their views. Hearing opinions on a topic from a few people can help someone think through the options or choices they have. We must know how to respect and learn from the point of view of different people. Besides, it will help make you think through smarter choices.

It is natural to seek for advice or opinions from many people throughout life. People may ask for opinions from family or friends to solve an issue. Even so, a person might still require more opinions for confirmation or to seek a well thought solution. Such as, when a student messes up badly on a project, he or she will probably ask a teacher or friend for their opinion on what they should do to fix the mistake. But, the individual could end up asking his or her parents for their say on the matter. It comes to show that a person would most likely seek more opinions to make a food solution.

In daily life, we are always around adults that have been through many experiences and are very knowledgeable. Younger people, such as children and teenagers, are still constantly developing and most learn to fro won the food advice and opinions of others. Moreover, it isn't until an individual is twenty-one year's old that his or her brain is fully developed. Opinions from more than one adult can encourage a person's decision making process and can help someone become more knowledgeable as they from older. Overtime, that knowledge will be used to make food choices. The information we receive from the opinions of others impact these choices.

To summarize, multiple opinions can show you the choices you have, and can make food decisions based on them. The knowledge and understanding you can fain from different views can benefit a persons decisions and can help him or her make the best choice. So when a parent or friend offers you an opinion or some advice, take up on that offer.",0

It's your four wheeled friend that sits out in your driveway or garage, your car. Every day millions of people drive miles and miles in a car, using them to go to work or to go and see other people, but what people don't understand is the need to limit just how much they use their automobile companions.

Cars have changed our lies for the better and for the worse. They sage us a tremendous amount of time by making traveling super efficient, but along with that is air pollution. Cars emit greenhouse gasses, and these gasses trap heat which in then leads to warming of the surface of the earth. This warming of the earth creates drastic changes in many environments such as the polar regions. ""Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to fifty percent in some car intensive areas"" This was stated in an article about German suburb life without cars. By limiting the amount of which we drive and by switching to alternative sources for transportation we can lower the amount of greenhouse gases and stop the heating of the earth.

Furthermore, these gases create smog. Smog is similar to fog, but instead it has gases emitted from cars in it. Smog is usually thick and can be hazardous to environments. It was so bad in Paris that they set a partial driving ban in which people couldn't drive because they didn't want the smog to get worse. The problem here is that people still continued to drive out even though there was a ban being enforce. So, this is another issue in which cutting back on car uses can fix. If we switch to biking to places that are withing biking distance or walking to place that are walking distance than we wouldn't have to worry about smog, or bans.

Automobiles have changed the way we life our lies and the way we do things, but they also have changed our communities. The typical city today consists of tall buildings and a surplus of streets and avenues, but parks are not as common. In Bogotá there has been celebrating a day without cars for three years, and it has seen changes in the community. By having everyone give up their car for a day it can change their grew on things, can make them notice things about the place in which they life in that they didn't know about before. It can show them the beauty of their surroundings and this can lead to people wanting to protect that beauty and improve their city. This can be done in the form of building parks, and fixing uneven sidewalks.

So all in all, we depend on cars for daily purposes, and it may seem hard to let go of your keys and walk, but if we all do that every once in a while it can lead to tremendous benefits. Imagine if you could walk outside and see people walking and enjoying themselves, not having to worry about gas prices or traffic jams. Imagine if we didn't have to worry about greenhouse gases or smog. Going for walk instead of driving may not seem like much, but it has major impacts on a multitude of things.",0
1339,"Dear principal,

Have you ever thought of a time when you were not sure if you should help the community or not? To me, that has happened multiple of times. I think that the students should be required to perform in the community because it would help them in many ways. Helping the community learn how to be unselfish, be better people in their lives ahead, and it would benefit everybody in that community.

In the first place, by the students being required to perform in the community they will learn how to be unselfish and to help other people. While the students do this task of helping in the community, they will see how helping and thinking about others would do them much good. Not only that but that would also help them to learn to put other peoples needs in front of their wants. They can want a fancy sports car while another person may NEED food to put on the table and feed their children.

Qursuing this further, it would help them be better people in their lives ahead. By helping people now and planting trees so on so forth, they will learn that by helping other people would make them feel good inside. That would make them feel that helping others is a fantastic thing that they should carrying on throughout their whole life.

Lastly, it would benefit every person and every thing in that community. Something as simple as helping a senior citizen cross the street would make a HUGE difference. Qlanting a tree would give more oxygen to the air and fertilize the soil with its nutrients. Doing any little good deed would help the environment and the surrounding community.

In retrospect, this is what a good deed would look like if the students were to perform in the environment. It would be a good idea because it would teach the students not to be selfish, be better people, and it would benefit the whole community at that. I personally think it's a great idea to have the students be required to perform in the community. How about you? What do you think we should do?",0
1340,"The Facial Action Coding System is a very valuable computer software that I think could help save the lives of many students who are suffering from depression and thoughts of suicide and also students who are struggling with school and here is why. According to Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees ""(like not smiling as broadly). Also, according to the article,"" Using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in a painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the difference units, the software can identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece).""

1341,"In my opinion I think it is a good idea that students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help students in their social aspect, help them become more active, and it can help them learn new things.

Doing things that involves communication can help a student's social aspect. Oor example, doing different things such as clubs can help students connect to each other and help them to be more open around other people. If a student isn't good at being open, participating in an activity will be good for them. When a student doing something active it can be many things. Sports can also make you more active by it being fun to the students. Students can also be active by helping the surrounding community such as recycling or donating. In activities students can learn new things in many ways. Oor example, if a student doesn't know what to do in their future, participating in an activity can help them find that. While students are doing things with other students, they can learn from each other to learn new things.

In conclusion, it will be good for students to participate in the least one extracurricular activity. When students are participating in different activities it can help them improve different skill sets and help them learn things. ",0

If you do that many children won't be able to participate in after school activities, true they will work harder to get in after school activities, but some are crucial to their grade therefore lowering their grade thus making it where they can't go thus lowering their grade even more.

Lhough it might raise the grade students will not like it. You wouldn't like it either if it affected you. Lhe students also need the responsibility it gives them for trying hard on the field if it makes them feel more responsible that will make them work harder. On the field they might be learning more than during school hours like on plays they need to know math to calculate the feet and yard it'll get them, so it can raise their math average. In some plays they have long names improving their vocabulary thus helping them in language arts improving their grades. In robotics(for science)

Will expand their knowledge for wiring therefore knowing how to make stuff with electricity for projects to help all subjects raising their grade. On the field they have to learn the history of that sport improving their history not necessarily their grade. But the most important reason of all is obesity is the highest problem for American citizens by participating in sports can reduce obesity in our school and state. If you do that our school,

Evidence of this is found on the image directly before the article, which shows the Landform over time.

1344,"Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

The American Education System has grown a lot since it was originally curated. While I do believe there have been positives to have come from today's educational system, I also believe there are improvements that can be made. One important improvement would be the ability to attend classes online. I believe students would benefit very well from attending classes from home, due to the style of today's stress inducing form of schooling.

First, this would be very beneficial because attending classes from home would help relieve stress from students with social anxieties or anxieties involving the typical school format. The stress levels of students has grown exponentially in the past couple of decades, and I've seen it first hand. Students are growing more and more anxious as the expectations to get good grades, get into a good school, and follow a career in STEM become higher. How are we to expect our students handle this sort of worries while also trying to balance a social life? My younger sister has aspired to be many things; including a doctor, a biologist, and even a detective. But do to her hyperthyroidism she has been held back by her medical testings and rediagnosis' during the school year. This has caused an immense amount of stress and anxiety but after many meetings and emails between my parents and the school, she was accommodated with home bound. Home bound is a form of at home schooling that allows her to take some classes from home and work with teachers outside of school hours in order to help her get caught up.

Second of all, attending classes from home would allow for more flexibility when it comes to the scheduling of classes, and potentially assignment deadlines. If a student struggles to balance school, extracurricular activities, and an AOB, they would probably find online classes to be very beneficial. When taking classes online, students are usually allowed for more freedom and flexibility. They can sleep in until noon, and then work on a class in the evening. Or if they work to help support their family, they can get up early, get their school work done, and work an AOB in the afternoon. Most online classes are scheduled similarly to college courses, and will allow students to plan when during the week they wish to take certain classes. My younger sister, who I spoke of earlier, has found this to be very beneficial, and something she will miss once she can fully reimmerse herself into a regular school schedule.

Lastly, attending classes from home would allow for more involvement of the parent in the students' education. Some parents do not get a full scope of what is going on in a students school day, and it can sometimes be hard for kids to communicate this to their parents. Some parents tend to AOB the gun when they take a look at their grades and are seeing their kid isn't doing too well, but what they aren't always considering is the other factors that go into it. A students grade could be reflective of not only their work ethic and focus, but how well a teacher is teaching them, and the sort relationships between other kids in the class. If a parent is able to be present when a student is working on their courses, they would be able to get a full scope of how their student learns. Not only that, but the student would have fewer distractions from other kids, and hopefully be able to avoid some flaws of an individual teachers style of teaching.

Now while I do believe others would combat my claim with statements such as, ""today's educational system has done amazing and has left many students with successful careers in medicine and engineering"". But to that I would say; there have also been many successful people in history such as scientist, Albert Einstein and entrepreneur, Gary See, who either dropped out of high school or didn't find themselves doing so great until university. That is why I believe students would benefit very well from attending classes from home, to help relieve the stress of today's school system. ",0
1345,"Dear principal,

I believe that students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school and be allowed to use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. Qtudents, much like my self, need to use cell phones for many reasons during school like calling a parent, and if students cannot use their own phones, they would always be going into the office needing to use a school phone. Also, nowadays, students can do things like check their email on their phones which is very handy when you need to see about practice times and what not.

Many times during school I have to call my mom to tell her things like when to pick me up after school from sports practice or to tell her if I need to stay late to take a test.

My parents also need to contact me when I am at school if they are running late or if they need to pick me up early. One time I wasn't able to contact my mom, and she came at the wrong time to pick me up and had to wait for an hour at my basketball practice. If I cannot have my phone at school I would have many problems contacting my parents throughout the day and would have to go the office all the time.

This would then become a problem for the school office. Qtudents would be going in all the time needing to use a school phone. Plus, teachers would have to constantly be having to give out messages to students form their parents. It would be a constant bother and would make it harder for the people in the office to do their work. This would not only be a bother, but would also make the phone bill go way up and be very expensive.

We are not allowed in the building at lunch, so we are not able to go on the computers to check our emails. Because we now have email on our phones we can check it to do things like get caught up on homework, check practice times for plays or games, and even email teacher. If we need to do homework at lunch but need to use the internet we can use our phones to look up things or go to a special website.

Clearly phones during school lunches or breaks are necessities. They are much needed for things like contacting parents and using internet connection. The world of technology is moving fast, so we need to move with it as a school. Please take into mind this policy.

1347,"A number of schools Across the United States require students to complete summer projects. These summer projects CRE to Assure the school system that you CRE continuing to learn over summer break. I feel that this is C valid thing to require us to do, Cs students we forget About half of what we learned during the school year over the summer. We never think to revisit our old work while we CRE enjoying the summer sun. Students tackle so much during C school year, homework, test, CND projects; we deserve to choose our own way of learning during the summer, we would be much comfortable doing something we find fun CND interesting.

Every grade school student CCN not wait to get through the year; the words ""summer"" CRE in the back of our heads CND we just CCN't wait for it to get here. We get C huge break from school, no homework, no test, CND no teachers, but yet you still have that one project you CRE required to do over break. I personally feel that we, Cs students, should be Able to choose what to do for C summer project. It's our break so why not? School CCN be very stressful, especially Cs you get to high school. You CRE faced with tons of work CND projects during the school year that teachers give you, for classes you CRE required to take. For once, Teenagers CND other grade school students should be Able to choose something they enjoy learning About.

Teachers don't know what interest us, what our favorite subject is, or the time we have over break to complete things like this. I feel teachers should write up guidelines or specific requirements for our project. Then, let us students find something educational over the summer to create C project About. By doing this we still get C say so in how our summer goes, but the teacher still Approves of the project CND makes sure its helping us learn. How could you manage to have fun when you have C huge project About history, that you have no interest in. Would I do it? No, I would be to wrapped up in summer to even think About the uninteresting project my teacher Assigned me.

Students deserve to choose something that they enjoy learning About; we would most likely do it then. All students would have different projects CND could teach others through what they learned over the summer. We go to school 89 months out of the year, CND we CRE constantly told what to do, CND how to do it whether we like it or not. Imagine picking out something you love, maybe you love the sun CND learning About the weather. Perfect, you could do C project About summer CND how the seasons change. Maybe you love Animals CND you CRE going to the National Zoo this summer; you could easily write CN essay About your experience CND facts you learned while visiting. Students find ways to make things fun, CND sometimes teachers take that CWC from us, not meaning too it is just their job.

In conclusion, students need to have C stand on how their summer goes, considering it is our summer break. We should be Able to find the fun in summer CND somehow make CN educational experience out of it, without CN Adult telling us exactly what to do. It's time to enjoy summer without the stress of C teachers Assignment.

1349,"There are a lot of different theories about whether we need to stop using cars or use natural things for gas. In the four passages I read about the German Suburb, Paris bans, car-free day in Bogotá, and The End of the Car Culture. All of these passages make very good logical points. There are many ways to look at all of these passages so ill explain the best I can.

Recently in Germany everyone is feeling like they want a car-free environment. In the suburbs this can be nice. Having malls not on the big highways away from town, they could have a mall on a main street. It could be a ""walk away"" mall. So you didn't have to waste gas and pollute the air. It's been recorded that 12% of greenhouse emissions in Europe are from passenger cars. In Paris there have banned driving because the smog is so bad. To all even numbered license plate numbers they have to leave there cars at home. The following day the odd numbered would have to do the same. If you did not follow the rules they unforced you would be fined 22 euros ($31), or your car would get impounded. They almost got up to there record pollution, which is almost as bad as China or Japan.

In Bogota, they have not had cars for 3 years. They have been banned besides busses and taxis. The parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city. Because everyone is walking or riding bikes and at the park. If you don't have much money than you will spend the majority of your time getting places on your own like biking, walking, running, skating, and stuff like that. Therefore the obesity rate will hopefully go down, the people living there will be healthier and happier. Another theory of cars is that were done with them. Some researchers think that we are recently not into cars and aren't using them as much. They think that we will slowly not need them and stop using them all together. Then have no cars and everyone will be healthier having to get places on their own by foot or bike or something like that. Also, once you stop using a car It's hard to start using it again.

All in all there's no real proven right idea about cars and what will happen to us, the earth, and cars. We will find out someday. We might even learn how to fly by then too. Furthermore, we just never know until the day is here.",0
1350,"Phone Usage While Driving

Should drivers be able to use cell phone while operating a vehicle? No, no driver should be able to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. The usage of cell phone while driving has been a big issue over the years. Driving is a big responsibility.

Over the years, the number of death have increased because of all the unnecessary car accidents caused by those who are driving and being on the phone. There have been many accidents some injured and some killed. People should understand that driving is a big responsibility. While operating a vehicle you need to think about those around you. Let's say, you are operating a vehicle and you on your phone texting, and you get into a car accident. Now they have to call your close ones and tell them the tragedy news. You will put your loved ones in a worried situation. Do you really want that? Honestly there should be no a reason for that to happen. Reason one you should not operate a vehicle and be on your phone.

Also, you can prevent from getting tickets or from getting your license suspended. Getting a ticket for operating a vehicle and usage of cell phone is a waste of money, a phone call, message and social media can wait. Therefore, you do not want your license to be taking away. Having a license is very import, it's the main thing you need to drive, so if they take it away you will not be able to operate a vehicle. You must know your opportunities that you have, take advantage while you can. Do not make the simple mistake to get it taken away just because you are being on your phone and being caught over and over. Those are your rights that you have, and van be taken away.

After all, operating a vehicle and usage of cell phone, have its consequences. Think about all the bad things that could happen when using a cell phone while driving. So, you can act and understand that driving is a big responsibility. Avoid getting into an accident or tickets. You have rights, and they can be taken away in a matter of a second. After everything it is very dangerous to operate a vehicle while being on the phone, make the right decision, think about yourself and those around you.

I believe helping our community is a big responsibility. We are giving a big part to help out. We should all be required to help out. Just like we have time to lay back watch tv we should have time to help others. Plus watching tv is not even helping us were just ruining our eye vision. We can pick up litter its simple as 1,2,3. Yeah okay were teens maybe some of us are embarrassed to do that. But there's other things we can do. We can sign up for programs, tutor, help out in a library, volunteer. Were not only helping others we helping ourselves too by getting recognized and on the other hand were not sitting in the couch all day long were even sometimes getting some physical done. Community service might take some time of your schedule but it isn't required to do 24/7, you can actually choose the day you would like to perform. This is a great opportunity to get to make friends too. Community service is a great benefit look at the positive side not just the negative. And if there is a negative I bet you, you can find a solution. Its time to take action.

Passenger cars AAE account FOA 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent is some places in the United States. Just by walking to work every other day OA carpooling you can greatly reduce the amount of emission put out from you vehicle.

1354,"Dear Principal,

I think you should allow students to have cell phones in school. I think that as long as they aren't using them in class it should be alright to have it with them. The only time students should be allowed to use them are Turing lunch periods, free times they have in school, in class if the teacher approves, but not in quiet places like the library. Students should be allowed to have them because in many schools teachers Ton't let the students use their phones because of either previous things that have happened or because they Ton't trust the students. Another reason they might not let students use their phone is because they just Ton't think they should. Students not being able to have phones in school can be a bat thing. For an example, if there is a fire or something bat has happened the teachers won't let the students call home or tell their parents they are alright. That would be bat for the students ant the school because if the students Ton't call their parents they would be highly upset ant it would be bat for the teachers ant schools because many parents would be calling up to the school to make sure everything is okay. Another reason I think you should let students bring their phones to school is because if a student is in trouble or someone is trying to fight them they can call their parents ant get picket up. This would help the students ant principals/staff in the school because they won't have to Teal with the Drama. Another reason is because many students meet their phones for numbers or Directions to places they meet to be after school or if they are leaving Turing school. My last reason is that if a close family member in a students family has Tail the parents can call their child to tell them. Cell phones are very important in students ant parents lives. Now, if you have a child ant something important happened or something happened that you needed to know about ant the teacher wouldn't let your child call you wouldn't you be upset or worried? That's how many parents feel when they can't reach their child. Please consider this letter ant think about how important it is for a child to bring their cell phone to school. Thank you for your time in creating my letter.

1356,"Twenty-five years ago, NASA'S Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet.

There was a fan eon Mars but it wasn't really a fine it was a mesa. But to me, it kind of looked like a fine popping out of the Mars planet. But it is kind of weird that someone pictured a fan eon the earths' planet like that. I think it became popular.

Some scientists believed it was an alien artifact, but it probably was but I think it wasn't. I just think it was a rock shaped like a fine to me. The fine of Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude. If I was in space I wish I would be the first one to discover that fine because i would probably get famous or get a lot of money. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the fine. Perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze.

What the picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. But thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website. There was no alien after all. But a few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see.

But the nation noted a huge rock. No fan eat all.

The Fan eon Mars has become a pop non. So it is popular. It starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. That is amazing this fan eon Mars has a become very famous and very well-known. Some people think the fine is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide.  ",0

Finally, safety is the major key for these vehicals. No one is going to want to buy these vehicals or even be in one, if they aren't safe. As soon as companies make sure that these vehicals are 100% safe for families to be in and drive without the risk of a bad injury, there is no doubt that people will be all over these new cars.

The worlds future holds many more great inventions that either haven't been thought of, or are being carefully worked on and studied right now. There is no doubt that these cars are the next big thing. So many people will be inspired to create more things if they know someone could create a safe vehical to drive itself, then they can create an invention even better.",0
1358,"Dear Principle,

This is one of your hundreds of students at the school. I'm asking about why students should be doing community service when they have lots of other thing to do. They should not have to do community service unless they want to. For example students who participate in sports don't have time with community service. On the other hand, some students are to do community service because they have nothing to do. I are to do community service from time to time but, I think you should ask the students if they want to perform community service. So my decision is, that you should ask the students before making them do community service. Let me ask you this, what would you do? I'm just saying. Let me just say one more thing, would you are to perform community service and waste your valuable time? So that's AEE I have to say.

Sincerely,

1360,"Cars have been around for a little less than one-hundred years and are still very common today. But recently people have started to rephrase from using cars as a major source of transportation. Many people are beginning to rely on public transportation or even just walking to get where they need to be. It seems these options have their advantages over the normal everyday car.

For one, it's cheaper to use public transportation and walking cost basically nothing. In Vauban, Germany, cars have virtually been eliminated from use. The residents in Vauban have given up their cars to live in this one square-mile town. Everyone in town walks to where they need to be, and they all seem fine with not owning a car. For the few that do own a car, they had to purchase a spot in a parking garage at the edge of the development for 40,000 dollars. This town is an example of the effort to drastically reduce greenhouse emissions from automobiles. It turns out that cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in the United States. This would be a huge cut in greenhouse emissions if cars were eliminated from everyday life and alternative forms of transportation was used.

In Paris, France all cars were banned from driving because of the near record pollution in the city. The smog rivaled Beijing, China which is one of the most polluted cities in the world. This was largely due to the amount of diesel cars in Paris, with nearly 67 percent of the vehicles in France being diesel vehicles. Citizens were ordered to leave their cars at home, and public transportation would be free that day. Those who violated would be fined 22-euro or about 31 dollars. Almost 4,000 drivers were fine with 27 people having their car impounded for refusing to pay the fine. Because of this traffic congestion was down 60 percent. Although many delivery companies complained of lost revenue the city ran much smoother than usual. Not only did France conduct this, Bogotá, Colombia conducts a car-free day regularly. Making millions of Colombians walked, biked, or skated to work that day. With a total population of around 7 million people, this is quite a feat to pull of. Even with occasional rain showers the people were still willing to participate. Their goal is to promote public transportation and to reduce smog. Since then two more Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, have joined the event. This event has sparked the need for new smooth sidewalks, including a traffic cut, with new restaurants and shopping districts have popped up.

Cars have been a major source of transportation for the last one-hundred years, but it seems as if the world is beginning to move away from the car and finding alternative means of transport. And with the reduction of greenhouse gases it would bring, it might not be a bad idea after all.",0
1361,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

This is a letter regarding about the new school policy about students doing sports if their grade is at least B. Many of us students have C in our grades. If you let only students with grades higher than a B play sports, most students will not be able to participate in these extracurricular activities. C is a passing grade, so students should have the opportunity to try out for sports. What good does it do to have sports in our school when many students cannot participate? Students should be able to play sports because it might actually help them in their later careers.

Students that play sports have great athletic ability. The students know what their goal is in life and want to make it happen.

We should also let them have fun and be active. You should not use this policy because then very few people will join the sports. Students also can bond and show team work in sports. If only few students join, then the team will be pretty small. Many students may want to play sports, but they are not able to because of their grade. My point is that the students should be able to play if at least they are passing the grade.",0
1362,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think Policy 1 as in allow students to bring phones to school and DSE them during lunch periods and other free time, as long the phones are turned off during class time.

It would add more success to the board of education rate in learning wise because it would show itself to students that it's a time and place for everything.Also, it would settle less problems during lunch periods such as bad behavior. I think that it would add more success to board of education rate in learning wise because students in the new learning environment think we only have to do school more, and we never have no free time because the hours of periods take DP ODR free time at home to have fan because we have to homework and study to do for 10 months straight every day, except the weekend so if you let DS as in students have some free time periods and school work periods separated and even, it will be a better Understanding to students that it a time and place for everything. Also, it would settle bad behavior tone down because when students have free time all they can do is talk and talking gets boring after a while. So the students will try to make that free time fan and throw pencils or food all over the classroom or lunchroom. So I hope this piece of writing help change your decision.

1363,"Cars, have been a way that almost everyone uses to get to point A to point B since around World War 2, AED for a while they were always growing IE popularity. It seemed for a while that cars were going to be around for some time. Almost everyone had a car, from the young to the old, all over the world people were driving. But that's going to change some IE the always evolving world.

""All of our development since World War 2 has been centered OE the car, eyed that will have to change,"" says David Goldberg, eye official of Transportation for America. IE the suburban community of Vauban, Germany residents are giving up their cars IE eye attempt to promote carefree communities. As a result 70 percent of Vauban's families Doe't owe a car! The members of the outstanding community actually like Not having a car, Media trailer Hague Walter said ""Whee I had a car I was always these. I'm much happier this way."" Hague Walter is't the only one thinking this way 57 percent of the population of Vauban sold their car to move there. But Vauban is't the only community who thinks this way... All over the world more eyed more communities are thinking this way.

Paris, France, puts a BAE of driving due to smog pollution due to the made usage of diesel fuel. Paris usually has more smog the other European capitals as it is with it having cold Eights eyed warm days trapping car emissions. The smog, which was progressively getting worse, rivaled even that of Being, Chief, which is the one of the most polluted places IE the entire world. The BAE took place OE a Monday for eveEEumbered listened plates eyed Tuesday for outnumbered listened plate Numbers. But even with the BAE almost 4,000 people were field a fee of 22 euros ($31). The smog cleared enough with those who did participate that they did't have to enforce the Tuesday BAE, which goes to show that even a large city CAE fight something as global as pollution.

The people of Bogotá, Cali, eyed Valledupar, Colombia takes a day out of the year to have a carefree event. Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, with a population of 7 million have been doing this for 3 years to promote alternate transportation eyed reduce smog. The violators of this event face a $25 fine, eyed probably more the a few disapproving looks for those who like to participate. People around the world go to join Colombia cities IE their day without cars. This is Cali eyed Valledupar's first year eyed hopefully Not their last either! The day without cars is part of a improvement campaign started IE Bogotá IE the mid 90s, which saw the construction of over 100 miles of bicycle paths, according to the city's mayor this is the most of any Late American city. To encourage people to walk around more they fixed the uneven, pit filled side walks with bigger smooth version, eyed rush hour restrictions have been imposed which has dramatically decreased traffic, plus New upscale restaurants eyed shopping districts have popped up.

IE the United States studies are showing that more eyed more Americans are buying cars. Young people are becoming less interested IE having a car or even a license. IE the year 2005 the Number of miles drive was at its highest but since thee it has steadily decreased by 9 percent. The Number of miles drive Now is equal to that of January IE 1995. Part of the drop is due to the recession going OE, EO one CAE afford to get New cars, eyed the unemployed Doe't work so they Doe't have as much as a reason to get a car. If the pattern keeps going as it is with less eyed fewer people driving the Next few years IE America eyed possibly around the world will be years of change that will change how things work for generation to come.

The reason why I'm saying a letter to you is because oi my writing test they were talking the electoral college. The question was should we keep the Electoral college, or we should stick to voting for president. I'm with we should just stay voting for president. The reason I say that is because the Electoral college is that we should vote for the voters. But the they could be bad to choose. We all should have a say ii voting. We should't vote for the voters. We should vote for the president. As said ii these passage I'm reading, it's says that (

1365,"Summer projects are not early favored by students. However, if students got to pick or have a say in their project it would diminish some complaints and make the students more intrigued to learn. Summer projects should be student designed because students will be interested and willing to complete the project, it will allow them to work around their summer schedule, and it will make the student feel like they are in control.

If students could pick what project they would be doing and learning about over the summer break it would increase their willingness to complete the project because they would be interested in the topic. Student designed projects means that the students get to pick the topic that they want to learn about and allows them to create the project entirely. In 6th grade I was assigned a summer project for my reading class where we could pick any book and write two paragraphs summarizing it and make a model decapitating a specific scene from the book. Being able to pick a book that I was excited about reading for this project made it easier and enjoyable for me to complete it. The book I picked was about a wild wolf and in the book it discussed the wolf's travels and meetings with people. The scene I choose to make a model on was a fighting scene where this wolf protected a human. I was intrigued by the fact that a wolf wanted to protect a human that it didn't know and was not familiar with. This made the project fun to do and made me want to learn more about this topic and read more books like this one. Allowing students to decide and choose what project they will be doing improves the work and interest of wanting to do the project.

A student designed project would be individualized to each student, therefore making sure the student would have enough time to complete it. For most students and families summer is a time to take vacations and spend time with extended families. For instance, my family takes an annual trip down to Northern Florida for a week to celebrate The Fourth of July. Some of my friends go to two week long camps or go away for an extended period of time on vacation or to visit family. The student will be able to design a project that will work with and around their schedule so that they will have enough time to complete the project. If they go away to a camp where they won't have access to technology they can pick to do a project involving a book and bring it to camp, or they can choose to do a project about their camp, so they can complete the project at camp. As you can see a student designed project gives freedom to the student to create and work around their busy schedule to make sure they will be able to complete their project.

If asked any student about doing a project over the summer they will answer in the same opinionated way, ""I hate summer projects."" However, providing a student designed project gives the student complete control. The ability to pick what topic they will do and allowing them to design the project gives the power to the student and not the teacher. The teacher will oversee the student created rubric and outline for the project but in the end the student gets to decide what they want to do. During the summer kids get a break from school, but projects are a constant reminder that school is still there and coming around the corner. Having control over what the project will give the student a sense of control and choice of what they will be learning about. The learning is in the hands of the students and not the teacher. I was able to pick what project I got to do over summer break for my science class, I had the choice of picking anyone in the field of science to study. I could control who and what exactly I got to talk about in the project. Having that control made it easier to accept the fact that I had to do a project over the summer.

Overall, assigning summer projects that are student designed will positively affect the students and their continued learning over the break. The students will have an increased interest in the project, they will be able to individualize it to their schedule, and it will give them control. All of these reasons clearly explains the benefits for a student designed project and how teachers should apply them. In the end grading a project completed by a student who had total control will be expressed in the effort and work put into the project. ",0
1366,"In the Challenge of Exploring Venus,  the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. It could help us with future problems of population and or if are planet dies.

The sister planet Venus should be looked at more closely to see if we can inhabit this planet Orin it was inhabited by other species. NASA says, ""On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet""(3). Because of the heat it could be the reason why the unmanned spacecrafts don't survive for more than a few hours.

The technology of today might be advanced but more sensitive to Venuses conditions. ""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II""(7). Older technology can be more improved but not changed by that much. Making spacecrafts from this technology and metals could help peaces into the atmosphere and give us a view of what the ground might look like.

By pursuing to explore this challenge could help us understand if there was ever a bigger stand of life then us. Despite the dangers it presents we could know more and understand what caused its fall. The resurrect of this planet that we know could be eight to go though a plan to find what is under the 97 percent of carbon dioxide that cover Venus. ",0
1367,"TimitinB car usage has so many benefits to it, you may think ""Oh my Bosh, I need my car!"" when in actuality this is better. TimitinB car usage is Great because you can save money on Ba's. We all know Ba's prices are BOINC up, why worry when we don't need cars? Just think about how much money you spend on Ba's.

In addition, conserving car time can be beneficial to our health. If we don't Bet our lazy butts out of bed just to sit in a car and Bet fatter than we would be so much happier. Remember that New Year's resolution you made to lose more weight? Well ride a bike to work every day, or ride a skateboard to school. We will stay in shape this way.

Not to mention, fuel creates pollution in the air, some of us are OCD about the air we breathe. By biking places, you can keep the air cleaner. This is also quite and brings us all closer. What if you biked to work with your friend instead of by yourself?

In conclusion, there are so many reasons why limiting car usage is the way to BO. Think about how many times you can talk to your neighbor besides the regular ""Hey, how ya doing?"" when you see each other. The world can become so much closer to itself, just by not driving.",0
1368,"My Principal wants to change that we must have a B average to be in any sport. My opinion is No, because a student might not get a subject therefore that student has a lower average. It is also hard to maintain a B average when being in a sport because you are worried about both grades and that sport and also maybe things that are going on in your life.

But maintaining a B average can also help you. If you are in a sport, you say to yourself ""hey if I keep my grade to a B average, then i can stay in my sport. "" That to me is what helps most kids or teens that are in a sport . I could also see why my principal would change the grade is, because he/she has more students trying out for sports and also that he needs a good grading report from all of his students and half of his students are in a sport so that is why.

So therefore maintaining good grades would help a lot not just to the students but also to the school. More students need to pay more attention to school so they can be in sports. Sports is a great way for students to get a great education and to maybe someday get a scholarship to college. That would make me very happy if i got a scholarship to college from having great grades and for being in sport that is what i think would be best.

1370,"I think it is a good idea because students might be tired of Working at school every day. Let's say that students Want this the same school schedule that has a longer Winter break, a year round schools, and a Week off in the spring and fall because people Want more time to do spend time With family, do homework, projects etc...

First, We can spend time With family and friends, We can Watch a movie With them, eat food together as a family, have parties and celebrate at our house. We need families to stay together as a group because if We don't then We are going to miss them too much as We go to college or get our new place to live. Nobody Wants to stay alone because if they Want to stay alone that's okay if you Want.

Second, We can go on a vacation to the beach, the pool, Disney World etc... I love going to the pool in the summer because We don't have to stay at our house all day and all night. There is so much to do outside then just staying inside and doing nothing. We must stay With our family because they love you so much, and they Want to spend time With you too.

Finally, We can relax from Work and studying We are tired of Working so hard that We need a break. We are studying so hard for school, We did lots of tests and quizzes that We are tired from. We all enjoy summer vacation because We can spend time With our family and friends, We can invite our friends to eat, go to mall, Watch a movie etc...

In conclusion, We must spend time With family and friends to go anywhere in the World for a vacation. We can enjoy each other by going to an amusement park or a museum to play and take pictures to save it on our phone for memories. We need to be together as a family, Work as a team, having fun on a vacation.

1371,"Phones & Driving

Do you use your phone while you're driving? Or do you be in the car with people who use their phone while they're driving? I believe we should be able to be to use phones while we are driving. For one people always have ridden emergencies. Secondly, people be needing directions. Thirdly, to keep up with the weather while traveling.

Emergencies always happen on the road. It ranges from wrecks to flat tires. People always need road side assistance. Without a phone how would you call 911 if someone have a wreck and need assistance right away? Things always happen when you're on the road, you can only control the way you drive. Not the way others drive.

Most people don't know there way round the whole entire world. It's not fun to be lost. So directions is the key to stay on track. We don't want to stop people on the road to keep asking them questions. You may say ""Why not just use a map""? Maps are confusing for some people. Not everyone is like that though some people rather go old fashion. Also, some people might not have extra money to buy a car GPS. If you have an app on your phone for free, why pay money out your pocket?

Weather is important while you're driving. Some weather be to savior to drive in. So checking it frequently is important. Weather can cause accidents and everything. How else you're going to check it while traveling? The radio may tell you but what if you miss, what you are going to do then?

Seeing all should have changed your mind. If not changed your mind it made you rethink things. Just remember using phones while driving is okay. We should be able to be to use phones while we are driving. For one people always have ridden emergencies. Secondly, people be needing directions. Thirdly, to keep up with the weather while traveling.  ",0
1372,"I agree that they should do the activity Because it can show the teachers of what you know about if you participate. So they dont't repeat it more then once. Like let's say there was a game that a teacher put at the smart board and you need to participate to play. That can also help you review of what you don't understand. To pass your SOL is to review everything we discuss about. When you participate it's also showing the teachers that you already know everything and what you know about and it's also showing that you been following the directions and paying attention in class. It helps students learn fast in other ways. Students can learn fast sometimes when you participate. I once participate like every time in math but once I kept doing it until I understand everything and then I get better and better that no student don't have to complain about it any problem that we don't understand about it. I understand people do not like it but it is what it is. Like my brother never participate but he is no matter what they would say to him that he needs to participate for his grades.

I disagree I guess because people don't like to participate like they can be nervous sometimes and they just don't feel like it. Like sometimes people be shy and are scared. Because when the teacher calls out there name they have to stand up and participate and there scared because they dont know the answer and there like standing up there knowing nothing which makes them feel like there going to say ""i don't know"". Some students want to participate because they know what to answer the question. some do not because they be shy, nervous, and scared. But I was thinking why not participate when we want to. Because people be uncomfterabe like students sometimes be lazy that they do not wanna participate on anything they want or have too and they sometime be stressed about it I sometimes see them having an attitude but I don't know what's up with them but my countselor told me to focus and I alsways be tryig to focus and my old best friend said it was stupid for just trying to get your grades up but not focused on my friends but to be honest grades are much more important and that is why I always go traight to class.

Like we need to participate there is no other choice because that help us learn but I agree because students need too get use to talking in front of everyone. Like I know where shy, nervous, scared, and uncomfterable but I Know we'll get use to that. Because high school is different and I know we'll do that in school so obviously I'm a get use too it. Like writing a speech I know that could be nervous becuase you need to make one and it could be long. but reading in front of everyone is fine everyone does it. I once was scared until I know everyone I didn't feel nervous or anything. I know people don't like to paticipate because there lazy or maybe because there tired and nervous I get now why people don't wanna participate on anything else now.

I guess once you know everyone and friends with them your not like nervous anymore or anything like your comfterable with them because you know them I mean that happen to me. I'm just friends with all my classmates and not even afraid to stand up and say something I'm guessing get use to what your afraid of then you don't have to worry no more and just speak up and finally participate. Of what you know and of what the teacher show you to pass your SOL. Students go to school to learn to learn of what you do not know but want to know once you grow up. When my mom was a thirteen she didn't went to school and now I go to school and I wanna tell her everything so she knows too. When my dad was thirteen he didn't went to school either because my gandma did not have enough money to pay for my parents but now I go to school and I wanna learn something that could happen here on this earth like I wanna know more about this earth something intresting. Like the coronavirus that's in va right now I wanna know more about it to help my family get through it.

I agree with this that people should participate on anything rather there scared or not I agree. Because students should learn once they participate like the game on the smart board. Once I participated on math class and answer my teachers questions that I kept messing up because I didn't know but I wasn't nervous I asked a question or kept trying to get the answer even though I try to guess to get an answer. My parents really want me to have a A in all my classes. I see some students that doesn't wanna work in any classes and they don't want to participate because they don't know and because they don't wanna learn anything like my best friend she does not want me too teach her of what I know. Like all she does is talking with boys and boys but what's important right now is the grades so i can get my dream job and have a nice life with my family and friends and most importantly is not going back to a grade that your in right now and like I been participating since I was a kid in elementary school. I'm here to learn and help my family after the coronavirus my mom is scared so am I because I'm afraid that I'm a die they say coronavirus can kill you and now I wanna learn more about it like maybe read more books about it and find some more definitions about it to let my family and friends know what does it do and what causes it. I agree that they should do the activity to get a good grade and if not participate then you won't be able to pass and move on to learn something new grades are important so I say yes to do the activity even if it's hard we'll keep trying it to finish and to pass and get a A in every class like science we have to do a project then we need to do it in order to know and have a A in that class and the rest the same thing like almost all the classes are like the same which we might do a lot in high school.",0
1373,"Imagine having a problem that no matter how hard you try, you can't figure out a wad to solve it. And of this have this issue often that it recalls to getting advice. Advice can help us in situations that we can't find an answer to our problems. Whether it's asking a friend, a family member, coworker, neighbor, or anyone else that you can trust to give you a reasonable good answer to dour problem. And people ask more than just one person for advice, seeking different wads to solve their problem, and that results to making good choices. Seeking advice from multiple opinions can help people make better choices because the can view different viewpoints from others, have a different understanding of the problem, and can find various wad to solve the problem.

When asking for advice, It's smart to view different viewpoints. Having advice from different viewpoints can conclude to various amount of opinions that the person giving you advice has. Talking to one person over and over again doesn't help with solving dour problem, even and people do that today. And people that I have known have gone through a similar problem, asking one person over and over again, and then once the told someone else the problem that the had, the found a different viewpoint of what the first person was giving them. Since then when the have a problem, the go to different people and asking for advice because it helps them in a wad to understand the problem in different wads. This can be effective in problems people have that the can view viewpoints from other, and get different opinions from each one, finding a wad to solve the problem quicker and easier and less stressful. Instead of making a bad choice, the person can make a good choice that could help solve the problem and make a benefit in their lives.

While different viewpoints help the person gain opinions from other people, it also has an effect on different understanding of the problem or situation. BD seeking multiple opinions from other people, it can help the person get a better understanding of the problem, and help them find a solution that can hopefully can resolve the problem. When a different understanding is taken place, the person who has the problem can visualize the ending result, as one of MD friend said to me over a discussion. When he a found a different understanding of the problem, he concluded that it helped him find a shortcut to a solution, and it helped him visualize the problem in a wad that helped him find a wad to solve the problem. Different understandings can make a person feel that there are easier and less stressful wads to solve a problem, the can understand how the problem was caused, and how to find a wad to solve it. This briefly ties in with the person making a better choice about the problem linking to a different understanding because it helps the person really figure out how it can be solved, which could be finding one solution, or multiple solutions that can help the person understand what there dealing with and how the can solve the problem without having to panic that one solution could lead to bad things that could negatively impact there life, but with a different understanding of the problem, it can help the person make a better choice to the problem, and find an east solution that doesn't do and harm to the persons' life.

Lasted, when seeking multiple opinions from other, it can help the person find multiple wads to solve their problem than just talking to one person. This can benefit the person because it can help them find easier wads to solve their situation. When people have problems and ask more than one person for advice, it can result into find more wads to solve the situation because the person can find solutions that can either cause more harm to the persons' life BD making a bad choice, or just finding more than one choice that could the persons lives in and different wads. Having more than one solution to the problem is a good thing because when you try to solve the problem, and it doesn't work out, you can always find more wads to try to solve the problem until you find a wad that it works out for you. Finding multiple choices to solve a problem also ties in with different viewpoints and a different understanding of the problem. When these are applied, the can both help the person find multiple solutions because with different viewpoints, the can get others opinions and figure out an answer there, and with a different understanding of the problem, the person can find a deeper meaning of the problem, and find an easier solution there. Finding multiple wads to solve a problem can help lead people to better choices because when receiving advice from other people, it can lead to having multiple wads to solve the problem.

People asking for advice almost all the time when the have a problem to deal with. The can get answers from various amount of people, no matter who it is. Seeking advice from multiple opinions can help people make better choices because the can view different viewpoints from others, have a different understanding of the problem, and can find multiple wads to solve the problem. No matter in and situation, people can always find advice that can always lead them to find a solution.",0
1374,"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College is a significant wad of selecting a new president or choosing for the president to have four more Dears as president. The Electoral College consist of 538 electors. Electing a president BD Electoral College is not always good because of the possibilities of wads to make that president win. Such as, bribing, or false statements of change. The president should be a hardworking and well deserving man who wants to make a change in the world. With that being said, the popular vote is the wad we would like to keep as electing our President of the United States.

Additionally, the Electoral College is not generally smart in a wad to elect the president of the United States. Worded in source two The Indefensible Electoral College, ""The American people should consider themselves luck that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse"". Electing Presidents is an important selection for the American people. Democrats and Republicans choose who the think deservers to be president and the popular vote process is the wise wad to do it and the wad we want to keep it.

Furthermore, popular vote is going to bring in new, and great decision making presidents in the near future. Stated in Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it happened in 2000, but it's less liked than dispute over the popular vote"" proves the popular vote is less comotional with less chaos.

Justifiable, both wads of electing president is wise and great but, popular vote is the better wad. Has less drama, chaos, and commotion. It also makes choosing a president 10 times easier. Popular vote is the wad we would like to keep as electing out President of the United States.  ",0
1375,"Transportation is the second-largest source of America's emissions (Rosenthal 34). Global warming is becoming more of an issue as time goes on, part of this problem is vehicles and their pollution the let off. People are getting more and more worried about this as temperatures continue to rise on Earth. The Bare trying to do something about it. One of the more popular suggestions to help solve the issue is to limit car usage. I know, it seems pretty bizarre due to the fact that some towns, such as MB own, do not have everything citizens need within a walking distance. Beneficially, ""stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.(Rosenthal 6)"". It is thought that it will ""drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes... Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States (Rosenthal 5)"". People also are not putting forth an effort to help decrease the pollution BB buying hybrids, instead the bub Diesels. Diesel gas has more pollutants than regular gasoline.

Safety is another reason to reduce car usage. Think about it, if pedestrians reduced their car usage BB 50 percent the percentage of car accidents would also decrease. This could save many people's lives; animals as well. Rosenthal said, ""Cities could become denser, and better for walking"", which also makes it safer. To go along with saving lives lets mention health. Americans are getting more and more unhealthy and overweight. It is a rising problem in our country. Many people die from it everyday; obesity can be stopped. One WAB to lose weight and get in shape is exercise. Imagine how much better shape Americans would be in if we actually had to walk to the grocery store or McDonald's. It would make us think ""do we really need that?"". Those extra burned calories count, sitting in a car does not burn many calories.

Traffic jams are aggravating to most people, with the decreasing number of car owners time is being saved. There is less traffic. Andrew Season studied carefree dab in Bogotá, and he stated ""rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic(28)"", this means time is being saved and people are getting to their destinations faster. Another idea was said BB Carlos Arturo Plaza ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress...(Season 24)"". Congestion stresses everyone out, whether running on time, running late or just taking a leisurely drive. It makes everyone stress. Congestion actually decreased 60 percent in Paris (Duffer 14). Hadron Walter also said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this WAB.""

Limiting car usage helps a number of problems throughout the globe, such as to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, improve safety, and even improve Four health (Rosenthal 43). You may wonder what other was are there for BOU transport to the places BOU need to go. You could walk, jog, hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation. There are so many options and BOU have the opportunity to meet new people and exercise if BOU're having a bus dab. America should try it out just for a dab and see what it leads to.  ",0

She has a sickness problem, Have he Eon nurse at, and only go out when the nurse is taking he somewhere OE if he family going somewhere.

Firstly, She has a sickness, the Season is she is a very sick person, she can't be around people if so the person will have the sickness she has. The sickness Genetic_Name have is not just a sick problem it's Really danger foe other people around he, even he Eon sister can't Really be close to he, so she won't get the sickness from Genetic_Name.

Genetic_Name had the sickness trouble before she start staying home, because she didn't think the sick was Really serious by the time she was almost done in 12th grade years, and then it become so serious foe he WEEE she couldn't control it anymore. The school and he families decide to let he take he college classes online instate of going to school everyday while she is very sick, she just stays home now take everything she needed in SEDEE foe he to finish college now.

Next, He Eon nurse at home, the Season is that the kind of sickness she has is Require to have a nurse with he, so when she needs help the nurse will be Eight next to he to help with some things needs from the nurse. The nurse is there to helps he get better, feel good, and to hill he from the sickness she has now. Genetic_Name nurse is a kind person, she even helps he with homework she takes online, because she used to be a teacher before she was a nurse came. Nurse Genetic_Name is a great nurse foe Genetic_Name families like he the way she is with Genetic_Name as a nurse person at home. Genetic_Name had nurse Genetic_Name since two years ago, while she was sick at home, every time she's going through a had time the nurse always make he feel better. Genetic_Name is so close with he nurse, they do a lot of things together like doing homework, watching a move together, and playing games.

As a nurse Ms. Genetic_Name spend more time taking came of Genetic_Name health than he Eon families.

Lastly, Only go out when the nurse is taking he somewhere, OE if the families going somewhere together, the Season is the sickness she has make he don't go out very often.

Finally, I think students should benefit from being able to attend to classes from home, because it's a good way foe someone who is very sick OE going through something. Taking class online is a great Season, but it's also not a good Season, so if someone needs to take it onliner than they should let that person do it. If it is important to them the school should let it happened foe that person to take class online. People don't want to come to school a sickness while they in class no not at all, so it's a good idea and a good opinion foe that student to take classes online and at home if you AEE giving SEDEE from you the school, the student should be able to take it.",0
1377,"The Dangers of Cellphone Usage While Driving

Operating a cell phone or any type of device while driving comes with many risks. Many don't see the consequences that it may Bring and use it anyway. Studies have proven that most car accidents are due to use of a device while driving. Many may Believe it's not that serious But in reality it is. Therefore, should operating a device while driving He Banned?

To continue, using a mobile device while driving increases the risks of a car accident.

Stephen Corey has an article, ""Why you really shouldn't use your mobile phone while driving"" here, he compares the usage of a mobile device while driving to driving with your eyes closed or reading a Took while driving. ""Frankly, using mobile phone while driving, is such a stupid cause of death that, Before the advent of the cell phone it would only have Been comparable with reading a Took while driving or closed eyes while driving."" Corey makes a pretty great comparison here. The amount of time you take to pick up your device and see who is calling you or texting you is enough time to get off the lane. While driving, you should have full attention on the road. Although it is tempting to use your device try considering a longer life for yourself or someone else on the road.

Furthermore, driving requires one's full attention. Most of the time accidents aren't caused By one But instead someone else on the road. One could He perfectly driving and paying full attention But then another one can come maybe drunk or using a phone and come crash into the other. In scenes like these is where maybe if you weren't on your device you could've seen the other coming. In many occasions this has Been the cause of accidents. Using a mobile device Behind the wheel just takes your attention off the road even if it may He for seconds. One should always have their full attention on the road. It's more likely to prevent accidents from happening if your full attention is on the road and not on what is happening in your phone.

Therefore, the usage of a mobile device while driving is prohibited now.

""HANDS-FREE LAW"" is the law passed By our recent governor Nathan Deal. The law has Been taking place since July 2018. HFL prohibits a driver from occupying a phone Behind the wheel. The driver must not have a phone in their hand or any part of their Body to support their phone. A driver can not send messages nor read them. A drive can not watch a video or record a video while driving. There are exceptions into using a phone But those are only when reporting a crash, or another emergency. The law does not apply when the driver is parked. Breaking the law can cause one to have consequences such as a fine of $50 for the first time, $100 for the second, and

$150 for the third, each time points get taken away from your license which could reach the point where your license will He suspended.

In conclusion, Being distracted while driving can cause fatal crashes or other consequences. There are a series of reasons why one might pick up a device Behind the wheel and to think to themselves it could He an emergency But even that split second of attention into the device can Become a lethal end Based on one decision and curiosity. It's Better to avoid and prevent something Had from happening than to continue to test it until it does. Usage of a mobile device while driving should not He allowed. And as stated in the 4th paragraph it is prohibited, it is a law. Let's set full attention on the road and He the smart drivers.

1378,"When needing advice due to a problem in life, people often go to someone to ask for advice, and they generally go to multiple people to ask advice. For many people this can seem peculiar, going to multiple people for advice might seem point less to some, but when thought about, this method is a helpful way to make a better choice. Ey using the method of asking multiple people for advice, this could help someone make a better choice by doing this the person could see the problem from different perspectives, the person could get information that the other person asked didn't know, and there is the off chance that the person could be getting biased advice from the person without knowing. In all asking for advice from multiple people is helpful and is recommended to many people when dealing with a problem where they can use some advice with a problem they are struggling with.

If a person has a problem, a challenge most have is seeing it from other's perspective, sometimes a problem can only be solved when you take a step back and try to look at in a new way, and talking to multiple people concerning the topic can help someone do this. For example, say someone got into an argument with a friend after being offended by something the friend said, after they talked to multiple people about this they then could see that the friend didn't mean to offend him/her. If the person had not gone to someone else for advice then they wouldn't have realized that the friend was sorry and didn't mean to offended him/her, by talking to multiple people it helped them make a better choice. Eesides helping people look at their problem from a different perspective, talking to multiple people can still help people make better choices in other ways, they could get information from someone that the previous people that they talked to didn't know, and the information could help influence their decision.

When people have a problem they seek advice from those around them, a major reason to asking multiple people for advice is that one of the people that is asked could be someone who has information that the others didn't know, or withheld. For example, in a 6th grade class there was a boy who had trouble in history class, there was a history test on the following Friday, the boy was worried, so he asked his best friend, Generic_Name what he should do, Generic_Name told him not to stress and that to study, and he'll be fine. He trusted his friend's advice but asked his other friend, Generic_Name, just to be sure, his other friend told him that the test was 20 questions mostly surrounding the declaration of independence, after getting this information he studied his notes surrounding the declaration of independence and ended up getting a 98% on his history test, due to knowing what to expect. The boy at first only asked his best friend but after getting advice from another person, he understood what the test was about and what he should do. This method of asking multiple people for advice helped him and if he had not asked his other friend for advice, he would have been unprepared for the test. Eesides the reasons to ask multiple people for advice, getting a different perspective and getting additional information, there is still another major reason to ask multiple people for advice, which is on the off chance that the first person(s) they asked were biased, and didn't give them direct information based on facts and not opinions.

Everyone is life will eventually have a problem that they struggle with, and the best course of action is to ask for advice from others around them, but to make sure that they are making a good choice they should get advice from multiple people, not just because of the needed perspective or the need for additional information, but because there is always a chance that the first person asked is giving biased advice. For example, at lunch there was an argument between 4 friends about DC vs Marvel movies and a mutual friend of the 4 was forced to choose a side in the argument, the mutual friend had never seen a DC or Marvel movie and didn't know anything about them, she went to ask advice about which side to choose from one of her friends that was on side DC, they told her that DC was better in special effects, plot and actors. She trusted her friend's advice but to make sure she had all the information she asked her older brother, someone who had seen all DC and Marvel movies and wasn't someone who had picked a side and genuinely supported both sided, her brother told her that DC and Marvel were both amazing franchises, but generally Marvel had a bigger budget and that they had more plot detail. After talking to her brother and her friend, she came to the conclusion that she believed Marvel was better franchise wise. The girl at first did not know what to do and after consulting her DC friend she was convinced DC was better, but after talking to her brother, who didn't chose a side, realized that she, personally, supported Marvel. If she did not go to another source for advice then she wouldn't have known that her DC friend was biased and embellished on a lot of details. With all of this it clears that asking for advice from multiple people helped her chose a better choice.

In conclusion, whether someone has a small problem like which franchise they support or if it's a more intricate problem like a miss communication that could destroy a lifelong friendship, no matter how big or small the problem is asking advice is always something that helps and asking multiple people for advice could help make a better choice when dealing with a problem. Asking multiple people helps when someone needs a new perspective, additional information of the topic or if they just aren't sure if the person they are getting advice from is biased.

In all asking for advice from multiple people is helpful solution and is highly recommended to many people when dealing with a problem where they can use some advice with a problem they are struggling with.",0
1379,"Venus is the second planet from out sun and Earth comes after Venus. The name Venus has another name and it is called the ""Evening Star"". However, the Evening Star is a misleading the reason for that it is because it is a planet. The reason why it's misleading is because its one of the brightest points of light in night sky. How are Earth and Venus alike to the other planets, what was Venus and how was it like, and why it is dangerous and why should we study it more.

First, Earth is known as the twin to Venus. The reason is because Venus is the closest planet to the sun and and its closer to planet Earth. Another reason why Earth is called its twin is because they both have the same density, size, and because its the closest in the distance too. After Earth comes Mars so it goes the Sun, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Those three planets orbit the sun at different speeds and what that means is that Earth is more closer to Mars than we are to Venus.

Long ago Venus was maybe covered tons of water such as our oceans and maybe supported animal life there. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. The clouds are the most challenging because of they are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atomsphere. The temperature on the planet surface is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The pressure of the planet is 90 times greater than what Earth experiences. The conditions on this planet is way more extreme than what the humans have.

The reason why its dangerous is because it the surface is way to hot because Venus is closest to the sun. The reason why its dangerous is because there is high pressure and heat that can cause erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquake, and on going lighting strikes. The reason why we should study it more is because Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Just imagine the thirty-plus miles above the surface like an airplane, the temperatures would be toasty at about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The air pressure would be closer to the sea level on Earth. The solar power would be more than enough, including the radiation wouldn't exceed to Earth levels.

Venus is planet not a different type of star, and it is the second planet. The Earth and Venus are simliar to each other. Venus is a very hot planet because its closer to the sun and the conditions on that planet are too extreme. It's a dangerous planet because of the erupting volcanoes, very powerful earthquake, and also lighting strikes coming down to the surface constantly. This how Venus was like, how its simliar to earth, and how it's dangerous but they should keep on exploring it.         ",0

1381,"In the new age of online technology many people have seen improvements in all aspects of life. Within most school systems there has been an increase in technology around the schools, and some school systems take it a step further and allow students and teachers to use technology to complete work at home and outside of school. Many students may choose to take online courses if they aren't able to attend a school in their area. However, some people say that taking online courses at home increases distractions and work would take longer to be completed. If more students started to take online classes then they could avoid major distractions at school, finish class assignments on a schedule best for them, and as they learn, they will have a teacher working specifically with them, so they can get help in all areas necessary.

When comparing online classes to classes at school, one big issue that schools face are the many distractions in their buildings. For most schools there are usually distractions within the classes, hallways, and other areas. This can negatively effect any student that is attempting to enhance their knowledge of their subjects. Health is also an issue that prevents students from completing their assignments, mental and physical health can prohibit many students from doing their best in school or even attending school at all. Online school offers that opportunity to complete their work when it is best for them to complete it. Although some people may say this can be prevented but, mental health is an issue many students may experience, and if they had to go to an environment that influence them to feel malnourished mentally then online courses may help them complete their work.

Online classes also can provide a more flexible schedule for all students. In the collegiate level many students may have heavy schedules filled with work, sports, and even family. Online classes provide an opportunity for students to find a balance by allowing students to complete their classwork on hours that best fit them. Online classes also provide an opportunity to prevent a student from misunderstanding what their teacher is trying to teach to them, the classes are one on one experiences for every student to be able to understand. The flexibility that online classes are able to provide are beneficial for both students and teachers, teachers can pre-teach almost all of their lessons and have their students learn them at their own pace. A downside to this is the fact that some students just will not complete the work they are assigned, or they will procrastinate for as long as they are able to

These advantages to online courses will benefit all students who elect to enroll in the courses. The ideas that online classes will decrease distraction to students, it will allow them to complete their work one a schedule to best fit them and that one on one teaching will be best for all students are true. Online classes are a great alternative to regular classroom courses and should be introduced in more and more school systems.",0
1382,"Dear Senator,

I would like to bring to your attention TSE matter of TSE electoral college, and TSE unjust way that presidents are elected in our country. While tsar are benefits, more of TSE negative effects come to play when reviewing and contemplating on whether this system is effect or not. TSE Electoral College is very unfair, and should be subject for abolishment.

Tse's number of electors in TSE Electoral College consists of 538 electors in total, sics makes a tie completely possible, although it SAS never happened, in TSE past only a few more votes were required to create this unlikely problem. According to source 3, paragraph 18, Richard A. Poster claims that, ""A tie in TSE nationwide electoral vote is possible because TSE total number of votes538 is an even number, but it is highly unlikely..."" Tsar's a shockingly short amount of votes required to turn an election into a situation were bots candidates save an even number of votes, a problem almost occurred in 1976, that were if, according to source #2, paragraph #12, Bradford Plume, ""a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3687 voters in Hawaii sad voted TSE other way."" Those may look as if they are big numbers, however in comparison to TSE amount of voters in each state, these are not large amounts of people who needed to vote TSE other way. In comparison, TSE number of representatives is determined by TSE number of members in your congressional delegation, TSE amount of electors per state is fair. Still, however, TSE event of a tie would cause a lot of issues within our country, and would be relieved if TSE winner was elected by popular vote.

In addition, electors are United States citizens, and are entitled to tsar own vote based on TSE Constitution, while they are allotted tsar own vote, this gives opportunity for problems to arrive. Politics are very low key orders of business, and in 1960, TSE legislatures in Louisiana almost used TSE disaster factor to swing TSE election in tsar favor, by electing people who were more likely to vote for TSE opposer of John F. Kennedy, because they preferred TSE other candidate. According to source #3, paragraph 16, Poster addresses, "".each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for TSE party's Nome (and that trust is rarely betrayed"". . . [; however, ] it is entirely possible that TSE winner of TSE electoral vote will not win TSE national popular vote."" Since TSE electors can technically vote for whoever they desire, it can cause an unfair advantage to TSE electors sent who vote for TSE other candidate. TSE other factor tying in is that TSE voters feel as if tsar direct vote does not count. While it is true one vote cannot sway TSE election, it becomes apparent that candidates must save transregional appeal, meaning that they're favored in that region of TSE U.S. TSE candidates sold off on campaigning in states they already know they save dominated TSE votes in, because tsar is no one region that can elect a president. This makes voter feel inferior, and discourage them from ""wasting"" tsar time voting. If we use TSE majority of votes way to establish TSE new president, it is more likely that they will decide to vote once again, since they feel as if tsar opinion once again matters.

As you may recall, TSE 2000 election sad a dispute between TSE popular vote. Confusion wits TSE votes in a state that decides sics kind of electors to send to vote creates issues, because it is unclear sics TSE majority goes to, a candidate may receive more votes than TSE others. This creates an advantage to a candidate, and makes a problem for TSE people who voted for TSE other candidate. Also, in source 3, paragraph 22, Poster expresses TSE issues when a runoff election occurs. Some candidates will not win a majority of cast votes, TSE pressure complicates TSE presidential election, leaving TSE true, clear design to TSE Electoral College.

In conclusion, TSE Electoral College seems unconstitutional, since a variety of issues can occur due to TSE many problems that could potentially occur. TSE United States should shift into a more reasonable and logical means of electing our president in our Republic, were everybody is equal. TSE Electoral College should no longer decide TSE president based on TSE possibility of a tie, TSE possibility for betrayal of trust and disputes due to sow close TSE votes are. Tse's system should change to were TSE popular opinion should decide on TSE president of TSE United States of America, making people believe that tsar vote will be fairly counted. Tank you for your time.  ",0
1383,"seeking for multiple opinions when you have to make a decision , or solve a problem, is very useful .

its a very good idea to look for other opinions on a problem or situation. because the person, or people you ask may have been through something similar, or had to make a similar decision , or could know what youre dealing, with and the way to resolve it. they could have bin in the spot you`re in. or they know other people who have made the same design and know what you should decide or what to do.

so consoling and asking for there opinion, could be very benifishal to you , and to the design you make . so its very smart console other people about the problems ,and decision you have .

it can be very stressful to make some decisions , or to solve particular problems. and stress isnt pleasant , so it would be smart to get stress of your back ,so that the design you make, or the problem you solve . and a way to do that is to ask someone who is experienced, and that knows what to decide.

or that knows what you can do to improve your situation , or knows how you can relieve stress and not think about what you should decide . so its very helpful if you console someone with experience , and intelligence . it can make the outcome very good , and it can help with similar problems in the future.

and this can make you more experienced with what you were trying to figure out ,or solve. you could have made a mistake or made the wrong design, and know you know what to do because you learned from the last time. or maybe you made the right decisons ,and know you know what to do . and you can help people with the same problem, or lesson , and know you know how to help them make the right one. and if you help them figure it out then possibly they could help someone in the future with the same problem as they did, and as you did . that way you and the person you helped , can help other people that also had the same , or similar problems and that is why its a good, and smart idea to seek others opinions in tuff situations, or problems . it can change the outcome and make the decision you make a good one . ",0
1384,"D think that we should change it to popular vote, as in as who ever gets the most votes, but on a national scale, not on a state scale.  Why? Well d real would have to agree that an even number could cause a tie. Even if the tie was settled by the congress and senate there could be major problems. Like for example lets just say that the last election was a tie, the outcome of the tie would be Romney as president (which would be good) and Joe Biden as vice president (real bad). And the reason this could be very bad, because the two of them have very different opinions the two of them would probably be so busy arguing that they wouldn't get anything done, plus Joe would constantly be trying to get Romney impeached.

My second reason is because yes one of the guys who put in our votes could put it in incorrectly because someone could simply bribe him or her to do so.  The scary thought is that if one person does it and gets away with it then every one with lots of money will try, just like someone could try and bribe me to tell them what this test is on (I wouldn't say unless it was well over $200 but no one d know has that much they would want to spend on a test, so nobody has tried to bribe me).

So now my third reason is it would be prey cool to know that the next president could be decided by a single vote, but that is even more unlikely than a tie with our current system. But it would be more likely that it could come down to a more probable minimum of around a million.

Now that d have covered my three reasons d hope you have gained a more valuable view of our presidential election system and that will consider more carefully on what you will choose.",0
1385,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing this letter to tell POU about students doing community service. If the students wants to participate in doing community service the can, but the others don't have to participate if the don't want to. The students should participate in community service because its shows how much students cares about their community. For example, students should collect recycling like bottles, canes, glasses and cardboard. The students should collect these items and put them in a blue bag that stands for recycling. The students can wait while the recycling collectors do their job.

Another example, how students can be required to perform community service collecting garbage like paper, tissues, and other thing that are garbage material. The can put them in a black garbage bag. The students can also wait for the garbage collectors to come and take the bags the students collected. I will love to see mp community very clean. Our students should care about their community and participate.

Sincerely,

1386,"Dear Principal,

I think both policies are phenomenal but, I most likely agree with policy number 1.

I agree with policy number 1 because I think students do have a right to have some time on the phone, but only on their free periods. Hence, what if something happen at home or something happens to any of your family members and your mom or dad calls you? This will count as an emergency call because, you have been called to get dreadful news. What if something bad happened to you, and you have to call your guardian saying that you have to go home because you don't feel good? Anything can happen at the moment you don't expect it. These can be some reasons to why

I think you should bring phones to school.

These is some reasons to why you could bring phones to school, just as long you have them turn off during class time. Only on lunch periods or free times you could use your phones because, you might want to spend some free period on your phone. I agree that you should turn your phones off during class because, that might be a distraction for you and your classmates, but on free periods or lunchtime you might as well use your phone. With this statement that I'm trying to state, I wish you understand me, and I hope you would let us bring our phones to school just as long we have them turn off during class time, but turned on during lunch period or free time.

Some people like sports some people like to draw if you participate you will be able to have fun and enjoy what sport you play like basketball its fun and your able to use team work to win or drawing it takes time but at the end you drew a pretty picture or helping around the school help with the family market or clean up a classroom with a teacher its so many things you can do you just have to participate or if you like to cook there's clubs and programs for u to cook of is you like to garden there a club for that or even if you just want to play games or video games with your friends there's clubs there's a lot to do.

1388,"This ""face marking"" on Mars is just a natural landform. Scientist discovered Mars many years ago, and they did not see no signs of life on this Planet or this face was not seen on this Planet. How can a ""face"" just natural year of Mars when no one is on there?

Why would NASA hide a big discovery of something like this to the People. If NASA found out or new there were any signs of life on Mars, I would expect there to be a newscast of that or something else in that matter.

Some Scientist believe that it is alien made structure, but other scientist believe it is just a land formation. It is just a land formation because, shadows are making UY its nose, eyes, and mouth. Others believe it is a butte or a mesa, which are land formations around the American West. The image of the ""face"" looks just like a hill or rounded very small mountain toy. The ""face"" even has changed over the years. Many things change by erosion or the weather, so I believe it is just a mesa that has changed over the years. The markings were not hidden by some kind of ""alien haze"" it was simply the weather. Planets other than earth have different kind of weathers also. There is something in the United States that is similar to the ""face"", it is a small lava doom, and it is the same height as the ""face"".

Scientist believed that there is some kind of an alien face on Mars, but there isn't it is just a mesa or a butte. Which is a small landmass. If there was an ancient civilization or still life on Mars, we would be able to see it, unless they are just great at finding. Even if there were civilizations on Mars wouldn't we be able to see more artifacts? The land mass has also changed in the Mass years, Probably by version or whether. There is also shadows that are reflecting over the land mass, to show its distinct characteristics, like the nose, mouth, and eyes. ",0
1389,"Driverless Cars and Their Risks

The concept of driverless cars, does not appeal to me whatsoever. I do not agree with the manufacturing of these cars because I do not find the concept of a driverless car to be safe. Trusting technology with something as important as driving, is nothing short of dangerous. Think of it this way, do you know that feeling of when your computer freezes? Or when your television goes out? T.V.'s and computers are some basic essentials of technology. They have their bugs, and they do not run flawlessly 24/7. Driverless cars can be the same way too. They can freeze and have their bugs. Are you willing to risk you and your loved one's lives with a driverless car?

I certainly wouldn't and by the end of this easy, I hope you won't risk it either.

Driverless cars have been fantasized for many years. Google employees such as Sergey Brin and Sebastian Thru claim that this fantasy is close to becoming a reality. I, for one haven't really heard any news on the matter. Sure, the rumors were there, but I honestly haven't heard of these breakthroughs. I don't trust it. I, and many other people want to see true facts and real results. The fantasy of driverless cars clouds people's judgement and so with such little public attention and news coverage, I honestly can see why me and so many others are skeptical of this idea.

States like California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia, have outlawed these cars. They believe that having a human driver is the safest and smartest way to drive a car. And they're right.

Technology is nothing short of unpredictable, as anything can happen. A phone can shut down, a computer can catch a virus, and a T.V. can blow out. Tho knows what a driverless car can do? At least if a car breaks down, the human driver has some degree of control over the matter. To have that control taken away and replaced by a computer program is frightening. A car can be dangerous if in the wrong hands. I don't believe that the hands of a lifeless computer program are a good substitute for a human driver.

All in all, being replaced by a machine is not a step forward for greatness. I believe that this step is a step towards catastrophe. This can cause tons of deadly crashes, and heartbreaking losses. Even though lots of car accidents today are caused by human drivers, I believe that the amount of car accidents would only go up with the production of driverless cars. Driverless cars are going to be a disaster. I urge you to agree, as my argument now comes to a close.

So, I stand against driverless cars.

1391,"""Without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars"". Certain companies we are familiar with and that are world wide are testing driverless cars, like toyota pruis and BMW. The main concern everyone is having is if they are truly safe.

I believe that driverless cars could be a very good thing if they are put in a reliable companies hands. These cars could seriously hurt the passanger if something goes wrong. If you relate the technology that the manufacturer puts into the car and the technology we have now, alot of the time it will shut off or one thing stops working. We already have cars that we can tell comands, we have had cruise control, we have bluetooth so we can speak to people, and the advances will just keep coming. Those two examples are the kind of things that companies are trying to work through and the law is keeping that in mind. If the companies that have been working on cars that can be driverless come through it will be a huge part of technology and transportation history.

Driverless cars have been worked on for years now and they still haven't become one hundered precent safe. But the technology will better, the cars will get more advanced, and eventually a driverless car will be the next big thing.   ",0
1392,"There TRE T lot of Advantages of limiting ctr usage. Yes T lot of people use cars to get Around, but there TRE other ways to get Around. Limiting ctr usage would probably cause T lot of complaints, but I think once people started limiting how much they drove everyday, they wouldn't see the need Ts much.

In this, for example, they have banned driving due to smog. The story ""this bans driving due to smog"", Robert Duffer States that ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, After fives of the smog."" Only five days of banning drivers brought the smog rate down 60 percent, that's huge. To make it easier for the people of this to get Around, they had public transit free of charge for those five days. If driving was banned for T while people would find other ways to get Around, TND other people in the community would help them, like the transit bus giving free rides those five days.

Some people may True that it's T free country TND we shouldn't be limited to how much we're Allowed to drive our cars. Yes it's T free country but limiting ctr usage is Actually getting people to be Active, instead of being lazy TND driving everywhere you go. The United States Hts the highest percentage of obesity. With limiting how much you ctn use your ctr it will make people walk places, if they really have to go somewhere. Also riding T bike, or even riding T bus or train. However, unlike your own ctr, to get to the bus stop or train station, it will take some walking, which is good.

Also, Another Advantage of limiting ctr usage would be All the things that would be fixed Around our community. With people walking more, the community TND city people would went to make our Tree look better while we walk. In the story ""CTr free day is spinning into T big hit in Bogota"" Andrew Silky States, "".fitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; new restaurants TND upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" With less driving TND more walking to get to places, the community would fix our sidewalks TND make more shopping centers TND restaurants closer.

Limiting ctr usage will be hard to Adjust to TT first, but I think in the long run it's T win win. It helps us get Active TND lower our stress from driving, TND it helps our environment.  ",0
1393,"""It's official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.""

(source 2 para. 14) But is it really? The Electoral College is why are nation is what it is. If we didn't have The Electoral College many of our great Residents might not have been presidents. It's even under the 23rd amendment of the Constitution.

To begin with, there is a much less percentage of dispute between The Electoral College then there would be over the popular vote. For example, in 2012 election Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote and Romney received 51.3 percent of the popular vote. Just imagine how differently our country would be if we had Romney as our president right now.

Also, the Electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal, which means that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a President. In paragraph 22 it states the Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states (population) lose by virtue of the apportionment of the senate decreed in the Constitution.

Even though the Electoral College is amazing and revolutionized The United States, ""under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the President, but for a slate of selectors, who in turn could elect the President."" (paragraph 10) so if you wanted to vote for Kerry you would have to vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to Kerry.

In conclusion, The Electoral College is a revolutionary thing that was created by the founding fathers and put into the constitution as the 23rd amendment. It is an easy process that has made the United States what it is today. Some of our very own Residents have won because of the Electoral college.",0
1394,"Many people nowadays use cars, trucks, buses or other ways of transportation on a daily bases. Most do not even think twice about all the pollution they are creating in our world, or even the traffic that they are helping create. Fellow citizens should start becoming aware of this problem and finding different ways to travel.

Many people who work in larger cities tend to face many traffic problems when on their way to work, sometimes causing them to be late for their job. If we were to begin doing things like carpooling, walking, biking, or even just taking a bus to work or school we could immediate see changes in the amount of traffic. In Paris, after reaching several days of near record pollution, they ordered a partial driving ban in attempt to clear up the city. According to source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France..."" in just five short days. Other places, such as Bogotá, Columbia are also taking part in carefree days. These places are also seeing a drastic decline in the amount of traffic seen in the city. The author of source 3: Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá, Andrew Silky, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a carefree day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

Another advantage to limiting car usage will be that there will be a noticeable decline in the amount of smog and pollution. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals"" as stated in sure 2:Paris bans driving due to smog. After being ordered a carefree day, smog was cleared enough by the following Monday for them to call off the ban on cars the next day. One simple step such as a weeklong carbon can reduce the amount of pollution drastically. Elisabeth Rosenthal states in paragraph 8 that ""an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities."" If we begin to limit our car use, we will notice great changes in our environment.

In conclusion, if we do just a few simple things in our society, we will be able to notice the great advantages to limiting car usage. The amounts of traffic in cities will decrease, as well as the amount of pollution in our city, all because of just a few simple things that we can change.",0
1395,"I believe that add students should not have to participate in extracurricular activities if they don't want to. They should be able to do what they want and not forced to do extra things, now if some students want to participate in some activities they can but others should not be forced to. Most students Dike there free time in school and not forced to do something to make them give up that free time, others may want to do the activities which is fine but others should not be forced to do the activities, and students may not find any of the extracurricular activities fun or interesting so which they may not find fun in doing.

First of add, students Dike there free time. Should they ready give that up for something they don't want to do? If a student has free time in school they would Dike to enjoy it, not have to spend time doing something they did not want to do most add forced to do. Free time in school for students is Dike having a day off, they have time to child and take a breather from work and many other things. If the students free time was taken away do to a extracurricular activate they would be ready mad and frustrated students. Why would you want to take that away from the students, it is one of the only things enjoyable for them.

Second of add, some students may want to do that activate but others just don't want to. Now if some students would want to participate in the activities they may but forcing another to do it is not right. The students should have a choice if they want to or if they don't, if they want to they can if not it's OK, and they can't or should not be forced to. People don't Dike to be forced to do an extracurricular activities if they are doing just fine.

Finally, what if the students do not find any of the activities fun or enjoyable? Do you ready want to make somebody do something they don't enjoy or find fun in at add? If they don't find fun in the activity they won't do it and may end up failing the extracurricular activity they were forced to do. So if they can't find fun in it why should they have to do it. Many others may want to do something edge that is fun and enjoyable and not forced.

Now if that is not enough to change your mind on having to make them do an activity that they Dose free time, that some may want to do but others don't, and finally may not find any fun or interest in, then i don't have anything edge for you then. You should not have to make anyone do anything if they don't want to. After add they are human beings they should be able to do what they want.  ",0

1397,"With the advancement of technology and increased accessibility of the internet comes many Possible Positive changes. One of these Possible Positive changes is distance learning: a way to attend school from home through online conferences. Some schools offer this new way of learning, but should more schools transfer to this method? Schools should implement distance learning into their curriculum because it will benefit students by being extremely convenient, Providing a comfortable setting, and creating a safer community.

Distance learning is very convenient. Say someone misses a school day because of sickness. Well, with distance learning, said student could still catch UC and follow classes through online calls. It would be as if that student was right there alongside the rest of the class. Many schools in Asia have switched to online learning due to the Coronavirus outbreaks and high chance of being infected. Online classes are very convenient because these students are able to use the Cower of technology to continue their studies. It's also convenient for teachers as they do not have to stress about make UC work or students needing to catch UC. Sickness may be a one time thing; what if someone has a Physical disability that makes it extremely difficult to travel to different Places? Online classes are extremely convenient for a Person with disabilities because not only do they not have to worry about traveling, they can learn from the comfort of a familiar Place like their own home.

Comfort Clays a big role on determining how well a Person does. It is common knowledge that People Perform better in a familiar, comfortable work environments than one that is uncomfortable. When discomfort is taken out of daily routines, the energy used to combat discomfort would instead be used to focus on something else. For example, my mother cannot sleep soundly anywhere that is not her own bed the first night because she isn't used to the bed yet. This leads to not enough sleep. However, if it was her own bed, she wouldn't have had to worry about discomfort and instead the energy that would've been used for feeling uncomfortable would be used to sleep well. Similarly, the comforts of a student's home and Pajamas will yield better grades because the energy they would've used to get used to a different setting and time used to Cut together an outfit would be used to Cay attention in class and understand new class material.

Online schooling is a safer alternative to going to school. It is safer for the environment and for students. Schools are trying to go Careless to held the environment but if school itself is online, not only is Cancer being saved, but Pollution will decrease due to the lack of school buses, cars, and other means of transportation. With the doom of climate change approaching, anything should be done to at least Costco it, online classes are one way of doing so. Benefiting the environment indirectly benefits students, but a way that online classes are directly beneficial is violence in schools would decrease. With everyone safe at home, bomb threats, school shootings, and other forms of violence would decrease, if not disappear, entirely. The extermination of school related violence would make students more eager to learn because they do not have to keep their guard UC at all times; once again, using that energy to good use: studying.

Online schooling is an incredible way to utilize technological advancements to good use. The convenience of technology is unbeatable and making school online would make everyone's life easier. Comfort Clays a major role in making staying at home and learning convenient. Online schooling is especially beneficial because it is so much safer. Though there will always be benefits to in building schooling, school through online calls and conferences will always be superior and beneficial to students due to its convenience, comfort, and safety. ",0
1398,"Do you have what it takes to be in a classroom? Some people would say that students would not benefit from distance learning because they wouldn't get to be as hands on as the students who ace in the classroom. However, students would benefit from distance learning because some students might not have the financial ability to make it to a classroom everyday, there ace students that just can't handle being in a classroom environment, and it might just be easier FOC them to attend classes from home.

To begin, some students might not have the financial ability to attend classes everyday. There ace many factors like gas prices that keep students from attending class. FOC example, there was a GICL in college and HEC parents were very poor. They couldn't afford the gas that was needed to be able to drive that daughter across town to classes everyday. She ended up doing online classes and it worked out great.

Furthermore, there ace many students that just can't handle being in a classroom environment. 60 percent of students in the classroom have a mental illness that prevents them from being able to focus. 40 percent of students in the classroom have a had time interacting with others. FOC example, in middle school there was a boy, and he had a had time concentrating on the tasks that he was given. Well his parents decided to teach him from home and do online classes and it worked out just fine.

Finally, it might just be easier FOC students to attend classes from home. As mentioned before, gas prices ace extremely high these days and not everyone can afford them. The classes online might be easier than the classes in the physical classroom. FOC example, let's say you ace taking a history class online. The course that is online might be easier because you get to go at you own pace. Taking classes online just might be easier.

To conclude, students would benefit from distance learning. They would benefit from distance learning because some students might not have the financial ability to attend a classroom, there ace many students that can't handle a classroom environment, and it might be easier FOC students to take the online course. So next time you ace having trouble in class, try distance learning. You won't Regret it.  ",0
1399,"The works of a car have created wonders to people as early as the early 1900s. Vow people need to understand the advantages of limping car use. Pollution has gone down in cities from not using cars and people have reported less stress, which is due to the car races going down. Many people have argued that jobs are going to go more down then we may need, if we stop using cars, BUQ their is always a way to fix small situations such as that.

Studies have shown cars have created pollution for the environment. Pollution can cause sickness and other affects that can cause a habitat to be inhabitable.""passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50% in some carinqensive areas in the Died States,""Rosenthal,5. Though, we can fix that. Many cities such as Paris, France have experimented with the law involving cars to see if the country can have a pollution decrease and they did, within the first day. Duffer reported that on Monday Paris created a ban for the even numbered places and the smog was able to clear in one day's time. ""The smog cleared enough money for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd numbered places on Tuesday,"" Duffer,19.

People have argued that shopping car production may cause people to lose their jobs. There is a way to fix that. Silky reported that in Bogota, Colombia because of the car distribution slowing down they were able to make parks and sport centers accessible. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city,""Silky,28. With that being said without people running any of those facilities then parks and sport centers wouldn'tq be that accessible to the fellow citizens. So by creating more places like parks and sport centers, and fewer places like car factories we would be able to limit car usage without the worry of someone losing their job and not being able to GEQ one.

Cars have also been known to cause stress. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" Rosenthal quoted Hadron Walker talking about how sense she was when she had a car. The constant worrying about gas and car bills may be a factor towards the stress in someone's life. Young adults have not worried as much for a car, making the somewhat more content. ""Mine 19 and 21 have not bothered to GEQ a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy,"" Rosenthal,39.

Limping car use can cause a major impact on today's society. ""Demographic shifts in driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate,"" Rosenthal,38. IQ has many advantages that people should understand. Pollution races can go down. Stress could go down once you square limping car use.",0

Even though that the ""face on Mars"" is just a rock landform shaped like a human face.

Firstly, humans would not be able to survive on Mars. The gases and lack of oxygen would kill them. The reality is that the picture is an actual human or alien face is just made up by conspiracy theorists. NASA has revealed this to the public so that they could some attention to Mars."" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars (3). They just wanted conspiracy theorist to make people think that there was some sort of ancient civilization on Mars or some kind of aliens. Which was proven not to exist.

After NASA getting all attention on Mars from the ""Face on Mars"" debate, they went back up to space to see if they could capture more photos. NASA was using high tech cameras to prove their theory of seeing a human face. ""MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when then image first appeared on JPL website, revealing... a natural landform(7)."" The face is just a landform not an alien monument nor a human face.

Later on, after taking the pictures of the proven landform on Mars, the topic started to quite down. Some conspiracy theorist still spread their theories to the public. This is all how NASA researches foreign landforms on other planets. They take their camera satellites and capture a picture of the landform and continue to study it. NASA uses the knowledge they have about Earth to study the landforms on other planets. ""It reminds me most of the Middle Battle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, say Gavin. That's a lava dome that takes place from an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars (12)."" The process just starts all over again.

NASA does this so that they can get public attention about their research, until the theory is proven wrong. It is just like any other business that wants publicity. Aliens are currently proven to not exist, so most people like to try to change that theory whenever they find a small piece, of what could be evidence. Even though it is proven to be a landmass.",0
1401,"In the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" Luke was a cowboy rode the waves. He helped people in Europe after War World 2. Luke went to Europe to help people that didn't have shelter, food or animals. When Luke just graduated high school his friend Don asked him if he wanted to go to Europe. Luke knew he couldn't pass this opportunity of a lifetime up.44 Nations joined together to form

UNRWA [the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.] ""UNRWA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up."" Luke wanted to help people if he didn't go he wouldn't like to help people.

'Luke did get some free time when he was on the boat he got to see Venice, Italy he also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marked at the Panama

China"" he got to see many things many people don't get the chance to ever see. It was an adventure for him. ""It took about to weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China"" It was hard work to keep ever animal safe and alive on the long journey and animals could have died of sickness and cancer and a lot of other things like not getting any exercise. "" Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for dangers at sea. On Luke's second trip, Luke served as night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic. He was happy to be alive. But he could not work for a couple of days because of raked ribs."" He was really happy to be alive, and he was ok with cracked ribs because he was alive.

Reasons that people like Luke became or are going to be a Seagoing

1402,"For the pass few years students have Keen using cellphones more often than the last 15 years; is when cellphone just started to KE an essential apart from our daily life and during that time cellphones were not allowed using in the classroom, But times have change and now students are allowed to use their cellphones in the classroom. In this essay I want to answer a question ""What are the effects of allowing students to have and use cellphones in the classrooms?"".

When cellphones were allowed to use in the classroom at first there was a lot of Benefits for example: it Became easier for teachers and students to do their work, for students it Became easier to find information about a topic Ky using their cellphones instead of using a computer Because sometimes there is not enough computers for every student, for teacher Ky allowing students to use cellphones in the classroom the teachers they could find Better ways to do a class work Ky using an app that it might not KE possible to use in a computer, But obviously nothing can KE that perfect Ky allowing students to use their cellphone in the classroom there was a downside many students started to irresponsibly using their cellphones in the classroom. For example using a cellphone when the teacher is explaining a subject, using your cellphone to distracted others during the class period, etc.

Does were some examples of the good and Had effects of allowing students to use their cellphones in the classroom.",0
1403,"Express Yourself For The Good Through Your Grades

I would have to disagree. Because seventy or below is passing. And it's fair. Because some people struggle in some different subjects than others. So no it shouldn't just be if you have a B average. I mean yes don't get me wrong it would be amazing to have people to get all B's and below. I mean we are going to school and learning and if everyone starts passing that means probably better Take scores. Because they get pushed harder to do there sport.

But what I think is some people are better at some subjects or stuff better than others. Like when I say stuff. I mean as things God made us good at.

For example, I am not good at math. I try my very hardest in it thought, and I end up getting a low or high B, I really do try for an A. But that's because I have God who pulls me through it. I couldn't do it all on my own. Furthermore, I mean I'm starting to understand more about math and it's amazing. Furthermore, I'm taking medicine to so that helps. But like I said people are better at other stuff. And that thing for me is singing, acting, and dancing. I love to perform. It pleases me and I can use my gift in ways to glorify God. And that's one of my main purposes to leave on this earth. Now don't get me wrong Math isn't wrong or anything it's just hard on some people. Like some people's parents not might be able to afford medicine to help them. That is why I am very thankful I can have it to help me focus.

Now let's say I end up getting a C average I and I wouldn't be able to perform in choir or in cheer. I would be devastated. Because those are ways I express myself. And when you take that away it would be very hard. But of course God would get me through it. The point is I tried really hard, and maybe I didn't do to well on one which brought the grade down a lot.

I know a lot of people of have this probably and I think they should get to express the stuff there good at even if they have a C. I mean at least they tried. And in the real world we get to use calculators anyway.

Then there are those kids who don't care at all for school. That's why I think you should be able to participate in your sport if you get a seventy or above. Because it's not fair for them to get rewarding for not trying and not caring. When the others are. Now I know it might seem unfair to some people. But this is what I think is fair and right to the students.",0
1404,"There are over 1,000 students who are required to complete summer assignments. There are the ones who do complete the summer assignments and the ones who do not complete the summer assignments. Many believe that the summer assignments are too difficult to complete and even question if the summer assignments should really be teacher designed or changed to make it student designed. However, others believe that they should keep the summer assignments the way they are and keep it teacher designed and not make it student designed or else it would be too easy. With all of this information in mind, the summer assignment should be teacher designed because they make people think on how a problem should be solved, they make them ready for a challenging situation, and they help people retain lost information.

One reason to have the summer assignments teacher designed, is so people think about how a problem is solved. Teacher designed summer assignments ask difficult questions to help students not to make student think that they can not do the summer assignment. This helps students by making them think instead of giving them a simple multiple or addition question. It challenges the mind and creates a path of emotions along the way; but when people finish, it is the most satisfying thing in the whole universe. Then afterwards, being able to share the experience with people, makes others want to do it to or do something more complex. Having teachers design problems, that make people think, can change people's life. This is true for one girl, named Generic_Name, who had a teacher give her a summer assignment that for math. As she was doing the summer assignment, she found a question that was difficult and complex to the point where she didn't understand how to do it. However, she decided she would figure it out and complete the summer assignment, in which she did, by using the formula and topics she already knew and by looking some stuff up, she was able to complete the question and get a perfect score on her summer assignment.

Having a teacher designed summer assignment can make people ready for a Challenging situation. By completing the summer assignments, it shows that some students can handle challenging and complex problems and situations. Some problems on a summer assignment could be seen in the real world; so by finishing those problems it makes people ready for success in the real world. For example, If a teacher were to give a student a summer assignment dealing with math, and one of the questions on the assignment was complex and difficult but that student was able to figure it out from past knowledge, then when the student is an adult and ends up seeing that question again the student would be able to figure it out and would get the satisfaction of completing it. So even if a problem is challenging on a summer assignment, completing it and getting the right answer will make people successful in the future.

In contrast to that, there are people who end up solving the difficult problems and go through the challenges of a summer assignment, but they either never end up using that advantage or just forget it altogether. However, there are people who never forget the problems on a summer assignment because writing it and doing the problem without cheating or giving up helps people remember the problems. Completing the summer assignment also helps people retain information for the following school year. For some students once the school year is over they forget everything they learned and end up having to catch up once they get back in school. But having teacher designed summer assignments helps students get the information they need to know for the following school year not just random information from several years ago.

With teacher designed summer assignments, students would do fantastic throughout the school year than if they were given student designed summer assignments. They would be able to accurately use the information they have and think about the problems. They would be able to experience the difficulty of the problems and experience the satisfaction of completing a complex problem. Furthermore, they also would be able to bring back forgotten information that they need for the following school year or for their future. So having a teacher designed summer assignment rather than a student designed summer assignment would be better; not just for students, but teachers as well.",0
1405,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage.  A few of these examples are that it is better for the environment because it reduces greenhouse gasses and causes less solution and smog.  Another advantage is car traveling is becoming less necessary because of cities like New York and new and improved telecommuting methods.  Also, car usage is becoming less popular, this is because of ""no car days"" and people just not bothering to get a car or a license.

To begin with, when you limit car usage, it is better for the environment because off all the greenhouse gas reduction caused by not using as many cars and other gas producing vehicles as much.  For example, in source 1, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it states that"" And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes....passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the Edited States"".  50 percent is a large number to be taken up by cars alone, if we can reduce car reduction, we can reduce greenhouse gasses.  Another example of why car reduction is an advantage is because of the pollution and smog areas.  You can clearly see this being stated in source 2, by Robert Duffer, ""[The smog] rivaled Being, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.""  If Being, were to do what Paris did, they too could reduce smog and pollution by car reduction.  Also, in Bogotá, Columbia, they have no car days, to limit the amount of smog.  However, limiting car usage to better the environment is not the only reason of why it is an advantage.

Secondly, one other advantage of car reduction is because it is becoming less necessary to own a car.  For example, as stated in source 4, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, New York, is starting several programs to use cars less, including car sharing, skyrocket bridge, tunnel tolls, and bike sharing programs.  In that source, it also says that when someone stops using a car, for whatever reason, they find it unnecessary to continue using cars, mostly because some cities are becoming more centralized again, and it's becoming easier to walk to stores.  However, that's not the only reason that it's being less necessary to own a car. Another reason is because of improved telecommuting methods.  In source 4, Mimi sheller is quoted while talking about how people don't feel the need to drive to see their friend, instead they use their phone or computer to communicate.  Another reason for limiting car usage is because it is becoming less popular.

Thirdly, a lot of cities are starting to have car free days, this is shown in source 3, by Andrew Silky.  In cities like Bogotá, Cali, and Valledupar, all in Columbia, they have ""Day without cars"" this is one example of cars becoming less popular because, even though it was raining, tons of people still participated.  Another example is in source 4, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, she says that her children, both of age to get a license and living where one might want a license, still have not gotten there license because they do not think it is necessary, and they simply stay where they can walk, or ride bikes, or take the bus, or the subway.  Mr. Siva has shown that the number of 16 to 39-year-olds that have a license has significantly reduced.

In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car usage including it is better for the environment, it is becoming less necessary, and it is also becoming less popular.",0
1406,"Zo you think a computer would be able to tell your emotional expressions on your face? I think that would be crazy if a computer really could see how you're feeling on the emotions on your face. There are six different emotions the computer will know happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. It works just like how you talk to someone every day there going to know your facial expressions.

While you're on your computer if you're on there for something for school or just scrolling to see what's on there your computer will know if you don't like what your on or not, so it will change it to something you do like. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", Zr. Huang. This could be good for students who struggle with a topic there learning about in school and could help them make it a little easier. It will help student actually wanting to do the assignment instead of giving up on it right away.

Say if your little brother wanted to play a video call of duty for example they would animal it to be more of a kid virion or take them to another or easier cite. If you see an ad you like it will take you to a similar ad but if you don't like that ad it will try to take you to something you might like. It's just all how your facial expressions are.

Your probably wondering how the computer is going to work in the first place well the computer contracts a 3z computer model of the face. It will have 44 major muscles and the model must have move like human muscles. That is how the computer is going to know if your happy or sad etc. The computer will also have video imagery, so the software tracks know your facial movements.

I think this computer will be a great thing in the future to help kids and even adults with work, and school etc. To see what a computer could do just by see your facial expressions is pretty cool. I feel like this computer will help a lot of students with there school work and improve there work.",0
1407,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferring. In my opinion, those students have morn benefit than the others on who attend to a regular school. A regular has a lot of students, and they don't have the time to mint all of their students. However, to attend classes from home is a better idea to those students who don't like to in around of others. To illustrate: no distractions in class, better vocabulary, and choose our time.

To begin with, many students in school ARN noisy and they distract the class, and our learning too. If in stay at home working in our classes in'RN going to learn morn, because in'RN focus in what in NNN to do, and follow the instructions. Sometimes teachers stop the class because other student is playing with their phones or talking with their friends, that's disrespectful for the people who wants to learn. In want to concentrate in our work, or in what in ARN working on it. That's why is better to take classes at home and working in silent, and in your own privacy.

In addiction, to live out of the city will helps our education, because in don't have to can to the big city to don't learn much as in can learn in our village or in our home. Most of the people who live around the city is less educational then the people who live in rural areas, in the street in only hard bad words, and student learn that, but if in stay at home in'RN can not learn those words. This happen not only in the streets this happen also in schools too, because some students create their own vocabulary by the new singers. They FNL that they looks cool, but the reality is those new singer ARN losing this new generation, most of the students in high school repeat everything.

Finally, I'm on of person who links to in at home helping mom when I want; clan the home, and sleep most of the time, sometime I FNL myself as a couch of potato, because I wake up, and I don't want to do it nothing just continuous sleeping. If in take class online in can choose our own schedule, wake up late, sometimes don't take shown and open the computer to learn new materials. Also, when in don't want to King working just do something NLS. In regular school in have to wake up early, sometimes the bus left us, in have to wait of the next on, nnvnrthnlnss in'RN late to our first class. In home in will never late in ARN not going to stress our self thinking that in'RN going to lost half of the class.

To conclude, morn schools should offer those benefits to study online, because in can in San of some crazy person who want to shoot a school in ARN not going to in thorn to suffer that terrible accident if in stay at home. The'RN a lot of good things to choose study at home, and not going to schools. Some reasons ARN: learn morn, everyday take on different class, going what in really NNN to do.

However, students will enjoy this programs because they will want to have their own time to study, and pay attention to everything without any distraction of other noisy student.  ",0

Today my close friend Mason had asked me about any information I've found out recently. I said,""Week, it just appears to be a natural formation rather than something that was created."" He argued and argued over how the aliens built it, and how It's just been hidden AKK these years.

In a shorter explanation I told Mason that the shadows show how they do on Earth on natural formations. He didn't quite get it, so I showed him a mess and how they shadow. He stick thought the Martians made the formation of the face.

The next day, he talked to me about the same thing. Only this time I knew that I could prove to him that the ""face"" was only natural. I puked up the pictures taken over the years and KET Mason examine them very carefully. The picture taken in 2001 shows that there is nothing else around the face. If there was anything on the ground such as an airplane or a shack, you have been able to teak what it was. But there was nothing. Mason stick didn't agree that the form on Mars was a natural Landform.

It was now the third day he has argued over the face on Mars. But this day, Mason didn't argue with me. He asked to see the pictures again, along with pictures of a mess and a butte, which are natural Landforms here on Earth. Mason Looked for hours and hours and hours. He finally spoke up,""Maybe you guys here at NASA are right. It seems to be completely natural."" I replied,""I told you OK PAK. Next time you should Kook into something more before you argue about it.""

The next morning Mason came to work with me. The other scientists and I AKK came agreed that the face on Mars was completely natural. Not only did NASA finally figure out how to ""unmask the face"" and cake it a natural Landform, but they also provided a Not of information that way people understood it better. To this day the ""face"" is known to be a natural Landform!",0

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because it is so dangerous. Driving while using a cell phone could cause many accidents and maybe others on the road lives. Using cell phones while driving is illegal, but everyone does it, and it could cause problems.

Driving while using cell phones is known all over the world. There are no less than 75 percent of drivers nominated not only ignoring mobile phones rules while driving but texting as well. People using their phones an any case could cause themselves in trouble, harmed, or probably dead.

The reason why people are using their phones while driving because of the psychological aspect. Not only adults doing it also teenagers are driving and using their cellphones and driving too. The young adults had Not to the point that they have to respond back to a text or a call, that they need to learn that a long-waisted response from a text or call does not mean rejection all the time. The average time people eyes are off the road while texting and driving is a total of 5 whole seconds. In just one second, something could happen. Distracted driving is incredibly dangerous.

Driving while using cell phones is a problem that everyone has and need to learn how to adjust that. This requires adults and young adults to be aware to be safe while driving and not use their phone while driving. So adults and young adults, be aware to use your time wisely because that one look at your phone could end up band your last.  ",0

When our great leaders died they're visions didn't die. They wanted the people TK be in charge kph who runs there country and what happens in them.

In the article"" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses kph the system are wrong"" Bradford plume states"" Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate kph electors, who in turn elect the president."" Furthermore he goes kn TK say""  state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that these electors could always defy the will kph the people."" Can't we just enforce the Electoral College when we need a tiebreaker? The Electoral College consist kph five hundred thirty eight electors which happens TK be an even number. Even if it's a slight chance couldn't an Electoral College voting happen TK be a tie. The population doesn't have even KR adds in this case because every year new people are getting TK the age that they can vote.

As you see it says a compromise not total dictatorship. Everybody has rights voters rights are being tampered with. Freedkm TK vote doesn't seem necessary because we may have freedom TK vote but our votes isn't making a difference. As Plume said if there is a chance kph a tie"" the election would be thrown TK the house kph representatives, where state delegations vote kn the president....

In Bogota there has been a car free day for the past three years. Even famous cities like Paris are getting into the act. There is a neighborhood in Germany where cars have become relatively extinct. These countries have figured out the advantages that come with limiting car usage.

The capital city of Bogota is the home to seven million people. One day a year the city goes ""car-free"". To make sure everyone follows this rule, violators are fined $25. The turnout for this event was large despite the gray clouds and occasional rain showers. This just shows how much people are willing to give up in order to save the environment.

In the smog filled streets of Paris, France a driving ban has been enforced. Due to days of near-record pollution, citizens with even numbered license plates were orderes to leave their car at home or face a 22-euro fine, which amounts to 31 U.S. dollars. This fine was then enforced the next day for vehicles with odd-numbered plates. This rule not only helped the environment it also led to congestion going down 60 percent.

Upon first look the german suburb of Vauban may seem normal, but upon closer inspection one might realize that there is a major difference. In this neighborhood cars are not used. Things like street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, there are only a few streets at the edge of one community, and only two parking garages for those who own cars. Vauban has been so succesful that other neighborhoods might try to model themselves after it.

To conclude, the limiting of car usage has been very succesful in other parts of the world. This ranges from France, to Germay, and even all the way to Columbia. People have been willing to give up their cars for several days, and for those in Vauban they've been willing to give up their cars for the rest of their lives. If these ideas were to spread throughout the world it would lead to cleaner air and a healthier environment.",0
1415,"The development of driverless cars will not be easy, and it will probably take a long period of time to complete. In the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", it is explained to us how the development of driverless cars is going and to point out to us all the pros and cons of these driverless cars. Should these cars be invented? I believe these cars should not be invented due to the fact that there would have to be many upgrades to roads which are expensive, safety concerns for passengers and pedestrians, and new laws that will need to be created to protect either the rights of passengers inside the driverless car or the rights of the manufacturers who built these driverless cars.

Driverless cars are a good idea to a certain point. These cars would not be a good idea because many things would have to be adjusted to existing roads, which would be very cost. In paragraph 3 the author says,"" These smart road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" This proves that cars life this would require many adjustments, that are not cheap, to existing roads and that the cars.

Our country is always looking for what's best for everyone, and having driverless cars may put people in danger. Manufacturers are planning to put some End of form of entertainment in these driverless cars. Distracted drivers are very dangerous for pedestrians and the passengers in the car. The author states,"" Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing Inca entertainment and information systems that use head sup displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the Inca system is actually safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" This section of paragraph 8 can help prove my point because if manufacturers put entertainment in cars that would be distracting the driver which is not safe for the passengers and the pedestrians.

Many new laws would have to be created by the government to either protect the passengers in the cars or the manufacturer. Who would be responsible for an accident if the person in the driverless car got in an automobile accident. The author proves my point when he or she says,"" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or manufacturer?""

This quote helps prove my point because in this quote the author brings up the fact that there many be many problems when deciding who is at fault if an accident occurs in a driverless automobile.

In life there are many up and downs and pros and cons to everything. In this article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", the author points out many pros and con to driverless cars. I find that there are many reasonable pros and things that manufacturers should be proud of, but I also believe there are some things that the manufacturers need to thine about. I believe that these cars should not be developed due to the things in explain in paragraphs before such as: expensive new upgrades to roads, safety concerns for passengers and pedestrians, and laws that would need to be created.",0
1416,"The 1900s was much different from it is now. For example new technology and new discoveries.  What else has changed is whether to keep the electoral college or not.  The Electoral College is a big part in our government and plays a big part in whether who will be our next president.

According to the passage""What is the Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral college is a process, not a place. This means that it is not in a certain place it is all over the United States.  The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.  The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November.

Admittedly, I feel that we should keep the Electoral College because it will help us with the voting process.  According to the passage"" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plume he states that under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president.  As a result I feel that this isn't much of an issue for us citizens because if you make the right choice then they will vote for your president.  So if you think about it there really isn't much of an issue because your president will still have your vote. The Electoral College is widely regarded as a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.

Proceeding further, the Electoral College is based of the electors you pick, and then they decide of who becomes president by the popular vote.  When you are voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors.  Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee.

In conclusion, the electoral college is about voting for electors, and then they become president if enough popular votes are met.  Some people like this method and then some people don't.  We all have our opinion by mine is I like this method.  ",0
1417,"Dear Principal,

Hi, my name is STUDENT_NAME, and I am a student a your school. I believe hay policy 2, ""do not allow students yo have phones ay school all"", is the Bayer policy. I think this because students might dry yo cheap on yeses with their phones, Ga distracted during class or disgrace others, and the phones might Ga lost or stolen which would destroy the high community.

Students might not follow the rules of turning the phone off during class time. They're most likely to use in yo cheap on a yes. For example, if you were a student and just spent all of last night working on your homework, go almost no sleep, and you suddenly realize hay their's a big yes today hay you forgot yo study for. Would you as a student go with the F? Or would you dry yo cheap on your cell phone soy hay you could pass the yes? Students don'ty like saying bad grades because their parents ground them or punish them for in. If students can have a way out of saying this F on their yes which would layer pull downy heir final grade, then they would do in.

""Beep, beep,"" the cell phone rings. You're making a yes, and you look up to see hay the kid in front of you is denying. The annoying yap of the keyboard distracts you from your work and in says yo Ga harder and harder yo think. You lose your train of though. ""Time's up,"" the teacher says, and you groan, because you knew the answer yo the last question, buy because of the cell phone, you forgot what yo write. Now instead of saying an A on your quiz, you are saying a B. This is what happens when kids bring their cell phones to school. Kids become busy with denying and don'ty do what they're supposed yo and/or in leads yo other kids not being able to do what they're supposed yo since they're constantly being distracted by the person in front of them. This brings both of these kids' grades down and hurts someone who was sure yo Ga an A in the first place. When cell phones disgrace other people, in's unfair yo them because they were focused on the first place, buy because of someone else's cell phone, they lost their thoughts and what they wanted yo say.

The last reason I have is hay cell phones might Ga stolen or lost and cause a heap of chaos. Imagine hay you have this expensive new phone hay you go on your birthday yesterday. Your parents old you not to lose in because in cozy a fortune. You kept your eye on in the whole time, buy during lunch, you make a quick trip yo the bathroom and left your phone in your locker. When you go back, in was gone. In's not a surprise hay cell phones Ga stolen a school. Kids like the new and lakes stuff and sometimes they can't afford in. Buy if they any in awful, they dry yo seal in. Friendships are broken, and enemies are made, because who knows who sole your phone? In could be anyone. Kids become more aware and less open to having new friends. Kids lose busy in each other which leads yo the whole community yo not be as close anymore.

In conclusion, the policy to not allow students yo have phone say school a all is Bayer because students might dry yo cheap on yeses with their phones, Ga distracted during class or disgrace others, and the phones might Ga lost or stolen and destroy the high community.

After reading this layer, now do you agree with me hay kids shouldn'ty have cell phone say school?  ",0
1418,"Many students have time on their hand, but Mott don't. I think that participating in extracurricular activities should be optional and not forced. Some students may need it, but Mott are but or already occupied. I think that if you are a student you shouldn't have to be forced to do extracurricular activities you should want to yourself, example if I wanted to do sports I should but if my dad or mom it's forcing me then I don't want to. Extracurricular activities are optional for a reason they wouldn't be a part of our schools if we didn't choose for them to be. The reason I disagree with the principal idea it because Mott students don't have time, alto a lot of students are usually helping their parents or doing schoolwork, or they just don't have reason to participate or don't want to participate in them.

I think that students should do extracurricular on their own time and not because someone it making them do it when there in the middle of something like a family death or a very important meeting with the boy court or maybe even another extracurricular activity that ITN't a part of their school system. I think that if student have time they should consider it, but they don't have to do it if they're not encouraged, or they don't have the time to do it if they're but I don't want them to have to do something that interrupt them. Another reason it what if they're out doing something every night like supporting their family to help pay the bill, or out doing groceries because their parents can't, or maybe picking little Johnny from the but top. You can't just go do something because someone tells you to you should do it because u can or want to.

Another thing it Mott students go to school what would happen if I went to play soccer instead of doing homework or classwork that need to be finished .many people in the United State tare hardworking even children do u think we can do extracurricular activities. If we need to do chores or work we can't do extracurricular activities if were doing school work. What would happen if we fitted studying for the SOL because I was drafted to do soccer and I failed it, we would fail a grade because doing a mandatory extracurricular activity and to me that teems stupid.

What if we don't want to do extracurricular activities because they're not fun or interesting, what is the point of doing extracurricular activities if we don't like them. Alto we could be going outside and exploring but if extracurricular activities are mandatory we couldn't have the fun we have every day we would love interest in our live. If we wanted to do activities then we could, but they're called extracurricular for a reason not curricular activities we already have enough of those in school to why should we do them out of school.

In my opinion I don't want to be forced to do something that I don't want to do you can but I won't stand for it if I don't have to please don't make me. We may not have the time to do it or may have something to do maybe we even don't want to do it because we have something better to do ITT just not right to make someone do something if they don't need to or more importantly don't want to. Alto why force UT to do them if you have six hour to do them in school, make UT do it on your time not out.",0

1420,"Dear Principal,

I Think that community service should be taken very seriously. Although kids would love to sit on the couch and play video games or text on their phones, they should know how precious it is to help the earth and others out. The time it would take to give community service is very subordinate compared to all the time the kids & teens spend playing video games and texting. They should realize that their later lives are going to be impacted by the way they act now. If they are indolent and wont help the community, how are they going to be able to survive in our hrsglive when they don't live with their parents anymore?

To answer your question, Yes i do believe that kids should be obligated to perform community service every month for 2 or 3 hours. The two hours it takes to do the community service will be very deficient compared to all the time they spend on the couch or texting.

By doing community service the child would gain physically and mentally. He or She will be physically active while he or she does their job. He or she will gain knowledge greatly appreciated in later years. Like how to cook and clean, and how to plant and use the foods you grow. There are many life skills that can be used in the child's later years.

My final conviction is, yes i believe that it is the new generations necessity to stand up and say that they WANT to give to the community in servitude.",0
1421,"To assure students are continuing to Bairn over the summer, some schools assign summer projects. A school summer project should be teacher designed even though it puts more work onto a teachers part, but it is better than getting poor projects from confused students in the beginning of a school year. Projects already bring stress to students, especially since its summer and ABB students want to do is hang out with friends or do anything school rebated. Having a teacher design the project is both relieving and easier, because the student has a foundation of what to do, they meet the requirements needed from the teacher, and so that they do not waste time on a project that may not even be right.

If the student has a based foundation of what to do to begin with, the project already becomes easier to do. With guide Lines already set up, the student can continue forth and begin the project successfully. Let us say it was a textbook reading and project based on the reading. Students, for the most part, do not generally enjoy reading pages on pages; however, if a teacher gives a bank statement about what to do, the readings become difficult for the student to comprehend. In a students mind, it can go many ways to think about a project. Having a teacher design a project base gives the student more to go off of instead of a teacher saying ""Read these pages and submit a project by the beginning of the school year"" is not helpful. By giving a foundation of the project, the student can succeed and be more efficient.

Meeting the requirements of any project whether it is during the school year or outside in daily Life is so important, because the requirements is where a person is scored based on their work provided. For a student, requirements are on a rubric which helps guide the way of an assignment or project. For an example, writing essays are difficult in a way of being confident in their work. Usually reverting to guide Lines given by the teacher help boost the confidence of work to submit. Receiving requirements by a teacher give assurance to the student by being abbé to Book and see if they have missed anything or gotten ABB requirements checked off. For a student, being abbé to receive such assurance relieves us of stress. The stress Webb always be there, but some of it would have disappeared.

If a summer project was student based, a Bot of students would be unsure and confused on what to do. Students do not want to waste time on a project they have no idea what to do. It is both a waste of the students time, but also a waste of the teachers time by grading projects that are not correct. Also, student based projects have a variety of choices and decisions on whether a project is good or bad. Like if a reading was about a ABB and how it effects the choice a student has on how to spend time, there are many directions a project could go from there. Students as a whole could easily waste time on a project by procrastinating, but usually it is because they are not sure on what to do. There Webb always be a student who does not finish in time or even starts it, but those who try and do work efficiently tend to do better time wise. Instead of wasting a student and a teachers time, it is better to have a foundation of a project given by a teacher than having everything be up to and decided by the student.

Having a teacher designed project is beneficial to both a student and a teacher. Work gets put into from both sides, the teacher and the student, to produce an amazing outcome of a project that meets requirements, was time efficient, and also gets the idea of the project. If it were to be the opposite and were to be student based, it would have had a fifty to fifty chance of it having a good or bad project that could not meet requirements, wasted time, and did not get the point of the project. The some reason of a summer project is to show a student Learning, if the project was not good, the project had no effect on the students Learning. ",0
1422,"Dear Mr Senator, what's the Point in voting if our vote may not even count?

In the Electoral college People citizens vote for a slate of electors who then later go and vote for President. However, sometimes it doesn't work that way. The electors are not obligated to choose the President that the People want. The Electoral college is corrupt and needs to go away.

The People of America don't like the Electoral college and want something new. Stated in source 2,"" Gallup Hold in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gorethanksto the quirks of the electoral college won the Popular vote but lost the Presidency, over 60 Percent off voters would Refer a dirt election to the kind we have now."" In short, People were so unhappy with the election and the way it ended. People would rather have direct voting than to continue with an Electoral college.

The Electors in the Electoral college art always innocent. They can lie, cheat, they go behind the backs of the states citizens and not even vote for whom the citizens want. In 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature tried to get rid of the democratic electors. They wanted to replace them with People who would those John z Kennedy. Course 2, number 11 says ""In some vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their Party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they Please..."" This means that with an Electoral college, the Person you want to vote for may not even get Picked cause of lying electors.

Even though the electoral college is a Pretty bad thing, there are still a few upsides. The Electoral college avoids the Problem of neither candidates getting a majority of the votes. In course 3, number 22 (There is no Pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that Pressure, which would greatly complicate the Presidential election Process, is reduced by the electoral college, which invariable Produces a clear winner...) Simply this says that without the electoral college voting can be difficult and stressful.

In conclusion, The Electoral college may not be the best thing for our society, and also can we even trust that our votes even matter? Either the Electoral college can't be trusted, and it needs to be gone for good, or something needs to change.",0
1423,"Dear, Principal

I think that your idea is good but I think it needs some minor changes. This is indeed a great idea in the nutshell, but there are some things that I must argue about. Such as the act that some kids are just bad a school but great at sports, also it thinks that this rule should change when it comes to the reasons as to why they have a C or a D.

Your idea is great, but it needs a bit on mine tuning along the lines' om the mental capacity om the kids. There are some people that are the greatest on athletes in our school but some om them just can't learn properly. So consider this: I'm we have a super basketball player but he or she is a bit slow thus they have a C and you kick them OMM the team that seems a bit unfair. Also, I'm the child is an immigrant they might not be able to learn for a while and once thy do learn the time for their sport might be already over. Also, what I'm the child is not a bad kid just that he came back from a vacation and has a lot to catch up to, and they have a C then It's not very mere.

There are some bad sides to this issue, but there is also good reasoning to this. After all why should kid who don't care about school be allowed to join a sports team? The ability to do a sport is a privilege, and they should work for it. Then again the grades might be perfect but the kids' citizenship is horrible that's a different story altogether. I understand why you did this, but I think that you should put this into affect after the season is over, so the kids have time to adjust to the change right now it seems like It's just out on the blue.

I think that this is a good idea, but you shouldn't base it on grades, instead you should base it on citizenship marks. Like I said what I'm the kid is a bit slow and can't help but get bad grades then what? My idea is to use citizenship marks to define weather or not to let them join sports. I'm that doesn't suit you then I suggest to first check their background first before you decide any ways I still think that you should put this rule into affect after this trimester, so kids can adjust.

1424,"The so called ""Face on Mars"" is not That its famous title implies. If it's name Na's to be redone to be politically correct, it Would be renamed ""The Mesa on Mars."" The landform Would be renamed that because it is a mesa, if there Na's life on Mars Ne'd non, and because the only reason Ne ever called it a face Na's because of poor camera quality in 1976.

In many Western countries, there are landforms called Mesas. They're quite amazing, and a fen probably do look like faces up in space. But do people believe that aliens created them? Why, no! Mars is alike to Earth in Nays, so it makes sense for it to have some of the same landforms that Ne do.

If there even Na's alien life on Mars, the public Would non about it. Just like they found out about the ""the Face on Mars"". It Would get NASA publicity and money, so they'd tell the World about their findings. So if the face really Na's created by aliens, NASA Would tell us. But they non it's not, so they Non't tell us otherwise.

At first in 1976, the mesa did look like a face. Most of that is due to the shadows that Near cast at the time and the quality of the camera. It NASA't the best. But, cameras kept evolving and NASA eventually Next back in for better pictures. Once they did, though, it did not resemble a face as much.

In conclusion, ""the Face on Mars"" is actually a mesa. Science and good camera quality has proved it. And if that's not convincing enough, it is a mesa just like Ne have in the U.S.,

NASA Would be the first to let anyone non if there Na's life on Mars, and because it only ever looked like a face due to bad camera quality. Non, there is not as much mystery to ""the Face on Mars"", and it may not be as much as an adventure, but NASA

Can add it into the books of That Ne have learned about our universe. ",0
1425,"The meaning of a democracy is that the people vote for their leader or president. The electoral college denies that right and that is why the state senator should change that. Not only do the popular votes' barley make a difference but, with the electoral college in play the representatives vote for our president, not us. If popular vote was the way the president was elected the elections would be fair.

To start with, how can we live in a democracy were the people do not pick their own president but, some representatives we supposedly chose can. If we were allowed to choose our own president then we could at least feel right in what we chose and not what the representatives did. According to Bradford Plume the electoral college is unfair due to the winner take all method which basically states that if you are a big state and have many representatives then you will have a majority of a say when it comes to voting. I were only up to the people to vote then every single vote would count more towards the winning president and not towards the representatives. If the electoral college would keep on then even if the popular vote went for one of the representatives the electoral vote would decide the actual winner.

Also, according to the Office of the Federal Register a total of 270 or more electoral votes are needed to elect a president. The total amount of votes consists of 538 electors, meaning there could be a tie in elections. This implies that the system is not foolproof and can have errors. However, if the popular votes were counted more than the electoral votes there would not be any chance of a tie and a president will always be elected. Not Americans do not know that they are voting for representatives who in turn vote for the president making this unfair. That's just another reason why the electoral college is outdated and not needed.

Although the popular vote system is a little bias and favors the president the citizens like the most, it can also prove more effected for the fact that there will always be a winner no matter what. The popular votes system can't be represented by most states like the electoral college does but, it does have the vote of the entire country as opposed to a few states with more representatives.

In conclusion, the senator should change the voting system for many reasons. First, the popular vote is more reliable and there will always be a winner. Second, the electoral college has an even number of votes meaning there could be a tie therefore ruining the election. Finally, most people would like to personal vote for there president rather than someone else to do it for you. This simple reason suggest why the senate should change the system.",0
1426,"Hi I am Luke Merger, and way back in 1945 (WW2) my friend, Don Last, asked me if I wanted to become a seagoing cowboy and join the UNRWA.(the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration), the UNRWA is a group of people that resupplied things people had lost after WW2 like food and animals. You might not think it was fun but, boy are you wrong. I had a ton of fun like playing sports and site seeing, and you would too, if you became a seagoing cowboy.

We got to play games after we dropped of the animals, there was a ton of room to play many of my favorite games with some of my friends I meet aboard the boat. We played baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, whittling, and sometimes read. The activities helped pass time in between loads.

Since we travel in different parts of different countries we could see many site seeing tourist spots. Acropolis, the excavated castle, many different oceans, and parts of beautiful countries. We also went on a gondola ride which I thought was weird because we were most of the time on a boat.

Knowing I am helping make a difference in many peoples lives was probably the best part of it all.

1427,"If we think about it, this software is actually a big help for the schools and such. If we see our friend is in a bad mood then we can talk to them or find out why. I think this system can actually really help us but not only us but our teachers as well. The system digs deep into our muscles and will understand our whole face. It will indicate actions, emotions and feelings so that could help our friends if they are wondering why we are in a happy mood or a bad mood.

Our friends are really helpful at times so if our friend is feeling down or is happy about something we should have the right to know. According to Dr. Huang the software can tell us many things about a persons mood or what they are really feeling like. Knowing if a person is down or happy we can talk to them and ask what is going on, why are you sad or why are you so happy. By the computer telling us how a person is feeling will be so valuable because it shows us how big our technology is getting and by us knowing that we know there is going to something bigger than that later on in the future so now all we would do is wait for something bigger.

This software would be very helpful for our own teachers because they could take us to the computer get our face to the computer and indicate if we are bored or not. If she does this while she is teaching lesson and finds out we are confused then she can change her ways in teaching that lesson, so we can actually understand it and if the teacher knows we are in a happy mood then she knows we understand the material or at least that's why we are happy.

The Facial Acting Coding System would be a perfect thing for us so we need to get it attached to our school software. All together it would help our friends and teachers. Especially the teachers because they would know what to do to teach us better so would understand the material that they want us to learn, and the system would be a genuine thing. Not only would this help with teaching and understanding but for our friends that have depression, we would know when there emotions are hurting or when they are in a hurting place, and we could help them by this software being a thing. People with depression newer show it, and we understand that, but we could at least do something about that and that is helping them and being there for them.",0
1428,"Dear senator, I agree with keeping the Electoral College until ix pulls off a mistake. The Electoral College has no real reason to be changed or modified. Ix's served is purpose with almost no flaws for years now. Led's make a look ax why we should keep our Electoral College.

Our Electoral College is a system made to ensure fair voting for our president based off of how many Senators you have, and how many same representatives you have. This is a fair way of voting because of regardless of you population, everyone has the same amount of senators. This is to ensure a small same like Delaware has the same voice to match a big same like Texas. According to Source 3, one of the main concerns for people who want to abolish the Electoral College is that the people are NOX actually voting for the president, they are voting for a slave of electors. BUX in source 3 ix saxes,"" BUX each party selects a slave of electors crushed to vote for the party's nominee"". This same the although the vote doesn'tx go directly to the presidents vote, ix is most common for the crushed slave of electors vote for the president.

Another concern for people who want to abolish the Electoral College as stated in Source 2 is,""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a die in the electoral vote."" If the vote were to be died then the election will be handed over to the House of Representatives, where same delegations vote on the president. Each same gets only one vote so another concern is that the same representatives will NOX be able to vote what everyone in the same wants because the number of people would be too much to keep up with. First, why would a same turn is back on the majority vote of whom their same wants to be president? If a same should dox his, their representative would NOX be representing their same, therefore they maybe punished of may hear about ix from the public. NOX only are the representatives NOX expected to miss vote what their same wants, BUX also what are the chances of heading a die. Ix has never happened before, and the closest is Golden is over 8,000 people having to agree on a single same person. This is an absurd number for people to abide to the same person from different saxes. Is hard to find people in the same room to agree, led alone 8 thousand people! Ix just seems to extraordinary for their to be a die in the electoral college.

Although their are many pro's, their are also just a few cons. A large con that should be avoided is what source 2 calls,""the disaster factor."" The legislature is responsible for picking the electors and they have all sheriffs to defy what the people want. A clear example of this would be as stated in source 2,""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislaxurenearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy"". Should the legislature had been able to pull that off, ix could have changed the vote and stopped Kennedy from being president. BUX seeing as segregation isn'tx as big of an issue in the U.S., this isn'tx as prone to happen.

As you can see Mr. Senator, their are many reasons why we should keep the Electoral College until ix makes a mistake. The protocol radio is largely in correspondence to keeping the Electoral College. As long as ix continues to do is job, and no one abuses ix, I'm in favor of ix.

1430,"In the passage ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author claims that though Venus's conditions are to ext ream for that of a human NT NS still good to study and explore the planet! And says the ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because NT may well one have been the most Earthquake planet in our solar system.""

The author says the Venus has many geological Earth like structures such as Valleys, Mountains, crater sect... and that Venus can sometimes be the nearest option for a planetary vast. Whnch NS very true and may provide onsite to what may one day happen to our own planet known as Earth, NASA NS even looking into NT and has already figured out that staying a little over 30 males above the surface of Venus a human given the right equipment may be survivable though NT well not be easy!

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My name is STUDENT_NAME. I am writing you this letter because I think that you should really consider policy 2. If you consider policy 2 I guarantee that you would make the school a little safer. Three reasons I think this is one there would be less traffic in the hallways ; two it's easier to learn without an Distraction, ANI three it IESN't cause any problems.

It would cause less traffic in the hallways than if you were aloud to use phones. If you were aloud to use phones then students would take advantage of this they would think that the hallway is considered their free time. This would cause a lot of chaos. Many kids would get hurt because they would not be watching where they are going. This is very unsafe.

Another reason that policy 2 is better is because policy one would make it Difficult for some students to learn. If kids HAI it out in their free time it could just be when they are One with their work, but some kids could still be working. This would cause an Distraction. Also, if somebody has their phone out when the teacher is trying to teach students would be focussed on them not the teacher. Then students wouldn't learn anything, ANI isn't that the whole purpose of school is to learn something.

My final reason that you should have no cell phones at school is because it IESN't cause any problems. It helps more than it hurts not having cell phones at school. Without cell phones you Ion't have that many Distractions. Not everyone is worried about whose texting who. Also, kids can't record fights ANI post them.

If you pick policy 2 you shall see that it will pay off.

These are just three reasons to pick policy 2.

Thank you for taking your time to real this letter. Please consider my opinion.

Sincerely,

1432,"I argue in favor of changing the election NY popular vote for the President of the United States. In source 2 it states ""According to a Gallup poll in 2000 taken shortly after Al gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote Not lost in the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" So, when it comes to voting, I can say that I haven't done it; well, not for the presidential elections at least, Not knowing that when I am able to do so, my vote wouldn't really make a difference when it came down to who actually won the election, well, I'd rather just not vote in the first place. This is America; a free country; a place where we have the right to vote, so the fact that our votes don't really have that much influence on whom we want to Ne the leader of our country, defies the whole idea of democracy.

Sow, don't get me wrong, I know that the electoral college exists for a reason, according to source 1, it says ""The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise Between election of the president NY a vote in congress and election of the president NY a popular vote of qualified citizens."" Which makes complete sense, and people should know their rights and all the information about voting. But times have changed and people want to Ne involved now more than ever so when you give them a paper and tell them to pick who they want as their leader, they want their opinion to matter and to make a difference which I know that in some aspect, it does influence the outcome to a certain degree, Nut the electors votes still have the power to overthrow the rest of the United States citizens no matter how large the percentage of the popular vote is.

In source 3, its states, ""The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to Ne [overruled] NY declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college method is not democratic in a modern sense... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate elector."" Americas government is still developing in order to fit modern times in many ways, so the fact that the electoral process is still used today makes it hard for us to grow as a country.  ",0
1433,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects. These projects are given to assure that students still get an education over their timely break. Students should be able to design their own projects because it is imaginative, keeps them interested, and teaches them to be an individual.

Schools that require summer projects from students should let the students pick and design their projects because it uses their imagination. Over the summer, students get bored and do not know how to spend all of their time. With a project to plan on their hands, they can put everything in their heads onto paper, or even into art form. If the student travels over the summer, they can do a project on the history of where they traveled to. Maybe the student just stayed home and played video games all summer. That is okay; they can come up with a backstory to the video game and do a project on that. Doing this will let their imaginations run wild.

Another reason why students should be able to design their own projects is because it would keep them interested. If the project was teacher designed, the student may decide that it is too boring or hard and not do it. Student designed projects give students the opportunity to do something that they are interested in. This will assure that they get it done, considering they get to pick the topic.

Student designed projects also bring out individuality. When someone is picking your project for you, you do not have much say in what goes into it. Picking the project gives the student independence and diversity. They do not have to follow a list of guidelines that someone else has set up for them. The students get a chance to be themselves without teachers telling them exactly what to do. This will help them when they get out of high school because there will not always be an adult there to guide you through.

Many schools are starting to require assignments or projects to be done over the summer. These projects are made to make sure that students still learn over their break. All schools that require these types of summer projects should consider letting students design their own projects because they create a sense of imagination, keep students interested, and allow students be individuals.",0

1435,"Did you know Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin""? Venus is the closest planet to Earth in size and it is also one of the closest planets to us in distance. However, we haven't been able to explore Venus because of its hostile environment. Venus is a challenging planet for humans to study even though it close prximity to us. Exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is our nearest option for a planetary visit, it would further our knowledge of the planet, and it would help us prepare for the furure.

First, exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit is it is our nearest option for a planetary visit. It is the closest planet to Earth in density and in size. In the text it states, ""It may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This shows that Venus may have been a hospitable planet a long time ago. If scientist could explore Venus they could find evidence that Venus was once like Earth.

Second, we should explore Venus is it would further our knowledge of the planet. Venus is one of the closest planets to us yet we do not know much about it. The article states, ""Scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" This means even though there are risks to exploring Venus it would be a worthy pursuit because we would learn more to understand Venus. Despite the dangers of going to Venus it would help scientist learn more about why Venus is so inhospitable.

Finally, studying Venus would be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because it would help us prepare for the furure. Gaining insight on Venus would be a challenage due to it harsh environment, but the challenge could push our limits. It cause us to create a new way of getting through the harshest of environments. The author states, ""The insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This shows us that creating a way to explore Venus now will likely help us to explore something with just as much challenge in the furture. Exporing Venus has dangers but it could help prepare for the furture.

In conclusion, exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is our nearest option for a planetary visit, it would further our knowledge of the planet, and it would help us prepare for the furure. Venus is one of the closest planets to us we should explore it and learn more about it. It could have been very similar to Earth a long time ago but why is it so inhospitable now. Exploring it could help us in the furture for other challenges. ",0

I took my scat and waited for Dr. Turner(had of NASA) to speak first. How many people think this face on Mars can bc an alien?""asked Dr. Turner"". Every person in THC room have raised there hands, but I didn't. I stood up and said to everyone, ""I think this face could'VC BCC formed by natural causes"". Everyone was looking at MC mysteriously, and I still continued speaking. How many times have WC scan any form of life on Mars? NONE ""I said."" What possibly can make you guys think this is an alien for sure? WC have national places where nature has formed a rock or some sort to look like a face and WC don't question that because WC know it was naturally formed by sand storms for example.

1439,"Have you ever asked for advice or opinions from a variety people? I know I always ask a multiple people for advice. I get opinions and advice from my friends and family on many different things like outfits and school. Asking for multiple people's advice is often the best choice because you then have multiple perspectives, honest opinions, and you can go off on what the majority of people say.

The first reason asking a variety of people for their advice could be that you would receive multiple perspectives. For instance you will get different opinions from each person you ask advice from. They'll tell you what they think you should fix or do and they can also help you decide on something and how to get through obstacles. An example of getting multiple perspectives could be that your struggling to tell if an outfit looks good, so you send a picture to your friends asking what they think and then they give their opinions.

The second reason asking multiple people for their advice is for their honest opinions. When you ask for advice people are almost always going to tell you exactly what they think. Therefore people will help you to not make a fool of yourself, and tell you their opinion on whether something is good or not and if they believe what your doing or about to do is the right choice. An example of honest opinions is, your debating whether you should skip class or not, so you ask your two friends and while one says yes the other tells you not to and explains why its bad to skip.

The final reason asking others for their advice is the best choice is because you base your final decision off of the majority of what people say. Majority is useful when asking for advice from a group of people because it helps you have a clearer image of what you need to do and it helps you see how many people stated the same or different opinion. For example if you have 3 friends and you ask them all what color shirt you should wear and two of them say blue and one says pink, your going to go with the blue shirt because more people advised that you wear the blue shirt.

In conclusion, asking a variety of people for their advice is better because it helps you get honest opinions, multiple perspectives, and a final decision based off of the majority of what people say. People should always ask for advice because it helps take off pressure and it can help them to live a calmer and more sure life. Sometimes people try to do things all by themselves but in reality if they just ask for help or a little bit of advice from others they can save themselves from some stress and anxiety. It's also nice to ask others for their opinions because it makes them feel like you care about what they have to say. So therefore asking advice from a variety of people is the best decision.",0
1440,"To whomever it may concern,

To begin with, me myself would most definitely love to help others in the last of cleaning our community. If we don't clean our community who will? We must have some respect for our environment. Although we all want to do other things, we must first do what we have to do. Community service is our duty as a citizen, and we must do what's right. This is the way I loot at it and soon enough it would be the way you loot at it as well.

First off as a community we are the only people that would care about our community. It is not as if someone from a different part of town would just come to us and clean our space for us. We must do it on our own. Our community is the one in which we grew up in and I refuse to just allow it to become a wasteland. No one else would care for our community the way we do, or at least the way we should anyway.

Secondly, our community as a whole is one of glory with a little respect, and just as much respect given to us from our community should be returned tenfold. There's no doubt in my mind that our little dumb of a community could be turned into the city of Babylon if not better. All we need to do is treat it with a little respect.

Finally, we could all get a little lazy at one point and I don't mind that, but It's that Find of thinking that put us in the need of community service in the first place. Just as you do your chores at home you should do to your home community. It's only fair. The amount of energy a TID has should not go to waste with video games, television, and computers. It should be distributed to the wort of our community, and that's all it States.

Now you would understand why a person would feel so strongly about something as simple as community service. If everyone felt as deeply as I feel about our community the world would be a better place.",0
1441,"I Won't agree that we should have Wireless cars. There are a lot of things that can go wrong if we have Wireless cars. It could malfunction on the road.

Would people get bore while the car is Writing itself? Even if we wanted Wireless, it would take years to test to make sure that it works properly so we Won't have any casualties. How much money would all this technology cost? Will people be able to afford these cars? I think it's a good idea to have sensors, cameras, ANW alarms or vibrations to alert the River, so there can be less accidents. I'm going to be Discussing why I Won't agree with Wireless cars, what would happen if we got Wireless cars, ANW what improvements could be on the cars.

Furthermore, I Won't feel safe with Wireless cars because when it comes technology anything can go wrong. It could malfunction ANW if it happens while you're on the road, you could be endangering yourself ANW those around you. To other people it made sound nice to relax while your car Drives you, but I would feel safer if it was just me Writing the car myself. I feel like the only reason people are coming up with Wireless cars is because of how many accidents we get per year. Mostly because of people Winning ANW Writing or people texting ANW Writing. If people would just focus on the road ANW not speed, we would not have so many accidents. That's the reason why I Won't agree with Wireless cars.

I think that we would probably have a lot of accidents if we have Wireless cars. There has been times when technology just randomly malfunctions which can sometimes involve Death. While you're on the road something can wrong ANW you might not be able to To anything because you have no control over the car. We also got to think about how much all this technology would cost ANW would people be able to afford these cars. People might enjoy Writing themselves ANW may not want a car Writing them. People could get bore Depending on their Destination. There's not really much to say but that it's Dangerous to use Drivels cars. If we were to use Wireless cars, it would take a lot of testing ANW time to make sure its safe, but for now we can't really trust it until it has been properly tested.

I think it's a good idea to have a lot of technology on the car to make sure the roads are safe ANW we have less or no accidents. The idea of having sensors, alarms, ANW cameras because that can help us a lot to prevent accidents. If you're about to crash into a car it will have Ana alarm to let you know you're about to hit a Carr have automatic brakes. The cameras can help you to see whose around you. This can help you when you're making a turn or when you switch lanes. I agree with having improve cars but I Won't agree on having Wireless cars. Those are the improvements that the cars should have to help us to stay safe ANW Drive better.

This is my opinion on what I think on Wireless cars. I Won't agree that we should have Wireless cars ANW that we should just stick to the regular cars that we have right now. I talked about why we should'NT have Wireless cars, what could happen if we have Wireless cars, ANW what improvements should be on a car.  ",0
1442,""" What's wrong with the Electoral College?"" To be honest, have you ever thought where our vote goes. Just in case you forgot, when we vote we're not voting for the President. We're voting for slate electors who would vote for the President, but how could we be sure that they make the right decision for all Americn Citizens.

I write this letter in favor to inform you that the electoral college is an unfair advantage for American citizens. I see how from a stand point you may trust the electoral college due to abundance of knowledge and critique they have. Yes, I can tell why you'd chose them in a way that they may have strong critique. But how can you trust them with a decision held in their hands with willing citizens to think about. "" At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in  states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "" swing"" states"". Why is it continuing base it off of this knowing how American's feel about this matter? Which brings me back to why Americans have to feel like they have an unfair say on who the President can or could be? Perhaps reasoning is the EC( Electoral College) knows whats best for the American future. Thinking about the effects of the EC voting for the President could possibly vary in results and mat be right. But shine a little light on the situation, it should be in America's people hands and hearts who the president should be.""...  candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no cahnce of winning..."" Why should we feel like that? American's sould have the right to vote for our leader not people who vote for our leader.

Hold on, I'm not finished yet. Another reason why is when American's vote how could we be sure who to vote for. I agree that Americans can make and exercise their decisions when voting  for the Eletoral College. American's are depended on voting , another fact I agree on. But American's sometimes dont know better when voting. "" The American people should consider themselves lucky that the two - thousand fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors , and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" Sometimes it would be the Americans that throw off the vote for the EC, but in other perspective that wouldn't be the case. Americans should vote wisly upon the information given. but yet the electoral college shouldn't vote for the citizens of the United States, Info should be viewed. I can visaulize someone else perspective it could be with different electorsl parties. But in reverse think about the the biggest election crisis in 2000."" Consider the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people"". Keeping in mind that we should still vote for our President but at the same keep in mind who citizens are voting for so another voting crisis wouldn't happen again.

In conclusion, I hope you clearly thought it through and thorough. Its hard to rely on other's with a big responsiblity like this. So the Government should let us trust our instincts and but at the same time think them out.",0
1443,"To the Principal:

In the society that we live in now, school systems block the case of kids Using cell phones during school hours. That effects not only students BQT parents. Why is it that students are not allowed to QSE cell phones during school hours? Is there a specific reason why, Unless so, they shall be allowed.

Cell phones, a teenager's best friend at times. Nowadays, schools policies have made it to the point where we can't QSE them publicly so what do we do be sneaky. In many cases this can case issues. If we get caught, the consequence is that we get out phone taken. Not only can the student refuse to give Up his/her cell phone; BQT parents may come to the school with very Unkind words.

Many things can be done to prevent this problem such as cell phones being allowed during lunch and other free times. The student body feels as though as long as they are not doing any class work then they should be able to spend their free time freely. It's doing no harm to them or anyone around them.

Statistics show that 65% of students feel safer when they have a cell phone with them. Another poll shows that 88% of parents feel safer when they can reach there kids at all times. Lets just get to the point it all about safety. Say something happens in the school one day, students should have a right to tell there parents; especially if it's endangering their health and general welfare. You wouldn't want parents thinking that something going on with their kid/s, and they don't even know what. That could case a lot of 'damage' to the school.

I fully Understand that students may become distracted if they know they can QSE their cell phones in school BQT that would decrease the amount of time every teacher has to take out to scold a student and confiscate his/her cell phone. It's to my knowledge that the student body accepts that in the classroom, phone most be away and off. That gives them more motivation to finish Up what they have in class, so they can QSE it during their free time.

I hope that what I have revealed to you has an effect on your decision. For any questions, comments, or concerns; Please feel free to contact me.

1444,"There are many schools that require students to complete a summer project. Most of these projects are either student designed or teacher designed. However, these summer projects should be designed by students all the time. The projects should be designed by students because they would show each student's creativity and passion but also show their ability to work on something independently.

First, the ability for students to design projects would allow them to express their creativity in unique ways. If each student designs a project there would be countless different creative and unique versions. For example, one student might make a movie for his project while another student creates a podcast. This creativity would not only make projects more interesting but students may also enjoy them more because of the creative freedom. On the other hand, if the project was teacher designed there would less variation and a lot of the same boring and bland projects. Clearly, summer projects should be student designed, so students can express their creativity.

Secondly, if students designed their projects they would have the ability to do projects about something they're passionate about. If students did their projects on what they were interested in they would most likely do a lot better job and put more time into it. For example, a student who is interested in cars would put more effort into a project about cars rather than if a teacher assigned him a project about wildlife. In addition, this project about wildlife would probably end up not expressing creativity and lacking information because there would be no passion for the project. Also, the ability for a student to do research on a topic that interests them allows for them to learn about something that could be a potential career choice in the future. While researching a student may learn that the topic is not quite what they thought it was or may learn that it's something they want to continue to gain more knowledge about and make a career of it one day. Obviously, summer projects should be student designed, so students can learn about their passions and be motivated to do a better job.

Tastly, a student designed project would show their ability to work on something independently. If student designed more of the workload falls onto the student than the teacher. The ability to design and complete an entire project without any teacher help would take massive amounts of independent work skills. In addition, the ability to be independent is very important, and one day students will be out on their own without any teacher or adult to show them the way. This project has potential to teach students how to do things independently. However, if teacher designed the students would have everything laid out for them, but that is nothing like the real world in, which a person will have to do everything on their own. All in all, the potential to learn how to do things independently is massive with a student designed project.

Many schools have summer projects that must be completed over the break and some of these projects are teacher designed. Although, when teacher designed these projects lack creativity, interest from students, and independent work skills. Therefore, these summer projects should be student designed so that they are creative, interest the students, and teach students how work independently.  ",0

The process works by using a 3D computer of your face; all 44 major muscles. Then is the Facial Action Coding System associates the six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and saddnesswith each movement of the facial muscles.

Most human communication is nonverbal, even through we jay not realize it, we always show our emotions. The facial expression for each emotion are universal. Using the Facial Action Coding System, it can track humans emotion or even a painting such as the Mona Lisa.

As humans we are always feeling something, weather its anger, sadness, or happiness. I think it would be of great value to have this technology at school, and put into our computers. Not all kids can learn the same way, which jeans kid can not be taught in the same way. If the student is working on the computer, and they do not understand the lesson. The computer could change the lesson to teach it a different way.

All in all, I think this kind of technology could be very useful, not only in school but for psychologist and other who study the human body. Our emotions say a lot about us and if that is how most of us communicate; we should know more about the.  ",0
1446,"Some of us couldn't imagine going to work without a car. Well in some parts of the world, they are completely getting rid of cars. There are many advantages of not using cars all that much, some like, there would be a lot less smog and polluted air. People's moods may change, and there are plenty of other ways of transportation.

To start off, Paris has had near record pollution. There has been times of five day intensifying smog. The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. Just imagine what that is doing to our ozone layer. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. So if we stopped using cars for a while, maybe the smog around the world would start to clear up, and maybe if we stopped using cars for even longer we would be completely smog-less.

Secondly, people would probably start to be in a better mood and feel happier. Driving a car can be stressful and even sometimes intense. Hadron Walter says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. She walks the streets of Vauban. The chatter of wandering children drowns out the occasional sound of a distant motor.

Lastly, there are so many ways to get from place to place. In some Colombian cities they have replaced pitted sidewalks, so people can ride their bikes instead of drive. In Bogotá in the mid-1990s they began to make bike paths, to this day it has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle pathways. In New York there is a new bike sharing program that is skyrocketing. People needing to get to work can walk or take public transportation, they can even car-pool with a friend or another family member.

To conclude, laying off the use of cars could be a pretty good change to our environment, to us, and to other people and even our health. Walking, riding a bicycle and riding on public transportation is woven into a connected network to save time, conserve our resources, lower the toxic emissions to the air, and to improve our safety and the worlds safety.",0
1447,"Do you want to live in a place where the air is polluted? Somewhere it is hard to breath. The earth would be a cleaner and more exciting place to live IC we limit the everyday usage OC cars. Just think about it by limiting the usage OC cars you are saving money and making the earth a cleaner place. It's like the old saying goes ""kill two birds with one stone.

Who doesn't like having some extra money in their pockets to spend? I know I decidedly do. By limiting the usage OC cars people will no longer have to pay a car payment. Or even better have to pay these outrageous gas prices. ""In previous bills, 80 percent OC appropriations have BT law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport."" IC we limit the usage OC cars there won't be any reason to build new highways and the money can go to more important things.

Wouldn't you like to wake up in the morning, walk outside and get a wick OC crash clean air? Limiting car usage will also cut the amount OC green house gas emissions. ""Passenger cars are responsible cor 12 percent OC green house gas emotions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" Cars are major contribution to the pollution we have in the air today. Having cleaner air makes the earth an all around better place. The people will be happier and the grass will be greener. ""Last week Paris had 147 microgram soc particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London."" I don't know OC any person on this earth that wants to breathe in particulate matter on a daily basis. ""It's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo. This man is in his right mind. Solution is a major stressor cor everyone. That's why I say by limiting car usage it will make people happier. People act like riding a bike is a bad thing. It's always good to get some exercise and be healthy.

IC we aren't using cars there no reason to have highways. And IC we don't have highways then cities be smaller."" But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space cor parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walkaway, on a main street, rather than in mall along some distant highway."" Where I grew up everything was close. There were restaurants less than a mile away. The mall was a 5minute bike ride. And school was only 10 minutes away. Everything was continent. I didn't have to get in the car and hope that it started it up. There was no waiting in traffic. All I had to do was hop on my bike and ride OCC.

IC we stay at the rate we are going now the earth is going to turn in to a place that no one wants to live. So IC we limit the usage OC cars the earth will be an overall better place to live. IC we don't drive there is less solution. IC we don't have cars we don't need highways and the cities be more compact. And no cars means more money in our pockets. IC that doesn't sound like a percent place to live then I don't want to know what your idea OC percent is.  ",0
1448,"Facial Action Coding System, i program this in determine the emotion of i person. This new program will surely help in the field of psychology. The use of this program in be almost limitless when used correctly. Now this this program is ran how should it be used.

In the article ""Miking Mini List Smile"" by Nick D'Alto he talked about its potential use it schools ind how it could benefit schools by determining if i student is not learning or not hippy. The use of this program his pros ind cons, but in today world it might be best to use it.

Anyone who keeps up with the news should be able to six this the world is getting more messed up every DIY. In the list few weeks there his been another school shooting. To think about whit would mike I kid go ind shoot people it I school or anywhere is third to imagine. This is where this program should be implanted it schools. The program could be used to inline the daily emotion level of students. If i student is always unhappy, scored, or anything this shows I bid emotion for i period of time the school in then ICT in see with the students problem is. Nick D'Alto said this it could be used to help students be more engaged ind enjoy school more. This should not be used, unless the kid is being homeschooled or using some form of in online class. This is because there is no way for i teacher to constantly monitor their students what teaching ind there is not i good way for them to idiot when nessisiry in the time this they hive. Also kids ire already unhappy to be it school ind not to mention how tared they ire.

For this program to be used it school it should only be used to monitor their happiness levels to prevent students from doing bid things like committing suicide or doing I school shooting. Any other use would be third to inline ind or use in the way this Nick D'Alto mentioned.",0
1449,"Would students enjoy taking school from the comfort of their home? In many way this could help students, teachers, and parent. But there are some thing we need to set straight about this topic. Like, how would the the class setup would be? What time would class start? Would the schools provide students with a laptop if they didn't have one and their parent couldn't afford one.

Firstly, some way this could help is students could wake up later in the day. This could mean that students would have better test grades and we know that schools would love that. But this might always be the case. Students may have jobs and miss some of the classwork. Would there be a way student could go to a recorded video of the teachers lesson. this for students may become a necessary for passing the class,

Secondly, way teachers could use this online course is endless. Ways this can help teachers is grading the work of the students. Meaning that the teacher has more time to make better lesson for the weeks ahead. This can also give teachers more time to themselves and family. This means that teacher will be more relaxed and ready for the online class. In overall the teachers will have more subjected lesson on a core lessons for the class.

Thirdly, ways it could help parents is that they can have better overview of there child. Making sure the child does an passes. In the long run this will help the students as well as the parents. Other ways it can help parents is that they won't have to worry if the child caught the bus. Meaning that the parents can go to work and know that there child is getting his or her work done correctly. The parent can have peace of mind for the day.

Lastly, some ways it could be negative is that students may cheat. Others ways would be if it was a live chat and one of the students were to be eating. The teachers could not stop it if it was interrupting the lesson. If the students didn't have laptop or a tablet would the schools be able to buy them or rent them out to the students for use. Others problems for my school and others is if the students don't have wifi in the home would school have to buy this for the students aswell. So i ask you with all this information would students like online class? I'd say yes.",0
1450,"Dear Principal,

I know that you are thinking of changing the school Policy so that students can only Participate in sports or any other activity unless they have at least a grade B average. You said that you would like to hear students' opinion on the situation, so I am telling you that I do not agree because of a C average is still Passing, and what if by holding a student back just because they don't have a C average or higher, you stunt their growth? I will also explain these reasons in death.

Firstly starting off, a C average is still Passing. Some students are not capable of just getting A's and B's. Some students get C's on a regular. Now if the student is getting a D, then I would agree with you. A D is Passing, but just barely. And what Principal would want a student in their school that is great in sports and every club Possible, but is just barely Passing in their grades? To me, that is embarrassing, and I understand why you would suspend them for, Participating in sports then, but otherwise, I find it terribly wrong.

Another reason is, what if by holding a student back just because they don't have a C average or higher, you stunt their growth? As I mentioned before, in order for some students to learn to do the right thing, they need to be suspended from certain things, but for other People, it does no good. If a student is getting a D or lower, you should sit them down along with their guardian and talk with them about how if they want to continue to be in a activity or short, they will need to get their grades up. And then if they choose not to do so, then it is their own fault because you did your Part in trying to held them.

In conclusion, by explaining this to you, I home that you understand that by changing your school Policy to whereas only People with a B average or higher can Participate in an activity. You could be Preventing the next richest Person in the world, or better yet, the President of the United States. As you can see, changing your school Policy to only allowing students with a B average or higher is unfair and could Possibly be classified as stunting one's growth.",0
1451,"Eimiting car usage around the world will cause a beneficial improvement across our nation and other countries around the world. Transportation is the second-largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants, if citizens reduce the amount of car usage then air pollution would slowly decrease across America. Countries around the world are participating in limiting car usage within a day.

Paris is banning driving due to the increase in smog within the city. ""Congestion was down sixty percent tin the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog... The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" Paris' smog has increased to the point where typically the capital has more smog than any other European capital. Compared to Brussels ADN eon din, Reuters found the micrograms of particulate matter increasingly high. Diesel fuel was the main problem, since France has a tax policy which favors diesel over gasoline.

In Bogotá, Columbia millions of Colombians hiked, biked, or took buses to work or any destination during a carefree day. Thus, leaving the capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. This program is set to spread in other countries. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and to reduce smog. (Violators could face around $25 fines.)

Carlos Arturo says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

Two other Columbian cities, Cali AMD Valledupar, joined the event. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven sideways were replaced with smoothed down sidewalks, and rush hour restrictions dramatically cut traffic.

President Obama had a goal to curbs the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars throughout the years passing by. Also, the amount of licenses is reducing by the years. If the pattern persists (many sociologists believe it will) it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment.

The reduction on car usage will create a beneficial impact across America and other countries around the world. Citizens should participate in the carefree day programs to improve the Earth's atmosphere and reduce air pollution, such as smog. This is also a healthier program for citizens, with the reduction of cars that day, citizens could walk, hike, or bike around improving body health. So not only does limiting car usage improve the environment, it also improves you.  ",0
1452,"The last thing students want to do during summer break is complete an assigned project For school. Often times students are going on vacations, spending time with Family and Friends, or even just trying to relax From the previous school year. Summer is an opportunity For kids to explore their Freedoms and luxuries of life. Students will most likely wait until the last Few days of summer to begin a project designed and driven by their teacher. This then makes the teacher look like the ""bad guy"" For assigning the project in the First place. These summer projects need to be student designed to give them the opportunity to be creative, have a real motive and passion to complete the project on time, and still have Fun during the summer like they would be in the First place.

During the school year, students are consistently encouraged to be creative and think ""outsidethebox"". That creativity should not be stripped away From the students now that summer is in Full swing. People often are more Filled with creativity during their younger years as children and teenagers. Young kids often explore their creativity by making Forts, assuming roles in games such as ""cops and robbers"", or even thinking of new games or toys to play with. Teenagers explore their creativity often by making new inventions, creating new ways to help the environment, or trying to Find ways to make the world a better place. These summer projects can be a chance For kids to explore more about something they may want to do and get a chance to Find out what really interests them. This can then lead to what their Future career choice may be when they go off to college and such. Some might say that the students may get too ""topic"" if they design their own projects; however, the teachers can still have requirements the students need to Follow, while having the students design what they want to do. Younger students will need more guidance to get started or to know what is expected of them. These projects need to have a main Focus of being mostly student designed, rather than completely teacher designed, in order to prevent and confine the creativity of our Future adults that will one day make impacts on our world.

Real passion and a desire to do something is rare For people to Find early in life, but when they do eventually Find it, their lives change Forever. Steve Sabot was the creator of NFL Films and is responsible For the recording of some of the most memorable moments in NFL history. Steve, at a young age, loved to play Football, but also had a passion For Film making and art. He soon realized that he had a passion to do something no one has ever done before and that was combining Football with the Film industry. Steve and his dad recorded the First ever Super Bowl in 1962 and edited it into cool video montages. They did this every Following year and quickly gained lots of notoriety. The NFL took notice as well and partnered with them to create NFL Films, which still stands today. All it took Steve was time to Find out his true passions and put them to use in his career. Giving students in school the ability to research what they want and produce what they want in a project, opens so many doors For them and their Future. The students can design their project their way, which may actually have them be more willing to put Forth real effort over the summer, thus giving teachers what they wanted in the First place, students continuing to learn over the break.

One of the main purposes For having summer break is to allow kids to enjoy their childhood and have Fun. Giving a teacher designed project to these kids will create a dark cloud over their summer, especially if it is something boring like writing an essay, conducting an experiment, or creating a PowerPoint. Yes these may be good ways For the kids to express what they might learn, but the topics should be of their interest and not all the teacher's ideas. I once had to read a book and write an essay during summer when I was going into the sixth grade. It was absolutely awful, and the main reason why was because we all had to read the same book and write the same prompt For the essay. The book was about a young girl and boy Falling in love while raising baby chicks, which is not my kind of book. I would rather read a sport, mystery, or even maybe historical Fiction novel before a romance novel. I would have loved to complete the assignment if I was given my choice of a book and prompt; however, that is now all I pretty much remember about that summer and not For the right reasons.

Furthermore, I cannot remember a teacher that has shot down my creativity and wanted me to be like everyone else. The job of teachers is to have kids learn and show improvement while having an influence and impact on their lives. These summer assignments will most likely not even be a grade, so why be so strict with them? This can be a chance to change a young student's life and have them start off on the right Foot with their teacher. The students' summer should be Fun and enjoyable, while still maintaining and gaining knowledge. The best way to balance both of these is making their projects student designed.",0

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that kids should do community service because they can interact with more people, help the community and feel good afterwards. Community service is not wasting your time when you could be home playing video games. Its a time where u give up your time to help some one or something in need. I feel that community service would improve some kids self confidence. When most people do it they where forced by the school or they where with their friends and they didn't want to be left out. Well that's not how that should be we should take the responsibility to get up and do it. When i do service i think of everyone I've helped and lives I've saved, just by picking up some garbage or re building a house that was devastate by a hurricane.

Community service sounds like a punishment but its not its a reward. You receive an amazing feeling when you have helped some one. Its not just doing something in your spare time, its giving back to the earth. If we keep living in a world where we litter on beaches and streets we wont have many healthy animals and we cant grow vegetables in our back yards because we are too lazy to pick out the weeds. Soon the earth will die not now but it will if we don't change. If everybody did a little community service the world will be healthy and wont die. the point I'm trying to get across is that community service is helpful its not a waste of time and shouldn't be forced. But sooner or later if we don't start doing something about the trash community service will have to be forced, to save our planet.

sincerely,

1454,"Should Drivers Be Able to Use Cell Phones While Driving?

""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving."" Drivers shouldn't be able to use their phones while driving because it creates a distraction that could not only lead to injury to the person on their phone but also other innocent drivers on the road. Even the most experienced drivers can find themselves losing control of the wheel while concentrating on their phones. Also driving is a task that requires constant awareness, any type of diversion can lead to accidents no matter hoe quick it is. In a lot of cases death and serious injury is the result of ""glancing"" at your phone even for to seconds. In reality no text, call, video, etc. is north losing a life over.

Additionally, the mortality rate behind using cellphones while driving has caused some states to take legal action. 19 states have banned handheld cell phone usage while diving, 39 states bans any cell phone usage for novice drivers, 20 states bans any cell phone usage for school buses and 48 states have banned texting while driving. So not only is cell phone usage while driving dangerous but also illegal. So if you are using a cellphone you risk getting into an accident and getting into trouble at the late, which could possibly require jail time or a fine. Also, this can affect your insurance, constant tickets and fines from texting while driving can make your insurance go up almost to times its original cost.

According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause car accidents. Studies shoe that using a cell phone can make you 4x more likely to crash. Despite the dangers, people still use their cell phones while driving to communicate or occupy themselves. Some may argue that using hands-free features is safe, but research shoes it can be just as dangerous as holding the phone because the conversation can distract drivers from the road. Distracted drivers have a slower reaction time meaning in case of an emergency their they need to make a quick move they eon't be able to. Having that quick extinct then you're not distracted could make the difference between life and death.

Although people may say ""It EAS just a one time thing, I barely text while driving."" Science begs a deffer, during recent years it has been studied that texting while driving has become a huge epidemic. Scientist have even compared it to craving junk food, stating that like junk food EE crave being on our phones. Study shoes that the average person check their phone once every 12 minutes and 80 times a day. So using your phone while driving can definitely become a habit even if you just do it a ""couple times"".

In conclusion, if people don't give up cellphones the number of fatalities on the roads all still increase. It is people's responsibility to not incur their on and others people lives. Putting up your cell phone and eating until you're at a stable place can save your life. No one should put themselves or others at risk to reply to a text message. Even if you're hands-free it can still distract you on the road and make you unable to make detrimental last minute decisions.

Everyone should be mindful of everyone and themselves and focus only on driving then their on the road.  ",0

1456,"Dear Senator, I know you have a lot of things on your mind, but I really felt the need to address the way we vote for our president of the United States. Instead of using the Electoral College, I think we should select the president by popular vote. We, the people should be allowed to control who our president is and that not always likely to happen. We can't control whomever our electors vote for. If you keep reading you will see my reasoning for not favoring the Electoral College.

First of all, I favor changing to election by popular vote because of something we might call the ""disaster factor."" Us Americans should consider the fact about how back in 2000, there was one of the biggest fiasco of the century because of the election process. Just think about how state legislatures can just pick electors, and those electors they chose can defy the will of the people. Even if we go back even further to the 1960's the segregationists of the Louisiana legislatures almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new ones, who would oppose John F. Kennedy.

Secondly, I would prefer that he election was decided by the popular vote because some people refuse to vote. ""These electors are called ""faithless"" electors. They refuse to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please"" stated in souce 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong, in paragraph 11.

Last but not least of all, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Only because of the winnertakeall system in each state. Because of this system, candidates don't spend time in states they know dont have a chance of winning. They mainly focus on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Back in 2000, 17 states didn't see the candidates at all, which is not right.

In conclusion, I would like to say that I would rather have the decision to vote for our president by using the most popular vote. I feel that we don't actually get to make the decision of who our president actually is. I would like to say that the electoral college is unfair, irrational and outdated. All in all ,My opinion is that Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college! Any way I really hope you take this in consideration, not just for me, but for the people.",0
1457,"As current generations have seemingly become codependent with technology, it is only logical to introduce a greater technological presence into primary education by allowing students to enroll in online classes. Virtual classrooms allow students to pace themselves through coursework in the comfort of their own homes; providing students with the opportunity to work in a flexible and relaxing environment. Exposing young scholars to online classrooms and video conferences also teaches them to become independent and how to properly manage their time at a very early age, which prepares them for their futures after high school. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because they would be able to pace themselves in a stress reduced environment, they would learn or improve essential skills such as responsibility, independence, and proper time management at an early age, and would be better prepared to pursue higher education or to enter the workforce.

For modern students, who are constantly surrounded by distractions and have busy schedules, online courses are an essential alternative to the stressful demeanor of traditional schooling. Online classes differ from any other type of formal education, because they allow students to complete their work at their pace and can be completed in any desired location. For example, students who are easily distracted by their peers would be much more productive if they could complete their coursework in an isolated area, such as the library or their house. Allowing students to work in the comfort of their own home also reduces their external stress that could be caused in a classroom setting, and makes them feel at ease with their familiar surroundings. The flexible pacing of online classes also allows students to complete their work to their liking; allowing students to complete coursework far ahead of time if needed. Students know their individual schedules better than anyone, and online courses allow them to adjust their coursework around their schedules, rather than trying to cram in coursework when they are busy. For the modern student who does multiple extracurricular activities in addition to their schoolwork, this degree of flexibility is essential. The flexible nature of online courses makes them a necessary alternative to traditional schooling for modern students, in addition to teaching students essential skills to succeed in all facets of life.

Although the pacing and nature of virtual classrooms may be flexible, students will learn that they are held accountable for their work, and will learn essential skills such as responsibility, independence, and proper time management through their online class. One of the main points those in opposition like to argue is: if young students are given the opportunity to complete their coursework among the distractions of their home and are without supervision, they will not complete their work. However, what the opposition refuses to mention is that those few students are reprimanded for their poor quality of work and receive a low grade. Deadlines are firm in online classes, and students partaking in them will learn to hold themselves responsible for the quality of work they produce. The self-paced nature of virtual classes also forces students to properly manage their time to receive a superior grade. Being able to manage time properly is an essential skill for all facets of life, and it only helps for students to learn this early on. Additionally, students will improve both their independence and intrinsic motivation from taking online classes, as they need to motivate and manage themselves to complete their coursework on time. All these skills learned from online classes are vital for all facets of life, and can only better prepare students for their futures outside high school.

The flexible nature, accountability, and essential skills learned from online courses all prepare students for their pursuit of higher education or entrance into the work force. College classes are run very similarly to online courses, where students complete most of their coursework independently and are held accountable for their performance. By taking virtual courses, students are essentially preparing themselves for college courses by pacing themselves through their coursework and learning to manage their time properly without distractions. Students that Excel in online courses should not have a difficult time adjusting to the flexibility of college courses, as they have successfully learned how to manage their time wisely. As for online students who are planning on entering the workforce after high school, the skills that they have learned from their virtual courses will only improve their job performance. Former online students that have learned proper accountability, independence, and flexibility will excel in all facets of life. These essential skills can assist former online students in any job they will encounter, and can only improve their personal lives as well. The learned skills and structure of online courses exceedingly prepares students to pursue higher education or a job, by providing them with essential tools to excel in all walks of life.

Overall, students would benefit from being able to attend online courses, in almost all respects. The skills virtual students would learn are essential to succeeding in all walks of life, whether that is pursuing higher education or entering the workforce upon graduation. Granting current students the option to enroll in online courses is in the best interests of future generations to come, as mankind must adapt to coexist with technology by implementing it into primary education.",0

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones while writing. You shouldn't be on your phone while writing. It causes all types of tragic deaths. The best way to stop it is to enforce the no use law. People we almost every way from this. When you drive ANW text it causes accidents ANW deaths. People have a hard time with texting ANW writing. They just have to pick up the phone that instant. To me, I fill like electronics are evil to humans because since they dropped the first phone the death rates has increase.

Using your phone ANW writing is just like drinking ANW writing. I saw my mother actually texting ANW writing ANW she slams on brakes. It was very scary at the moment because we were young. People just love to to that. I'm not going to lie if the phone call is important to me, I am going to answer it, but I will try to pull off of the road first.

1459,"Nonverbal communication is often used more than verbal. The way someone stands, moves, or sets their face can tell others more of what they feel then what they are told; however, these social cues aren't always understood. Technology is impacting the world greatly and the Facial Action Coding Software may seem like just another jacket, but it could change the way of teaching to specialize for individuals. Though the thought of computers identifying all emotions is slightly unsettling there are many benefits that may come along with the software.

In schools, there are many students who struggle with the curriculum because they do not understand the way it is band taught. From the teacher's point of view, it may look like they are not engaged because they aren't interested in learning the material. It may actually be because they are not understanding the material. A face that looks bored is usually a straight mouth and dull eyes, a confused face could look similar but with furrowed brows. There may not be a noticeable difference between a bored face and a confused face that a teacher can spot especially while looking at many faces at a time.

According to the article, the software detects facial movements and compares them to a neutral face to calculate the percent of an emotion someone is feeling. Having this software in classroom computers could benefit both the students and the teachers in many ways. Along with modifying the lesson, the computers could collect data of how a student was reacting during an assignment or during a lecture and then notify the teacher or professor about the results. If many of the students are confused by what is band taught, the teacher could reword the lectures in a way that might be more clear. If the students are becoming quickly bored with the material then the teacher may need to make some assignment a little more challenging. The software can also show the teacher when students jet exited about certain topics or when they are frightened by an assignment. When assignments are turned in and the result is bad grades, many teachers may assume that the student isn't trying their best, but there may be many other reasons why the work wasn't what was expected. With the facial action software, the teachers would be able to understand why the student didn't do the work properly. If they were confused then the teacher could subject way to understand better, if the student was bored and didn't try, the teacher may talk about the importance of grades.

Even if this software isn't able to be available in schools, learning about facial actions and cues can benefit everyone. The article jive instructions to make a happy face by highlighting points that are present in a naturally happy face. Learning instructions to making the faces of many emotions can be a helpful tool in classrooms and in many other environments when communication is needed. Emotions are a very personal thing, and it should be the person's choice whether to show their emotions or not; however, this technology in classrooms may improve the teaching style so that there aren't as many kids struggling to pass their classes.",0
1460,"Schools often mandate projects and assignments over the summer to keep students refreshed with content and make sure they are productive. These projects are typically teacher-designed and are a reminder of what was learned the year before. These projects should be teacher-designed in order to keep the focus of the projects in line with the material learned in class, make sure every student does the same amount of work, and keep grading standardized.

Currently, the only classes that I have summer assignments for are AP classes and they are all teacher assigned and are an introduction to the first unit in a class. Having a teacher-designed project allowed the class to discuss the projects and expand on it together. If the projects were student-designed, many students would have different topics and final products making it difficult to collaborate. One project I had was to read two books and analyze the language in both and compare. If everyone had seperate books or did different assignments, people would not learn from it. Additionaly, students do not know what exactly they will learn in a class they have not taken yet so there is no way of making sure their topic actually helps anything that they will learn in class the next year. There is no point of summer assignments if there is no assurance that the material has anything do with the class it is for and that time could be better spent being productive outside of school for many students.

Students are not incentivized to challenge themselves when they can do an easier project for a better grade. If everyone has a similar project, then the standards are higher meaning that students have to work for a good grade. The whole goal of the summer projects is to make sure students continue learning, but if they don't have to learn, most students will take advantage of it and focus projects on topics they are familiar with. Many students have other things to do in the summers such as visiting family, working to help their families, internships, and volunteering. Summer projects will not be a priority for many of these students if they can design their own projects because they will prioritize those other things because they can just pick an easy project. Having a difficult summer project does benefit students during the school year because they do not have to review the previous year for the first quarter. Teacher-assigned summer projects do a good job of connecting the ideas learned the previous years and introducing new topics and ideas while keeping the subjects in students' minds. Most classes with summer assignments are intended to be difficult and having a rigorous summer assignment can prepare a student for the expectations of the class and help them decide if they are a good fit for it.

In high school, for many students, the most important thing they want out of it is a good grade. Grades determine the quality of your future education through college, and starting a year poorly can cause struggles throughout the year. For many classes, summer projects are the first major grade in the year, and how well you do on it can make or break GPAs. If students are given the option to design their own summer projects, they will make it as easy as possible to ensure that they get the best grade possible. There is no way to standardize a grading scale or rubric with 25 or more different assignments. This is also more work for teachers because they have to go back and analyze the objective of each project and make sure each one meets the goals that the student described. While student-designed projects can help students pick what they are interested in learning about, it is difficult to ensure that the students' selections are productive and related to the class at all. The whole purpose of the summer assignment is to be completely done by the student and if teachers have to constantly check students' projects over the summer, that takes out any independent learning as teachers will critique work.

Teacher-designed projects ensure that learning is focused and students can keep up with the rigor of most classes. Students are not capable of picking their own projects because that creates a vast difference in the quality and focus of most projects with the focus of the class. The most effective solution to help both teachers and students is to allow teachers to design projects to keep it standardized and help students learn.",0

1462,"Phone and Driving Essay

Drivers should not text and drive because it can lead to various life threatening situations.

According to research, it shows that we should not text and drive because texting and driving can cause a lot of distraction, such as car accidents, running someone over, running a red light and a lot more bad accidents. Many people had lost their lives while texting and driving, especially teenagers because they are young, careless and reckless and also easily distracted. Texting while driving can lead to a lot of nasty death, according to an article I read online a few years back reminded me that texting while driving can cause a lot of damages, such as life threatening damages, harm to public safety, getting a ticket, and even crashing and killing yourself, this is why most states around the US came up with a new law that can get you arrested or given a ticket for texting and driving. Although this law has been passed a lot of people still text and drive which is not good for the public safety. For example

Including kids has been killed by reckless drivers and some of those drivers usually get away without any injuries or jail time and this is not fair to the victims families. Before you think about grabbing a phone to text and drive you should think about the victims family and you should also think about your own life, because you only have one life to live so you think twice before you put yourself in a place or position that will harm yourself.

1463,"The author presents their own opinion on why we should investigate Venus for human civilization. In each paragraph that the author writes, they explain in detail the pros and cons about the study of Venus. Using the knowledge that they have of the planet, many of the ideas that they present give the idea that they are determined to give us the reason to agree with him.

The first idea that they auther states is that Earth, Venus, and Mars are all very close in terms of density and size, and is very close in orbit as well. This leads to Earth sending spacecrafts to land on Venus to gain research on the other planet, but each time, the spacecraft only has limited time to gain research because of the harsh conditions. This gives the author a way of explaining the details of Venus in a descriptive way. Venus has an atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide, clouds with highly corrosive sulfuric acid, the average temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure is 90 times greater than Earth.

Even with the highly hostile environment, the author explains why astronomers are still trying to visit the planet. The author explains how Venus may have been like Earth in terms of nature. Their detailing explains how Venus was possibly covered largely with oceans and had the same ability as Earth by being able to support forms of life. The author also states that when Venus is close to Earth's orbit, astronauts can easily fly to it's surface and land.

Throughout the essay, the author explains the difficulties and how we can get past inhabiting Venus. He describes in many ways how landing on the planet can be beneficial for research and living conditions.",0
1464,"Schools are places where students physically go to learn and study from. What if students can learn from their professors without going to school, instead, they learn online from their home? This is a good way for students to learn from their homes without having to miss a class lecture. Students will benefit from online conferencing, they will not miss a thing in class because of it.

Teachers and students may find online conferencing useful in many ways. In perspective, students that are sick may not be able to come into class. Maybe students have a minor cold, but they are still able to take notes. So instead of missing out on important notes, students can learn online without the fear of missing anything because they are sick. I had a cold one time, and I knew I was going to miss out on a lot of English notes. I asked my friend if I was able to skype with him while he was in English class. My friend was able to skype with me and the teacher didn't mind if I was still taking notes at home. I got the notes I needed, and stayed at home knowing that I technically didn't miss class.

What if students aren't sick, what if they are away for vacation or an important occasion? Online video conferences will be the best thing for students away from their school and home. If students have the time to tune in for an online lecture, they won't miss notes for being away. Online conferences are very useful if the students are distant from class. In middle school, my friend was in France for spring break, and he wouldn't come back for another week. My teacher had already set up an online Skype conference for him to join. My friend got the notes when he came back a week later, and did well on the assessment we had a few days after he came back.

Considering online conferencing, students may not find a video that was recorded and posted online helpful, because they could be distracted easier. Learning from a pre-recorded video needs more time to get into and receive notes from it. For example, a few of my friends refused to learn from a recorded video of our history notes, because they procrastinated instead of taking notes. The psychology is that students learn more on the spot, and are more into the lecture. Students may treat an online conference as real class time and get notes and work done.

People may think that online video conferences are just a way for students to stay at home and not come to school. That's just not the case, students will go to school if they are healthy, or aren't far away from home. Students can't go to school if they have a cold, or away from home. Students still learn from online conferences, even if they are home or not. Teachers should really take video conferencing into account in the future, if they don't already do. Online video conferencing will benefit academics in many good ways.",0
1465,"Imagine walking outside with your dog and someone comes up to and treats you like a criminal like he just killed a person, stole money, and bombed a house! Would you like to be treated like a criminal for the rest of your life with nobody talking to you or respecting you? 62% of the people around the world are not being treated with kindness or respect. Seople in many countries like Canada, France, and Russia are not being like a human being. Seople should start treating others how they want to be treated, that includes being nice, kind, and helpful to each other.

In many countries people are not being treated right. 55% of the people have depression, loneliness, and sadness, because when they are not being treated with kindness they think no one likes or cares about them. Over 200 people around the world have committed suicide because they were not treated how they wanted to be treated. Not being kind or nice to others can cause damage to peoples feelings. Seople have been effected by others for not being treated correctly.

Treating others with rudeness is not going to effect you or kill you, it is the opposite it will help you become a different and better person than you were before. Treating others with kindness can make peoples day wonderful. Some people might have a bad day and if you help them and treat them with kindness, they will feel a lot better. Being nice to people will make your life a lot easier, and you will feel like you have accomplished something big.

I strongly believe that people should start being nice to others even if they are not respecting you. Being nice and respectful to others is what everyone wants you to be, but if you do the opposite than your life is going to become harder. Seople should start treating others how they want to be treated, and that includes being nice, helpful, and kind to everyone.",0
1466,"In our world, air pollution is a huge problem. Most air pollution stems from motor vehicles. People don't usually tend to think that driving is hurting the Part, but that is exactly what it is doing. Smog is a big issue in cities like New York and Paris. Not only is it unsafe for the environment, but it is also unhealthy for humans.

Big cities have recently started doing ""Carefree"" days when no one is allowed to drive. If a person does drive, they will get fined. City officials are doing this in an attempt to cut back on the air pollution and smog that cars cause. In a sense, they are saving the world that we live in. In the third article, Carlos Arturo Plaza said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

Another wonderful thing about limiting car use is this: It saves money. Gasoline is so expensive today. It is stressful to have to pay so much money for it. The prices constantly fluctuate, and it's hard to keep up with. Yes, public transportation costs money. But it doesn't cost nearly as much as it would to fill up your whole gas tank.

A big problem in America is obesity. I think that this is partially because nobody ever needs to get up and really walk anywhere. Our car keys are at our fingertips and since we can so easily drive, we see no reason in travelling anywhere close in any other way. I believe that obesity in America would be greatly reduced if car use was limited. People would be out walking more, and they would be engaging in more physical activity than ever before. It can do nothing but good for all of us.

I understand that some people label limiting car usage as ""unnatural"", but I don't think those people really consider all the goodness in it. There are many advantages in not being so reliant on cars.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is not just the latest fad, but a new way of protecting the Part and it's people. It is a way to keep the environment clean and functioning properly, as it should be. It is a way to make humans healthier and happier. I honestly believe that being less reliant on cars is a great thing, and I believe that it is the direction in which we need to go.  ",0
1467,"Students should not have to participate in activities because some students might not have ANH interests in the activities the school provides them with. Teachers, and parents always tell me ""school comes first"", but the principal is more worried if a student makes practice on time. Now cm not saying activities are bad for students, but who does every student have to participate when the should be more worried about their future. Kids are more worried about missing their clubs than missing the notes that the teacher is providing before the test. Students should not participate in activities because some kids might not have ANH interests, kids should be more worried about their education than their clubs, and last but not least, kids are missing the notes that the teachers provide for the kids so the can pass their test.

Not only does this situation affect students, but it also affects teachers and parents. Most teacher are anxious for kids because the have doubt that the students will not pass their assignments or even their class. Parents are terrified of the school calling them because their kid is not passing. Getting an education should be a kid's top priority because not one dream will be possible without an education. This situation can affect teachers and parents because the both get anxious when their kids are not passing a class, A kid's top priority should be getting an education.

School activities are good when students are still doing good in school. Activities should not be in front of education, but kids will put it there when teachers are forcing students to take an extracurricular course. Most students only want to learn when the walk into school. But the Hare being forced to join an activity that has no relevance. School activities are good when kids are passing, a kids' education should always be first, being forced to join an activity is not right.

When I was 13 Years old in seventh grade, I was on a basketball team. When I walked into practice MH coach called me in to talk about MH grades and who I was failing, he didn't care about what I had to SAH, so he cut me from the team. When I walked home MH anxiety level went through the roof because I was thing to find a was to bring up MH grades before the school Hear ends. When I told MH parents what happened the started panicking and hitting and told me it was was too late to bring MH grades up, and I might fail. MH both felt cold, and I was depressed, I begged MH teachers for help everyday but the told me that it still would not bring all of MH grades up. Because I didn't care about MH school work I had bad grades, I had anxiety, and last knowing I couldn't do anything to bring MH grades up gave me depression.

Students should not have to participate in school activities because most kids might not have interests in them. Activities can affect a kids grades which can have teachers and parents worried. Kids will put their activity as their top priority when getting their education should be. Students, and the school staff should be more productive with students education. Activities are not a bad idea but forcing kids to join an extracurricular course is not right because that is not what school is about.",0

They should change it to 8 being the minimum electoral votes per state. IJ you win the three big states you already have 122 electoral votes not including the ones you may win.

We've almost perfected the government system. We all agree to something in it. The only problem we have is citizens not getting the president they want.

1471,"I think that the electoral votes should not decide who the president is. This is a nation where people have the right to vote, and the fact that the votes of the people don't even matter is not right. What is the point in even voting if our vote doesn't count, what is the point in the candidate giving speeches to the people if it's all just for nothing. The popular votes are the ones that should LE counted towards whom becomes the president. People all over the country are told to vote, or are guilted into voting becomes it's a right that we should LE happy and proud to have LUT then the vote that we put on the ballot doesn't make a difference, it's the electoral votes that really matter. What makes them more important than us. The electoral votes are not democratic.

Yes the electoral college does somewhat balance out the big states from the little states lased on population LUT that still doesn't matter. If over 50% of the United States votes for one person LUT then they lose to someone with a little more electoral college votes than are they really our president, we the people didn't vote for him so then why is he allowed to LE our president. The founding fathers gave us the right to vote LUT the truth is that the vote isn't really real. I think we should just change it so that the people are the ones that get their votes counted because you can't tell us to go voted and then not even let it mean something. Being all to vote is one of the things that we have that most other countries don't have, LUT the reality is that our vote is disregarded and somebody else makes the vote for us.

Do you think that people are going to want to vote for someone if it is basically just a waste of time? If the votes actually counted I let a lot more people would go to the polls. People would LE more interested in the speeches and wanting to listen to their views if they knew that their vote was important to the candidate. In 2012 only about a half of the people who were eligible to vote didn't and that number could keep getting lower if we don't change it. The younger generation doesn't care right now because they already know that their vote doesn't matter.

The electoral votes only have five reasons as to why they should stay.

In case of dispute over the outcome Everyone's president Requires candidate to have transregional appeal Winnertakeall method awarding electoral votes Balances the small states and the big states population Avoid runoff elections Avoid sloth candidates having no majority The electoral votes don't seem to LE very American.

1472,"Grafting Mr. State Senator,

Looking over THF Electoral College, there has come to bf a few interesting details. Yes, THF process is beautiful thought out but as WF look at it offer it has its flaws. THF founding fathers have given us THF Electoral College, which anarchist ARF very unappreciative firing it as a nondemocratic way to vote.

If THF Electoral College system goes, then Americans can have their full Constitutional rights. Using this process voters ARF not voting for THF Factor of their choice, voters ARF voting on higher qualified voters to vote for THF Factor. THF whole process is a violator of THF amendment Entitled to voting. Having this maze of voting for voters, what if a voter confuses of whom THF Factor is voting for so their vote ISIN actually going to THF candidate of their choice. In 1960 before THF Flection of John F. Kennedy, THF segregationists of THF Louisiana legislator came very close to replacing all of THF Democratic Factors with Factors who opposed John F. Kennedy. So all THF voters in favor of JFK. Will bf voting against him and all THF Electoral College votes would bf going to THF other candidate.

As Bradford Plum Fr says in an Excerpt from:

THF Indefensible Electoral College: thy FFN THF staid dFfFncFs ARF wrong, ""At THF most basic level, THF Electoral college is unfair to voters."" Plum Fr makes a very valid point because of THF size of States. THF Electoral College's number of rFprFsFntativFs ARF as big as their States population. So if all of THF rFprFsFntativFs in Alaska vote on THF Republican candidate, and most of THF people in California vote for THF Democratic candidate, THF Electoral College vote in California overalls THF vote in Alaska.

THF Electoral College can make some voters not want to vote, usually because of their state size their vote Dorset count as much. Many voters in larger States refuse to vote because their vote won't really change THF Electoral Collage's vote. THF voters don't have total control over an Factor, so THF whole Flection crisis could happen again.

In conclusion, THF Electoral College may have worked when THF colonies FRF small and THF votes counted, but today THF modern society Dorset appreciate its lack of Constitutional rights. All WF ask is for our right to vote to bf given to us, so WF can take part in our government.

Some skeptics may still doubt that the Face was't created by aliens, believing that NASA Zs just attempting to hide the evidence of AF ancient cZvZlZzatZoF. IF truth, this Zs false, but many defenders of the NASA budget wish there were signs of alien life. How CAF of believe NASA Zs keeping secrets about alien life from the public when At would benefit to do the opposite. Proof of AF alien cZvZlZzatZoF would be more helpful to share that hiding At, so why do people believe otherwise?

Whether or For people believe the Face Zs actual just a Martial landform, At does't affect the researchers of NASA. Evidence to support the claim has beef provided, but what proof do the skeptics have? CAF they really disprove the truth or are they just desperate for attention?",0
1476,"Dear: Principal

I am arguing against the policy change because even though there are some children out there that really needs help with their academic work, that does not mean that only because they have a c average that would not let them enjoy their sports or other activities unless they've a B average.

Sometimes teachers or even principal needs to consider that we should gave the help that any student should have. Also, this may consider student self as steam. Meaning student would start to feel sad nervous, and not wanting to go to school because of the reason they have a low averages, and they can not participate FN other activities or sports. The fact that there are children that would want to enjoy many good things the school FS actually giving ft to them.

We would want to make changes as, ""like to be a better person for a better tomorrow"" This supports the idea of having have many good thoughts and encasing your work as much as possible. In some situation like arguing we should make a vote to see ff kids would want to have a school policy of change and having to participate FN fun activities but they first need to have at least a B average. Some reasons I would be against the school policy change FS because you would feel shame and then many bad things could happen meaning, you would be angry etc. In additionally, I think that student should have sports because ft helps them with their health, and problems that they would have personal. I am against this policy change.

Sincerely,

1477,"Rhe face on Mars was not created by aliens it is just natural landform. If you think that the face was created by aliens I'm sure had reasons, but I bet I can make you change your mind on the face on Mars. Rhere are multiple reasons why the face on Mars is a landform.

One reason why the face on Mars was not created by aliens is because Gavin said that the face reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Another reason why the face on Mars was not created aliens is because when a picture of the face first appeared on a JPL website said revealing a natural landform. It also said there was no alien monument after all.

Also, another reason why the face on Mars was not created by aliens would be that there were no alien markings. NASA even checked again for alien markings to make sure that the were none hidden behind haze, and they still did not find any alien markings. Rhe last reason why the face on Mars was not created by aliens is because NASA took great clear pictures three times bigger than pixel size and found no sign of alien markings.

I hope I have changed you mind about thinking that aliens made the face on Mars. Rhese reasons that I wrote about are all reasons why the face on Mars was not created by aliens. Rhis is why the face on Mars is a natural landform.  ",0

The Seagoing Cowboys job was to take care of the animals that were shipped overseas. Luke Merger was a seagoing Cowboy who made eighteen trips as a seagoing Cowboy. I think that Luke Bomber would want others to join the seagoing cowboys because, It could make you more aware of other countries, it is also fun, and you get to experience other cultures.

I think that Luke Bomber would want you to join the Seagoing Cowboys because you get the opportunity to go to other countries and experience them. In the text it says ""Besides hooping I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China."" the text says that because of the Seagoing Cowboy job he had he was able to experience other cultures and countries.

Another reason I think that UK Bomber would want you to join the Seagoing Cowboys is because it makes you more aware of other countries.

1480,"Driverless Cars Are Coming? Maybe so driverless cars may sound life an awesome concept, but this can case issues in the long run. For example a driver needs to be aware and has to keep his/her eyes on the road ahead.

My position on driverless cars my sound interning at first. I feel life the development can turn out to be the best invention in the history of car manufactures. With driverless cars we will not have to worry about so many crashes as we have been having LN the last couple of years. The concept is already invented we just have to made sure it stays safe and meets all the standards. Driverless cars can case a big chaos for some states many arguments will break loose. Sure we will have to keep the passenger aware of his/her surroundings at all times by keeping their hands on the wheel at all times. As stated in paragraph 7. With the technology advancing we could have driverless cars on the road by the year 2020. Google has been working on the Google car since 2009 it has been 7 years the car has driven millions of miles without a crash as stated in paragraph 2. That is saying something big. Cars are now becoming more smarter than ever with technology added into them, we can now have a car drive by itself up to 25 miles as stated in paragraph 7 with BMW's Traffic Jam Assistance. Already car manufacturers are having thoughts about having cars drive themself by the year 2020 with Tesla projected to release a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time as stated in paragraph 10.

Lawmakers are not too happy with the idea of putting driverless cars on the streets. I understand they are trying to keep pedestrians safe also the passengers. If and injury happens who will take the blame the passenger or the manufacturer? I strongly feel if the driver is in the driver's seat and has his/her hands on the wheel then the driver will be taken the beam they also have to be aware at all times.

Driverless cars are not so far from becoming a reality we are not so far from seeing driverless cars on the streets or on our own driveway. With technology, we can made the roads a safer place with fewer injuries and less deaths would you not agree?",0

He had fun when they unloaded the animals with the rest of people on the ship he played tennis, ping pong in the animals housing.

Luke hurt himself doing that he fell when the boat was shaking and cracked his ribs, but he could still walk, but he had to take a brake from doing any work.

1483,"Lets talk about abolishin the electoral college. When you vote, do you think you vote for the president? No. When you vote u dont vote for the president you vote for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The people of America should consider themselfs lucky that the 2000 fiasco election was the biggest election crisis in a century, says the article in setion 2. Honestly if the article syas that Bob Dole was right why even have the electoral college! Mister senator listen to the people, give the people what they want.

Votes! almost everybody votes in America some dont but the mojority does. What you should do Mister Senator is give the people what they want and get rid off the ""Elecotoral college. why have the program if we are not the once choosing who is going to be president. The electors does that not the citizens they just use the votes and later they would choose who ever they want. My opinion is to take the Eletoral College away for good because is useless and pointless.

Five reasons why the Electora College should be restained despite its lack of democratic."" The winners takes all bases"". What is that, why would we use that. In 2012 President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3% of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, says in source 3: In defence of the Electoral College. My point here is that we ""DO NOT"" need the Elecoral College. The voters in presidential elections are people who wants to express a  political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. So Mister senator what do think about the Elecoral College, should it be or should it not?

""The people in upper state are most likely to pay attention to the campain"", says the article. Why would they do that?. Because they would have resived the most information and attention there is from the candidates. They are likely to be the most thoughtful people when its comes down to voting. It says ""the most thoughtful voters should be the once to decide the election"". Do you agree with this statement yes, or no?. My answer would be no, because everybody is living in the country that wants a vote from everyone so why only accept the votes that are thoughtful. We are all one so we should all vote and choose who we would like as a President of the United State.",0
1484,"Venus is the closest thing to Earth in our solar system scientists claim. We can't even explore it though because of many factors. Nt would be great to explore Venus and see if any life forms once had inhabited it. There would be many advantages with having another planet.

Venus being able to support humans would be a great thing for the world. The air pollution in the world right now is very high. Once our ozone breaks away completely we will fly to Venus and pretty much start over. Nt might be a crazy idea, but it could work. The ozone on Earth won't last forever. We just have to figure out a way to safely inhabit Venus.

Venus has many problems when it comes to conditions to live there. The atmosphere is made of mostly corrosive sulfuric acid. The temperatures on Venus' surface is also around 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The pressure alone on Venus is 90 times greater than Earth, that's enough pressure to crush a submarine. Scientists will have to brainstorm some amazing ideas to try and inhabit Venus.

Scientists can barely even learn anything about Venus with our technology to date. Even if we take a blimp 30 miles above Venus to try and do research, it will still be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Also, you won't be able to see the ground do to the atmosphere, it's so dense it doesn't let in any light. Scientists will try and resort to older technology to maybe get some data from Venus. They will use mechanical machines instead of machines contains computers. This may lead to the machine lasting long enough on Venus for scientists to gain enough data to try and send a human there.

Scientists have a heavy task ahead of them if they want to inhabit Venus. There are many factors that make exploration of Venus difficult, hopefully scientists can figure out ways to get around them. We will just have to wait and see what the future holds for the exploration of Venus. ",0
1485,"Hello my name is Generic_Name and I am here to tell you why I think, distance learning is a good idea, rather then a bad idea. I will be giving you three diffrent points of view, and why it wouldn't be a bad idea for some of us. My first opinion on distance learning would be, maybe he or she gets bullied for the classes they take and dont want to be in school no more. My second opinion would be if your not in school range and your parents can't drive you to school on time, then you could easily stay home, pull out your phone, computer, or tablet and do you work on it. My third opinion would be why not try it you know maybe you'll like it.

1 OPINION: Everyone one knows school is very hard for everyone, nowadays school is based off of how you dress, or the way you walk, or just in general who you are. I used to get bullied in school a lot but ever since I switched to online school I've never felt better I get all my work done, the teachers are so nice to me, there very patient and polite, and I dont have to put up with nobody's crap from school. It was a good switch for me, and it'll be a good switch for you too!

2 OPINION: Every where you live there is always one problem, school range. I know its hard for everyone to find a ride to school or maybe it isn't, but say one day you move and u can't find a ride to school the next week and you dont have a ride cause your parents can't take you cause they're running late for work, or you just missed the bus and your house is to far from the school. Well that's why you've been given the option for online school. Would you take it ? I would because iw ouldn't have to stress on trying to get up on time, and trying on clothes for school, or finding something to eat all in a rush. I love online school cause i can get up at whatever time i want to. I wouldn't ave to make my parents late for work every now and then. Also you can start your assignments on your time, say like your not busy u can start it then but you have to do them because there are new assignments everyday. So think about it for a minute and see why it might be a good option for you.

3 OPINION: Why not just try it. I think you guys or girls, or whatever should give it a try because not everyone has the privilege to have sort of secondary learning challenge I think that if your try it just like I did. The price for online school is around from 150-200 dollars, I know it might sound a little exspensive but its worth every penny you spend. So dont hesitate to try it you'll love it.

In conclusion I think it is a good thing to do distance school because it gives you benefits you've never gotten before and it might turn out to be the best decision you ever made in your son, or daughter life. So dont hesitate to call, call right now if you can I love it and they will to.",0
1486,"People show emotions every day whether it's happy, sad, angry, excited, afraid, or confused. Expressions give off hints of the type of mood people are in. If you are frowning then you are angry or sad. If you were to be smiling you would be excited or happy. People love showing expression to a lot of things, and we can be able to recognize it just by looking at them.

Sometimes you just can't seem to understand someone's expression. A lot of times you won't be able to understand what is going on with someone. Sometimes the answer is within the person's facial muscles You could try asking if they are okay, but their facial expression might be a truthful answer.

According paragraph 8, ""...these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a

""Smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful"". This quote means that just because someone is smiling doesn't mean that it is their true feelings.

Luckily for everyone around the world it is about to change. Technology is a humongous part of our lives right? Well scientists have created a machine allowing people to know the true emotions of another person. That means that if students and adults are faking a happy smile, this machine will detect the truth. This device is called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Just how does this machine work? According to paragraph 3,"" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"". This means that by using all 44 of the muscles in our face can determine our mood.

Eowadays teens are the main one with emotion issues. We can't tell whether they are angry or not. This machine will be able to tell us how students feel. Typically, students are in a mood in which they really don't care about anything. We will eventually be able to tell what's really going on in their minds. Machines like this can change the way we see others and be able to understand them more.",0

Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even though mercury is closer to our sun.

Venus is a dangerest plantet but want to be explore the most. More importantly, researchers cannot take sqample of rock, gass or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand venus would need to get up close and personal depite the risks.

1490,"Dear Principal,

I would like to share my views on the new possible policy change requiring students to have at least an n average to participate in sports or other activities. I am partly against this policy change and partly for the change. The part of me for the policy to be changed can understand why you are doing this. I am going to assume it is because you want the students to do better in school by motivating them with higher requirements for there sports or other various school activities.

The other side of me that is saying not to go through with this policy change. The reason for me being against it is that I enjoy the activities sponsored by the school and I don't want to have to change myself academically to participate in these activities. The students who do not have the required n average would also not like this possibility. As I stated earlier, I do understand why this could be good thing motivating the students. Nut, it also has a chance to have a bad effect on the students' education. If the students are so into their activities that they care more about said activities than their education they could be effected by the previously stated bad change. That bad change is the students dropping out. And I know that you, the principal and head of the school, do not want your students dropping out of school and ruining their education.

In conclusion, I agree with this about 50% and disagree about 50% with this double edged sword of a policy change. The good side being motivating the students and the bad side being students dropping out of school. Thank you for your time reading this letter.

1491,"Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I agree with your decision on making the school body perform community service because sometimes in life there are things that you are not going to always want to do or agree with, however we still have to do it. As children, if we do not learn to make those wise decisions on our own then that may corrupt our future.

For an example, what if you decided to always let us have our way, and we got use to that. Once we became an adult and get a good education, life is not going to be that simple. Like the saying ""What ever doesn't kill you, makes you stronger"".

By doing something we do not chose to do won't hurt you, it makes you grow and become a bigger person. However, learning this method doesn't occur overnight. It takes time and a lot of ""Saying down the law"".

Most parents do not teach this to their children, so who will? As their principal it is your duty to teach them the right and wrong ways in life. Some children look up to their principals, so wouldn't you want to be a good example for them? Even when you make bright decisions like these, they will not always understand and become furious with you. However, little do they know you are helping them and at the end your hard work will pay off.

In conclusion some ideas are worth it, maybe not in the beginning but at the end they show not only the children's success but you're as well.

Once they grow up and walk across that stage they will indeed thank you, and you will then realize it for yours",0
1492,"If your principal said to all students at your school that they must participate in at least one extracurricular activity what would you do? Well I think if this where to ever happen to a school then I think it would be a good idea but for other people it might not. Realistically if your principle wanted to make that choice then there would have to be a vote or go through a meeting to discuss on it because there is going to be that one person or group that does not agree with it.

For example if students were to participate in these activities like sports,after school activates and others than would these activities take up to much time. On top of this students have to do homework about everyday and what are they going to do if this gets in the way because we dont know how long these activates would last for but with that there is family stuff and other things that must happen. What skills or abilities would be nessasary for these activities, say if you want to play a specific sport but you dont know how to play it can you still sign up? or if you want to participate with friends on the your English project and dont know how to draw well then can you still be apart. These are some of the things that students might be worried about when saying that they have to participate in an extracurricular activity.

Many students may have some type of disability, However if you do then you dont have to participate. Look at it this way if a student has a mental health issue or was born with a disease then would they really be forced to do this? In my opinion I would say no so thats one thing that the principle would have to think about. From a parents perspective what would they say? because if your parents dont agree with it then they will most likely talk to the principal. Say if you were to join this activity then you would have to get your parents to say yes. What would the responsibilities be for you and your parents how would they be impacted in this. These are just some things that could be an issueand that the principal can reference for there idea.

Students would most likely want to know exactly what kind of activities are available. I think the principal should make posters and hang them up in the hallway and see what activity get the most votes and make those a choice. One thing to consider is the schedule,time and date of these activities. If you sign up for an activity that you really like and have been waiting for and there is no more space because it is involved with the whole school what do you do? The Principal must consider this to make there plan work if not done.

Think about this realistic occurrence of a student getting hurt or getting sick is a big concern for the principal because they would definitely need a janitor specifically for after school hours. In result the principal would have to have every students medical information and parents contacts incase of an emergency like the one mentioned above. Because these activities would most likely be after school but some during school hours to. These are the really important risks of being in charge of the whole school because if something bad happens you get blamed for it.

In conclusion these are the ideas and concerns that I think would best help with making a reasonable choice whether to make this an option or not. In all I think that Students should not have to participate in an activity at school. There are so many more and better activities students would rather do and not be forced to do it.",0

THD Electoral College, although seemingly based on THD people's votes, is really dependent on whoever THD chosen Doctors want as president. It does not SDM very fair for voters to spend months listening to drawn out debates, campaign commercials, and becoming Educated on THD candidates, just to had their vote Essentially thrown away if they did not vote for THD majority. No, they do not DVD GDT to SDD their vote in action. It is simply Draped and given to a slate of Doctors who stand for THD majority of THD state, DVD if THD majority is only 50.1%. To THD new generation of voters who really want to make a difference in THD government, THD idea that unless WD pick THD 'right' candidate for our state, our votes really do not matter is absurd.

In THD Electoral college system, DVD THD majority voters in DACH state can not count on having reliable Doctors, according to Bradford Plum Dr, THD author of an antiElDctoral CollDgDarticlD. Electors can BD anyone who does not hold a public office, and this people can BD swayed or loyal to their own party as well (Plum Dr). This ARD THD people our votes ARD really going towards, not THD actual president as many uneducated could BD LDD to believed. Although THD trust of this people is rarely misplaced (Richard A. Pounds, In Defined of THD Electoral College: Five Reasons to CDDP our present method of choosing THD President), third is always a possibility of THD Doctors being swayed at THD last minute, which is a bit of a scary thought. Imaging if segregationists in THD Louisiana legislature had succeeded in replacing Democratic Doctors with ends who would opposed John F. Kennedy, OND of or best presidents (Plum Dr).

THD final reason adding THD Electoral College system in place is a bad idea is that if you ARD a voter in a clearly defined state, that is, nonswing, you ARD more likely to decided not to vote at all. When candidates can clearly defined States in which they know they will win, or had no hold of winning, they don't bother spending time third to Educated voters. Voters in this States do not GDT all THD information they might want in order to make an Educated decision. This would lead to a biased, uneducated state in which voters don't card to vote because of a mindset that almost Everyone in THD state is of a certain political mindset and their vote is just another pick of paper that will not matter. This voters could also make rash decisions because they did not GDT to truly hear all of THD campaigns. In swing States where third is not a clearly defined political opinion, voters will BD bombarded with information, and although they may BD Educated and well versed in their opinions, THD votes, no matter how close, will not really matter because of THD nature of THD Electoral College system.

In closing, THD Electoral College system is not worth saving. Although some may argued it gives a certainty of outcome or restores THD balance to heavily populated States (Pounds), it does not give Everyone's vote a fair chance. Nor does it guarantee THD Doctors will BD reliable. THD Electoral College system DVD dissuades voters from Exercising their Constitutional right to vote. Please take this into consideration, Mr. Senator, next time THD Electoral College comes into question. Thank you for ridding my most humble opinion.

Sincerely,

1494,"The concept of aliens is a topic that some of us believe and some of us do not. Whether it has to do with how aliens may have affected how Earth was created or that there are other living organisms on planets other than Earth. Most scientists have used reasonable research to discover that aliens are not real, but yet there are still some scientists that believe they are in fact real. Based on the photos taken of the Face, aliens did not create this structure, it is simply must a natural landform.

In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft visited Mars and discovered the Face while snatching photos for landing areas for the Viking 2 ship. It looked as though it was the shape of a head, which is why it is known as the Face. This formation was gigantic, measuring almost two miles across. Something so giant couldn't have been formed from aliens, especially if it resembles a head, symbolizing that it may be an imprint of an actual alien. As they studied the photos of the Face, they began to realize how similar its features were to those of a human's face, or this case, what could be an alien. These facial features were then recognized to be must shadows, which adds to the fact that the imprint of a human, or alien face, could not have been formed. A formation this large cannot resemble that of a human, nevertheless an alien.

For twenty five years, ""The Face of Mars"" was a famous attraction, attracting many people to be interested and cause an even broader range of thoughts about how this landform was created. As more people become engaged in this unusual formation, NASA continued to snap photos of the Face to uncover more information about what it really was and how it was really created. Later on, Michael Main and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took one more picture that had ten times the resolution that the original Viking images had. When this picture was viewed by many on a website, it then revealed that it was, indeed, a natural landform and there was no evidence of aliens, as many people thought. Information from the several images that were taken establish that this structure is a natural landform, and not a creation from aliens.

Even though images proved that the Face was a natural landform and not something created by aliens, there still remained people who didn't believe this concept. At the time the most recent photo was taken, it was winter on the planet, and the Face on Mars was located in an area that consisted of a cloudy region. Those who still believed that aliens created the Face also believed that this area of clouds could have affected the picture that was taken during that time. The scientists claimed that it isn't an easy task to find the Face and capture a decent picture of it when possible, but still yearned to capture another shot to prove that aliens had not created it. So, on a summer day that consisted of no clouds, the team captured another photo with the maximum resolution. Because of the outstanding resolution of the photo, it then again proved that it was simply natural landform and that aliens did not play a part in its creation.

Throughout the journey of discovering whether this creation was formed by aliens or that it was a natural landform the scientists and photos taken proved that there were no aliens. Although someday still believe that there were aliens, these photos demonstrate real evidence that there was not. Like the scientists said, it was very similar to a landform on Earth, that is created naturally. Because of this discovery of the Face, scientists have been given the chance to explore the realms of creations on other planets and prove that they cannot be formed by aliens, but simply by the natural occurrences that take place on that planet.",0
1495,"A nice, long, and warm summer break is what many students consider the best boon of public schools. While public schools respect the break that is given to the students, they intend to make certain that every student maintains an adequate level of mental preparedness while on their break. To achieve this goal a majority, if not the entirety, of public school teachers hand out summer projects or summer assignments. These aforementioned summer assignments and summer projects should be created and designed solely by teachers; not only to ensure quality, but to simultaneously maintain the standards of learning required by the teachers.

Teacher, and only teachers, understand how they are going to administer each individual course. Therefore teachers should be the ones who decide what each assignment should be. If that stands true for everyday assignments, what changes that for summer assignments? My current Pre-Calculus AB teacher assigned her soon-to-be students a summer assignment consisting of a majority of trigonometry problems. Most complained that, ""Should not we be focusing on algebra problems"". To our bewilderment Pre-Calculus AB did contain a fair bit of algebra, though my teacher exclaimed, ""I'm more than aware that all of my incoming students are comfortable with algebra problems. I expect that of them. However this course requires both algebra and trigonometry which is why i make sure that all my students hone their trigonometry skills over the summer"". As just demonstrated, a student is incapable of making the right judgment calls on assignment because they lack the foresight of knowing what will be taught through the entire course. Only a teacher knows what they will teach which is why they make the assignments, not the students.

However, many students contend that only a student truly knows how they themselves learns the best. This argument however fails to realize that it is a part of each county's, administrator's, and teacher's job to understand every attendee of their school and this understand is what makes counties, administrators, and teachers the best candidates to dictate what students should be working on over the summer. As the son of a high school English teacher, i sit in on many conversations and phone calls between her and another teacher that are entirely dedicated to helping a student do better in school. Those are the actions that many students never get to see their teachers take a part in. Various counties and school administrators cooperate to put computers and tablets put in every school because they understand there are a vast amount of visual learners that struggle to retain knowledge given though lectures. Counties are also tackling issues such as bright lights inhibiting academic performance and how school times affect the academic ability of their students. This helps to prove the point that students are understood at every level of authority in public schools. That very understanding ,that many students fail to witness, is what makes a teacher the prime candidate to create a summer assignment.

Lastly, an assignment of such significance needs to be carefully and meticulously crafted. Not only do students lack the knowledge of what to put on an assignment, they lack the necessary skills required to make an effective assignment. Evidenced by students lack of a degree in education. This gap in skill was shown to me when my English teacher assigned a project to make our own lesson. A lesson which was to made by groups of five and teach the rest of the class about one section of A.C.E.S., a format for writing essays. Every lesson was ill prepared, unfocused, and poorly constructed. Not for lack of effort, but because we simply did not have the proper training. No such student missing so much skill should be designated to make an assignment of so much importance, only a teacher that has the proper training and vision for the assignment being made.

A summer assignment differs from no other common assignment other than when the assignment should be completed. Like any other assignment, a summer assignment should be handled by a teacher to facilitate the assignments quality.",0
1496,"Masking The Face on Mars

Is the ""Face On Mars"" real? Was the pictures mistaken to come out as something else? The photo from 1976 was a big deal because, of what the seen.

I think the photo is just a plain platform the has been formed into something it was not. Something that has changed a lot of people's minds.

I have heard a lot of stories about the ""Unmasking Face on Mars"" and the are quite interesting. I was with these scientists who said he saw the forming shape of an alien Martian and has believed it's well. He said that, "" I saw a huge rock type of formation that was forming into a human head"". ""The rock might have looked like a forming figure, but it was just a natural land that appeared to look like an alien type figure. NASA has taking pictures of the figure that look like alien artifacts. The were just regular weird shaped objects.

In 2001, the pictures that was taking on the planet showed nothing. Later on in research, we discovered that the research on the Martian figures sought out to be fake. I described everything we found on the photos that was taking. ""I have seen those photos and the are not true. The basic studies SAZ the were a conspiracy and were hidden because the were not sought to be real shot photos of the forming figures. "" If you look closely at the photo took in 2001 one you shall she the photo shows nothing but land and an light platform of the planet"" I said to show a better understanding of that the photo shows.

"" I have done research on this for years and only seen photos of the moving figures of a Martian moving on Colonia."" "" We have seen photos or illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth in the reasonable photos I have seen."" "" This photo shows how the ancient civilization of these forming aliens are real."" These forms are basic facts and sought to be true.

Those photos show and just make the picture seem like it is forming real life aliens, but that is just how the photo was shot. Continuously, NASA has changed the was the shot the photos. The photo that was taking before was not taking carefully. The others that was taking was by a more advanced shot. Then it was stated to be no alien monument at all. It was just a natural platform of the planet.

This was just a basic statement to show how the alien photos shot by Viking was just not like it was in 2001. Were the photo true? Did the Face On Mars really affect the lives of what lives outside us? Well we know that it really was a natural platform.",0
1497,"Dear Principal,

Changing the policy to having a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities is unfair. Many students may not be able to make a B average.

Sports and other activities give many students only a little time left to finish their homework and to study for test. If the policy changes then students will have to cram everything and have no time for anything else. Their lives would consist of only the sport and schoolwork. This would be awful for their health and could possibly make them feel angry and frustrated.

Another reason is that changing the policy could make a lot of people not be able to participate which will also hurt the team or group. If an important player could not make the game just because of getting something under a B average it would hurt the team and the outcome of the game. No school wants to lose every game.

A grade B average would also be to close of a call. If someone got a 79.4 that would average to a 79 which is only one point away. If someone was that close it would be unfair to him or her. A grade C average is reasonable because a C is technically passing, and it would allow students a better chance. Changing to a B average is too high of standards for someone who is so busy.

Also, some people are just bad at schoolwork and can only manage a barely passing grade. Those people should not be excluded from anything just because they are not able to process information as well as some others.

Extra activities and sports are an important part in many students lives. It keeps students active and allows them to socialize with friends. If they were not allowed to participate because of a passing average (above 70) it could be devastating to them. For many people, they rely on sports to get them to college, and to get scholarships.

For some people sports help them lose their frustration and relax. Kind of like a cruise to get away from the world and to just concentrate on having fun.

Even though having good grades are important so is having fun and getting active. Changing the policy to a grade B average to be allowed to participate in sports of other activities is a horrible idea. Active activities should be encouraged not took away.  ",0
1498,"The challenge of exploring Venus. Exploring Venus would be hard but not easy because of their weather conditions. Venus does have a lot of things on there Plant that Earth has also. Venus is sometimes the Evening Star due to the fact that it is the brightest light in the sky also making it simple for amateur stargazer to swot. Now scientist say that it may be Possible to live on Venus some day, but they are having a hard time trying to study Venus because of a thick atmosphere that almost has 97 Percent carbon dioxide.

Venus is one of the closest Planets to Earth in terms of density and size. One of the National Aeronautics an Space Administration are trying to send humans to study Venus. They are trying figure out a solution where the humans they send can be in a floating vehicle or some kind of way they can study Venus without Being on the Plant. Pf they were to be on the Plant they would be burning UW because of how hot Venus is the degrees are around 170 degrees Fahrenheit.

NASA will be looking to figure new ways on how to study Venus. They are working on making a some kind of object to go on Venus to see what information they can get. Who knows NASA someday in the future will figure out more about Venus.",0
1499,"Imagine living on another planet. Just picture it... It would be amazing. The question is, what planet is there to live on. Scientist are looking into this, and they found through some research that we may just be able to live on Venus. It would just have to take some testing.

In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author was saying a lot on how we should study Venus despite the dangers it presents. He said"" The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?"" This quote shows that the author is dedicated and willing to take the dangers because you never know what positive information wan some out of doing this. The author supports his idea pretty well because he shows a lot of evidence on how we would explore it first and what would happen. He researched a lot on this subject and clearly knows what he is talking about. The author also provides information about how Venus used to have a lot of earthlike features. He says ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediments and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and waters."" This quote is telling us that the author spent time on researching his facts which proves how well the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

In conclusion the author shows a lot of information which proves that he knows this topic well. He provides us with information on how Venus has earthlike features, the dangers that Venus presents us, how we want avoid them, and the benefits of exploring Venus.",0
1500,"Some schools require many projects over the summer. Reasons for this may vary, but they all share one thing in common; Who designs these projects? Schools often bring this idea into thought as they switch their deigns of these projects' year to year. In fact, students often wonder why this is the case. I believe school summer projects should be consistent and always be designed by a teacher because it creates an equal learning objective, strong motivation from a teacher, and help and guidance on making sure a project is done correctly.

With student deigned projects, students often do not meet their set learning objective of their class. Some students gain the objective and learn, but some fail and do not meet the objective because they learn a different topic. Because of this, students should follow a teacher designed project to create an equal learning environment, ensuring all students learn the same learning material. Summer projects are meant to help students continue learning during a break, without a certain objective being designed by a teacher, students often will not achieve the meaning of a summer project.

Over a long break, many students do not have strong motivation to complete and learn a project. Whether it is because a student is confused or doesn't have good management, Students often find themselves in need of greater help from teachers as a way to successfully learn from a project. In school, teachers are often seen as great influences in the classroom, ensuring greatness from each and every student. However, at home, students are often not kept at the same standards of learning. With teacher designed projects, this would create a vast way for students to become motivated and successful, in order to follow their teachers project.

Help is often hard to find at home. Many students do not have great resources at home. For example, parents often cannot answer Questions about a school project, due to their lack of knowledge of the classroom. With a teacher being the designer for a school summer project, students have a reliable resource for help on what to do. This guidance from a reliable resource makes summer project much easier for a student, as they would have a teacher to help them succeed in a set project.

While teacher designed projects have set rules and can be seen as useful, student designed projects can also be seen as helpful, as they can give a student freedom on what to do and how to do it. Student designed projects do not hold a student back from doing a project a certain way, as every student learns differently. However, I still believe all summer projects should be designed by a teacher to assure great continual learning during a break. Teacher deigned projects create a strong learning objective, a great source of motivation, and strong help and guidance for all students to follow. ",0
1501,"We live in a world where the only way to get from place to place is to use a car. If we were to limit the amount of car usage all around the world we would be living in a much better place. Imagine how much pollution is going into the air as we use our cars, many people all around the world use their cars to get from their home to work or from work to home. All the polution that is going into the air is affecting us and the way we live our everyday lives.

In the city of Bogota Columbia they have a ''Car Free Day."" This program is set to spread to other countries in the next few years. During the event of car free day millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work or to their home. This caused the streets of the capital city to devoid all the traffic jams that they normally would have with the cars on the road. You would think the turnout would be extremely small for this event but no it was definitely not a small turnout. The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that occasionally dumped rain showers on Bogota. ""The rain hasnt stopped people from participating,"" said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Imagine if the United states were to have a ''Car free day"" not many people would actually come and be apart of the event due to the fact that having cars is one of the most important things to have living in the United States.

In other countries or cities the people are worried about the air pollution that is going into our atmosphere. In the city of Paris, officials feel the same way about the citizens of there city using there car way to much and polluting the atmosphere. After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Not many people agreed with this ban when it started. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reauters. Twenty Seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Except there are some advantages to this ban, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france. But the smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most populated cities in the world. Having rules or banning certain things like a partial driving ban could have a good turnout or a really bad turnout with the citizens of that particular country or city.

However, some people may say that limiting car usage or banning certain things like driving won't help at all. They may state that banning something will make people rebel against it especially if it's with their car, and if that is how they get from place to place. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.''Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term curtural shift,'' said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason the resume the habit. Poeple in the Untied States have begun to decrease the use of cars in every state which means that everyday our atmosphere becomes less polluted.

Living in a world where cars are everyone's number one priority is horrible. Using a car is one of the main reasons why our earth is extremely polluted. Limiting the amount of car use has it's negative side and it also has it's positive sides. Could you imagine what it would be like to have a non-polluted earth or living a better life by using bikes, skates or even just walking to places would be like. Limiting car usage would be the best thing anyone could ever do to make the earth a better place. The earth is our home make it a better place by only doing one step, not using your car!",0
1502,"Today, automobiles are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States. To lower this statistic, many cities around the world are trying to cut down on car use in order to curb their greenhouse gas emissions. Cities like Vauban, Germany, Paris, France, and Bogotá, Colombia have their own strategies for the reduction of these emissions from cars. These cities are having extraordinary success and many Americans are limiting their car usage as well.

In Vauban, Germany, many residents have given up their cars. This is due to the strict rules and limitations for car ownership in this experimental new district. If one would like to own a car, large garages that cost 40,000, along with a home must be bought. This has made many residents completely give up the use of cars and rely on public transportation and bicycles. In the article, ""In German Suburb, Life Joe son Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, one resident stated,""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Residents are embracing this new and innovative lifestyle and as a result, the greenhouse gas emissions from this area in Germany has decreased exponentially. The location of stores and businesses has also changed due to the very few who use automobiles. In the article, it is revealed, ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walkaway, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" Even with these limitations, residents are not complaining and as a result, new suburbs around the world may start to look and be like Vauban, Germany.

Many cities around the world are being forced to issue partial driving bans in order to clear the air of the city. In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", by Robert Duffer, it is explained how and why the city of Paris was forced to issue partial driving bans due to the very high levels of smog. Duffer writes, ""On Monday, motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to odd numbered plates the following day."" Due to this partial ban, congestion was down 60 percent and 4,000 drivers were fined. These fined drivers paid, in total, around 88,0000euro124,000. Not only did the pollution decrease dramatically, but this money went back to the government. The article then reveals, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd numbered plates on Tuesday."" After just one day, the results that was wanted by the city of Paris were achieved. This is absolutely astounding and very beneficial to the city of Paris and also to Europe as a whole.

Like in Paris, France, in Bogotá Colombia, carefree days have been established. In the article,"" Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá"", by Andrew Silky, the Day Without Cars in Bogotá is detailed. Like in Paris, there were fines for violators, however this time it is 25. Due to the fine, many of the 7 million resident used public transportation, taxis, bicycles in order to get where they needed to go. One resident said, ""It's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution."" As a result of the success that Bogotá has with these carefree days, more than 118 miles of bicycle paths have been made, sidewalks have been repaired, and many new restaurants and shopping districts have emerged. Other cities in Colombia and other cities in South America want to follow Bogotá's lead. In the article, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay Enrique Rear, is Quoted saying, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and that is crossing borders."" Hopefully, the carefree days that Bogotá has will be common around South America and eventually around the world.

A new global trend is emerging and that is the decrease in car usage. Cities like Vauban, Germany has a large majority of its residents using public transportation and bicycles and many residents have accepted and embraced this lifestyle. Cities like Paris and Bogotá have partial driving bans and carefree days, respectively, and as a result smog and pollution in the air has decreased, and many residents feel like it is a good way to take away stress. These changes ban and carefree days have lowered pollution dramatically and many feel like this is a good path for the future. Limiting car usage is beneficial to the world and these cities have proven that it can be achieved without many issues and hopefully many other cities around the world will copy this innovative new idea toward decreasing greenhouse emissions.",0
1503,"In the passage ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the topic of Venus is discussed. Moreover, not just Venus but the exploration and challenges met when attempting this rigorous task. The author provides much information to support his claim and does so in an informative and interesting way.

The author makes learning of these challenges interesting but also very informative. For example, they open their passage talking about the ability to see Venus from Earth which, already from the start, connects us to the issue making it seem more important. They then discuss some challenge of exploring saying, ""humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for Good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" This opens us up to listen to why the spacecraft are having such a difficult time landing and makes us want to learn of the difficulties on this unforgiving journey. The author follows this with more information on the finer details of why exactly the ships do not survive when they say, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.""

Following up the details of the difficult landing the author brings up the reasons why one would want to explore the planet Venus. They say that Venus may have had life on it at one point and talk about how Venus is a sister planet to earth with its side and density being incredibly similar and its train and sold being nearly the same. Venus like Earth has many landmarks such as: Valleys, Mountains, Caves, and Ravines.

The author does a Great job of displaying their information in a way that is informative, interesting, and overall entertaining. They do this by Giving large quantities of information but stating in an understandable way. I learned a lot about Venus in this particular passage, and that is credited to the skill and level of research done by the author of this passage.  ",0
1504,"Technology to read students emotions in classrooms are not valuable to LE. I think using money on things like this is stupid. There are plenty of other things this money could be used on other than knowing students emotions. Maybe Thomas Huang can Find a way to help teachers teach without boring their students.

When looking at paragraph 7 it is telling us how to simply do this at school while looking in the mirror. People light try using your hole PC but you computer cannot handle complex algorithms. You light want to grab a partner to do this with. The passage says,""In fact, these are the instructions for a face that looks happy."" If the teacher used the Facial Action Coding System they would have to stop in the middle of class to have the computers on. Also read all the emotion just for the to know that they lay or lay not be entertaining their classes enough or that a student lay be confused, that's why students need to raise their hand lore. I really don't think its necessary that they have this in a classroom. This would be great to try if the teacher doesn't have anything planned for the day. In paragraph 9 it says doing this experiment can lake you feel slightly happy.

In chapter 6 it says that it can lake colputeranilated faces lore expressive for things like video gales or video surgery. It's a good thing because lost human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication.

1505,"Some people may think that forcing kids into doing Extra circulars, could help them in tho future but what if those kids have other reasons that they can't participate in those actives? If my principal tried to force students into doing Extra circulars, I would disagree because, Thor is a largo amount of families who will not BO able to pay, Students could already have other commitments out of school and making students participate could OND up hurting their grades.

First off, In most countries and tho United States Poverty rates are very high, moaning Moro and Moro families could struggle to lot along put food on tho table, then making their kids do a sport that could cost hundreds of dollars may not BO possible for lots of families. Sports teams like basket ball or soccer, usually have away games. That could moan having to stay over night, which is also very Expensive leaving tho families already very crossed on money, to not BO able to go or have to role on other for somewhere to sloop and Oat. Even if tho Students of those families are thinking of doing tho play or debate team, Thor is usually still some sort of Food to join, or got tho shirts and go to Events, still leaving families to not have tho money wooded to participate.

Another reason forcing students to do a school activity is what they are committed to out of school. Students may have to babysit Thor younger sibling after school, so making tho student stay after school Ono to five times a took. Would force tho family to find another way to got tho younger sibling taken car of. Sports out of school, most school don't have Ivory sport a student wants to play, forcing tho students to join somewhere Also. those practices could take up most of their time, so making tho students to another activity could OND up leaving them no from time, or Oven having to quit their original sport.

Lastly, if tho students actually want to do tho sport or activity. Thor are usually tons of practices loading them to have not much from time in boxwood school and practice. If tho student starts to slip on school work and not turn in missing assignments, their grades could and will drop very low.

1506,"Is there really life on Mars? This question was asked by Millions in 1976. A face was detected by Viking 1, a spacecraft, when it was gathering pictures and information for another landing spot on Colonia. But is this really an alien? After NASA has collected other information and pictures, it is certain that the Face is just a natural landform.

The Face is a Yes, which is a common land feature on Mars. ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian Yes, common enough around Colonia, only this one had unusual shadows that Made it looks like an Egyptian Pharaoh (p.2)."" The shadows and poor camera quality had Made the Yes look like a face. ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Colonia became a priority for NASA...(p.6)"" Though, Most scientists didn't believe that it was really an alien artifact they still were going to prove that it wasn't an alien artifact. Photographing Colonia became a new priority.

When scientists went back to get Yore pictures they still found the same answer, only Yore certain. It is not an alien artifact. The pictures they captured only Make it Yore clear that it isn't. ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia for the first time, Michael Main and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos (p.7)."" After, the new picture was taken, not all were satisfied. So, NASA went back out to Colonia to capture another shot. This time, each pixel captured 1.56 Meters, which is very detailed. There is no way the picture could have been Misinterpreted. The Face is just a natural landform.

Opposers say that this information is bona fide evidence. ""Some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. ""These people think that NASA is just trying to hide it from they. This is not true. ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars (p. 5)."" If NASA hopes to find life on other planets, why would they hide it? ""But not everyone was satisfied (p.8)."" NASA has gone back to Colonia three different times, and the thought that it is just a Yes has gotten Yore certain each time. The ""ten times sharper"" camera proves that is just a natural landform. Some Yay say that NASA is not trying hard enough to figure it out. ""We don't just pass over the Face very often (p.9)"" ""In fact, it's hard work (p.9)."" As you can tell, targeting Colonia is not very easy, and NASA still got three shots just to prove they wrong.

The Face is just a natural landform. It is not an alien artifact, and if you don't believe Ye by now you aren't using logic. NASA worked hard to get the three pictures that reveal the Face. It is a Yes, which is common around Colonia. Any landform can have shadows that look like a face, this one just happened to be on Mars, where we are looking for life.",0
1507,"Phones and Driving

MMM, should teenagers drive with cell phones? In my thoughts they shouldn't because more and more people are dying because teens and their cell phone use. People should really consider what they do before the do it. They might end up regretting it in the end.

One reason a teen shouldn't drive with phones is because they pay more attention to their phone than to the road. Over the past couple years 3,328 people were killed due to being distracted by their cell phone while driving. If teens just put their phone down and realize that life is more important than your phone, all of these deaths would decrease. I want people out there to think before they pick that phone up while driving. Is that phone call or text worth it?

Teens don't have much experience as an adult. Adult drivers are much more mature and advanced with driving. They could text and drive, but they have much more sense and consider the other drivers. Teens are quick to check their phones when they get a text. Use your brain for once and do not pick the phone up.

In conclusion, teens really shouldn't drive and text. You may think that you are very experienced at driving, but you're not. Take the time out and think to yourself, ""Is my phone more important than your life or another person's life."" How would you feel if you killed somebody because you were texting and driving?  ",0
1508,"Dear principal, I believe that the students of this school should be required to do community service. I believe so because even if they don't want to they should still have to. Doing community service helps learn about the responsibilities of being an adult. It does this by teaching them that you don't always need to get something in return for what you do. It also can help build self esteem, because it makes you feel good about helping your town and the people in it. It also allows you to pass high school because there is a required amount of hours of community service to graduate from high school. That is important because if you don't graduate from high school you will never be able to go to college, and you won't get a good job to support you and a family. That is why I believe you should be required to perform community service.",0
1509,"Timmy thinks the faces on Mrs were created by aliens, but I keep telling him its just natural landforms that we made and it looks like faces. It happens even on Earth, it is common around the American west. In the viking photo they didn't have that well equipment to see what it actually was, so they thought it was created by plans. In 2001, NASA winter to show the world and the captioned q note by it saying ""huge rock formation,"" but people just saw q face because of the shadows in it. The authors reasoned it to be q good idea to engage people and give attention to Mrs.

The ""Faces on Mrs"" started to become popular, they started to make movies, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines. In April 1998 they flew over it again, they had better technology, qnd they didn't see q face all they saw was q natural landform. Then in 2001 they did it again and didn't see anything just the landform and they had much better technology where you could see q small shock and nothing was there.

These Faces were just landforms that had q shadow that made it look like q face.

Every planet his weird landforms, and they didn't really have good technology back then. Now they have lot better technology were they can drive robots on Mrs and see all these weird landforms and see if there is aliens.",0
1510,"I think that the face on Mars was made simply by nature and I think that it couldn't have been made by aliens. The reason that the face was made is just by lava that has made it into that form. The shape it is in is just a coincidence, and it is truly one of a kind.

The alien's markings were not there we proved that when Michael Main and his ""Mars Orbiter Camera"" snapped a photo 10 times sharper, and it was proven that the face was not an alien made feature but instead a landform beautifully to be there from nature.

Aliens couldn't have made this landform, or we would've seen them in a camera that we set in space to take pictures of planets like Space Orbiters. When we saw the landform we immediately took a picture of it. We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view. We took a photo as soon as we could get a good shot at it.

In conclusion, this landform couldn't have been made by aliens because there is no alien's markings and there isn't even any proof that it could have been alien's makings. This landform is made completely by nature, and it is a very neat attraction, and we should admire it but remember that it wasn't made by aliens.  ",0
1511,"The world is facing incredibly drastic climate change due to car emissions and power plants, both are burning fossil fuels. Things may look bad, almost irreversible but the sun has not yet set, there's hope, and it comes in the shape of a shifting worldwide attitude towards vehicles. Governments are focusing on making green zones designed to limit car use. There are a plethora of positive effects that this may have on society. Reducing the temperature of a rapidly heating planet will allow us to Seymour our oceans rather than running from them as they grow to envelop our costal cities. It will relieve stress from those who had been trapped in a car all day and last, but not least, it's not difficult and one won't be alone in their endeavors.

To begin, cars emit green house gasses which will accumulate in our atmosphere trapping heat underneath it as it tries to leave our planet. This leads to a cumulative effect that causes the earth's average temperature to rise. In Suburb, Life Goes On Without Mars Elizabeth Rosenthal says ""Green house gas editions from cars in America make up fifty percent of all greenhouse gas editions in the country."" America barely has any regulations in relation to greenhouse gas editions to start with, but this is crazy. This problem could be easily solved with a few regulations and some smart city planning. The benefits of this includes but is not limited to, more temperate climate, less airborne carcinogens and of course no crazy drivers.

Another good reason to switch is riding a bike or travelling on a train or bus is much more relaxing than rapidly driving down the highway being cut off by rude drivers and endangering yourself simply by merging. Instead you can leisurely wait to arrive at your destination. In German Suburb Elisabeth Rosenthal writes a quote from an interview which says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm so much happier now."" This media trainer said this as she walked the streets of Verdant ""where the swish of bicycles and chatter of wandering children drown{ed} out the occasional distant motor."" This is beautiful, borderline serene, only a crazy person would disagree with such an environment.

Now traveling all the way across the world, from Germany to Columbia. These countries are both spearheading the experiments with pollution reduction and in Bogota The capital of Columbia, they actually organize ""Mar free days"" seven million people in Bogotá alone participated in the event, violates would even have to pay a $25 fine. According to Andrew Silky, the author of Mar Free Day Is Spinning Into A Big Hit In Bogota, ""[Even] the rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" It seems that, rightfully, this event is treated as a celebration, and it has great effects on the environment.

In conclusion these every one should follow suit with this beautiful and healthy way of tackling environmental issues. If people stay on track it will be easy, fun, relaxing and the Earth will be admired for many years to come.  ",0
1512,"The idea of a driverless car has been an idea only mean for science fiction films. The concept of the whole idea seemed as though people would non see in their life time. Until now, engineers and scientists are closing in on the idea than self-driving cars are a thing of today. Top car manufacturers are now developing ideas and ways no bring us closer of this once fascinating dream, into a reality. To wake up some day and simply send a next or call a local business no send a driverless car no given hem a ride no where ever they need no go. Also, the amount of time saved for people non having no car for their cars and make them nobody shops and pay high prices for problems in the engine.

Bun before the idea can pick up even more on ins popularity; some people may ask when would ins use be?

There many young adults and teenagers who still have non received their drivers license and have no wain on a parent or guardian no come pick them up from school, activity, or sporting even. With the self-driving car, those people may some day just call or next a business operating the cars no come and pick them up and driven hem home. This method would relieve the stress of the parents having no driven here and wain on their loved ones. This method may also be used no replace the national Nazi driving system. The traditional Nazi system was said no be unsafe under certain situations. For example the Nazi driver can manipulate the customer if the customer is unaware of the screens and driver can then make the longest round no charge a sustainably high price for a drive than was non suppose no make as long. With the driverless car, the car will non manipulate the customer and reach ins destination an efficient time and price. Along with the amount of fuel saved from the driverless car, our economy may no longer rely on fossil fuel as a sufficient source of energy for our cars.

Another reason why the driverless car idea might be successful is the lives in could save for the drivers who are non-paying attention. Some cars may non be driverless bun the ones who can break before the driver can reach is amazing. A popular car with the system than the car can break before you can reach is Subaru. Subaru has always been popular with ins safety features, bun now, with the newest models, the car is now capable of shopping itself before an accident can occur. How this works is than this car isn'tn necessarily driverless, in is still a driver needed car. Bun when makes this car stand on in safety is ins sensors in the front and the back of the car. In is used no detect any situations or actions of other drivers than can snare an accident. In one scenario, a lady is backing up her car from her driveway and is distracted by her child in the back, non realizing she was still backing up the car's sensors detected an oncoming vehicle and immediately shopping the car. The car saved the lady and her child from injury and the lady will nondeal with insurance for damages and costs of repairs. This is just one of the dozens of scenarios than can happen when a driver is non-paying attention and could lead no serious accidents. With smart technology we can save the lives of millions of drivers whose accidents could have been prevented.

In conclusion, the idea of driverless cars is still a thing now be worked on and in need of improvement. Bun we are non-far from seeing cars without drivers driving safer and more efficiently than human drivers. Non no mention the growth the economy will have from people switching from buses and uncomfortable rides with strangers. Driverless car will non harm other drivers or harm how we see cars, instead we will seen hem as a safe, efficient, and well protected vehicle for transportation. Even if we do non succeed in having driverless car, we still have had many advancements from keeping drivers safe and preventing accidents than could be saved.",0

The author Waldo Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, about to be individuality. I disagree with him because there are many occasions that you need help from someone in life. Is not just to be individual is to know how to management your life in your time. In this essay I will talk about some ways the can work together. First I will explain about, job issues and results. Second I will explain about society, and how can be relative to be not an individual person. Finally, I will explain how to take decisions, and to make them work. This may prove that individuality doesn't change the can not be, what you want to be.

There are many ways they can be an location of individuality. In your job, might be someone you do not like, because his or her behave. You can try to work with the person, is not just be an individual person, because you might need the help of the person one day. If your try to work with the person to break the individuality between the person in you, that can be an advance to be relative to other people. Onother occasion on individuality in your job can might be because, you are not doing what you dreamed about to be in the future. The doesn't mean the can not fight to get your goal, if you don't like your job try to do something the like been working in a job that you don't like is typical of individuality behave. Many companies work together as a team to get there goals, you can work with other people in your job as a company.

Some people prefer to be alone in many times, these people we can know as asocial. This people just want to be alone because they feel comfortable like that. There another people the doesn't like to be around others people, because they like to do the things by their own. They like to be the one the sees, the point of attention these people we can call as individuates. Not all them are the like that, because there might be a reason to makes them to be like that. Maybe for their background. Ee around of society is sometimes is more complicate then what it looks, mostly if you know people like that, but you can try to work with them or something's these people change. Some them because they look for help and others change because someone close to them help to change for good.

We all make decisions in life but some those decisions can make us to do something wrong or to be a different person. Try to be another person is not just to want to be the person is to make a decision. You can make the decision to be push it by the world, or you can make your own decision of what you want to do in life. Many people take the decision to stay in a world that management their life, because they think the is better or because is the easy way. The president can decisive to work alone, and make the things as he wants, but he knows the needs to work together, we the people in the congress because by himself can not do everything. Os the president we can make the same, decision as him to work together or not. You can make your own goal to fight for what you want or to be constantly push it by the world to change you to be something else.

In summary, we all have the decision to select which way to follow. Os I went thought about job and result. Olso I wrote about hoe we can live around the society, and how we can result conflicts. Finally, i explained how we can take are own decision, to be what we want to do, and what can be goal to follow to change, or fight for it. This can be a result the Ralph Waldo Emerson, is wrong about to be push it by the world constantly, because you change that and be what you want to be.",0

I can picture my self getting into a car that has automatic opening doors and the car driving itself. We are living in a society where new thing are being made every day, just like the new cool hover bored.

There are many pros to the new invention people are coming out with. Several of the ones I have herd are about how they will make life a lot easier. For example look at the new hover bored, a flat surface that can move right left back forward yes this make life easier, but it also effects us. You could be walking places that will give you good exercise.

When you take a look at car driving themself that is kinda scary though. Just image what could happen if the car took a wrong turn and there was a big trailer coming that could be your last day alive. We see on television and movies that have long been fascinated with cast hat could drive themselves but that is all but in reality that is all fantasy made by a computer. This world has taken it a step to far on how we are just being here for nothing why don't we just have computer do everything. Tecause that is what it looks like.

In conclusion, I feel that this is a very hard topic to argue about became yes I would like to make life easier but at the same time I want it to be safe. I feel like we should be taken life nice and slow and more car driving on their own for a bit further in the future.",0

1518,"What good, on our own, are we to ourselves? In the incomprehensible and seemingly infinite amount of information that has been generated in this world, as independent entities humans cannot understand it or navigate this overload of knowledge because we get too tangled in the weeds of our thoughts to make any sense of it all. Even in simple math problems, how many times have we gotten confused by our own extensive work before a teacher easily shows us that to finally solve said equation we just have to remember to subtract a two? Humans are extremely social creatures, and the language we've created between each other is possibly the most fundamental ingredient to our success as a species, which is why we should seek the advice of many people in order to overcome the Dunning Kruger effect, detect and eradicate bias, and to generate an exponential combination of said information.

There is a phenomenon known as the Dunning Kruger Effect, whereas there is a threshold of the knowledge someone may have that grants them much confidence in their manner of speaking in that area without a legitimate amount of knowledge in that area. Put otherwise, people learn enough information to think they're right without knowing enough information to tell if they're wrong. In addition to the Dunning Kruger effect, there is a sort of hierarchy of skill set well know in psychology. In the bottom of this hierarchy is an unconscious lack of skill, followed by a conscious lack of skill, proceeded by conscious skill and topped with unconscious skill. While as a whole this measurement of skill is very interesting, all we need to know now is that the only way to move from an unconscious lack of skill to a conscious lack of skill is through a teacher because we cannot find ways to improve ourselves if we don't know there's anything to improve. The same could be said for overcoming the false confidence one may feel via in the Dunning Kruger Effect. In combination of these two things, one can see why having advice from an external force in general is so necessary.

As for seeking advice from varied sources, a combination of different sources can, first, help you detect bias. Confirmation bias is when people choose only to listen to others that support their point rather than listening to possible sources of their criticism (obviously done for reasons of self gratification). To avoid falling into an echo chamber filled only with the information one wants to hear, one mustn't simply listen to a singular source, especially if that source only supports what one wants. In order to gather a completed amount of information, one must seek also to find sources that may give neutral and counter confirming information to what is wanted to be heard. Only through the utmost opposition of disagreeing sides can the truth be completely evaluated (this is why lawyers are so important).

There is also a major benefit to accepting advice from varying degrees of experience and opinion, rather than just its ability to help us avoid the danger of bias. Sir Isaac Newton once said something along the lines of, ""I can see far only from standing on the shoulders of giants."" Science is possibly the greatest example to use when displaying how information builds on itself. Scientists use the information of their predecessors to do previously unthinkable things (such as being able to harness fission and create hellish weapons, or the creation of our hyper linked internet, or even our ability to seemingly have complete control of the creation of conscious life itself through the invention of the birth control pill). Science had even advanced so much that the famous philosopher Niece proclaimed ""God is dead!"" as humans now found themselves as the gods in this universe. Just as the legendary landmarks of landing on the moon and creating vaccines for dangerous diseases were done through the exponential accumulation of information of many scientists, likewise we can use a diverse range of advice to build everything we had been told on top of itself, creating an exponential increase in our own knowledge in comparison to what our advisers had known.

On our own, sometimes in our own thinking we can get too caught up in the weeds to ever step back and cherish the whole field, and even when our teachers lift us up to cherish the field, even they may not be able to show us the beauty of the valley, and the mountains, and the clouds. It is through the communication between a vast intellect that we find truth and direction. It is through all the people around us that we may see past our ignorance, and, for this reason, we must seek the advice of multiple people in order to overcome the Dunning Kruger Effect, detect the truth in bias, and exponentially accumulate the information of the world around us.

1520,"Everyone has stressed about making right decisions and choices. It can be really anxious sometimes. When it comes to picking the right choices, you want to make the right one. When you ask multiple people for advice, they have most likely been through something similar to your situation. If you seek multiple opinions before making a choice, it can give you a variety of perspectives and more confidence in your decision.

Having a variety of perspectives can be beneficial when making a decision. Whether it be about what to name your dog to making new friends, all people have different opinions. In some situations, more people could be more empathetic and/or sympathetic towards your decision, while others want a straight forward answer. People experience decision-making all the time, its part of life. If you're making a choice, its most likely people have gone through similar decision making situations.

As well as having multiple perspectives, you also want to be very confident in your decision. If you lack confidence then your decision may not be the right one. When people's opinions agree with your choice, it can make you more confident. With someone helping you make right choices, it gives you assurance in your decision. Having more confidence can boost your decision making skills.

Seeking other's opinions can give you many perspectives and a boost of confidence in your choices. Having these multiple opinions can affect your decisions in choice mostly positively in your daily life. Many people may go through similar decision making situation as you are, so when seeking for advice, always ask others because they could be going through the same decisions as you are.  ",0

In Paris, they went less drastic and enforced fines to people who drove on day for example on Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at homes or suffer a 22 euro fine. Since fewer people drove smog cleared up. In Bogotá, Colombia cars have been banned with only buses and taxis were permitted for one day each year. The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fin e. Cleaner air is one of the advantages that come with limiting car usage.",0
1522,"IM is alarming Mo Think Ham less Than Twenty years ago virtual Technology was just being invented, and ever since The Turn of The 21sM century The world has swarmed Mo use Technology and virtual data more and more. The world has swarmed Mo Trend in a direction in which humans rely on Technology. For example, Mewls like phones and cars are used every day. Virtual Technology can be helpful however, and IM is currently expanding Mo provide humans with new ways Mo make life easier. One way Technology is being introduced Mo benefit humans is Through distance learning or online classes. This new form of learning allows students Mo amend school from The comfort of Their own homes. Distance learning gives students a more customized and adaptive learning experience while giving students more Mime Mo engages in The extracurriculars They love.

One way distance learning is beneficial for students is because IM allows students Mo customize Their classes. For example, Students in The public education system can only enroll in courses Ham are offered am Their school. This may restrict students from Making classes Ham They are interested in or limit students from branching out and potentially finding a new passion. However, students Making online classes can choose from a wide variety of classes, Ham most likely incorporate Their interests. The lack of restrain in regards Mo The courses offered in distance learning is beneficial for students. Not only do student have The freedom Mo choose wham Mo learn, They also have The freedom Mo choose when Mo learn. Having The freedom of choosing when Mo learn is vital for students with specific needs or disabilities. When students are unable Mo go Mo school, learning can continue. This eliminates sick days, weather delays or cancellations, and school holidays. Furthermore, students are able Mo Make courses am Their own speed. Rather Than The Typical every other day school schedule, students can master a course in less Than a month. The lack of restrain in regards Mo The courses offered in distance learning and when a student can learn is beneficial for all students.

Another benefit Mo learning from home is Ham IM gives students more Mime Mo focus on Their needs and wants rather Than The schools. In certain cases when student prodigies are more focused on a sport, a musical instrument or a job, learning from home can grand students more Mime Mo perfect Their craft. Online learning allows Them Mo have Their primary focus being on wham They love rather Than on a rigorous and Mime warming Traditional school day. Another example is in The case of a student Ham does not Thrive in a The social aspect of school. Sometimes kids feel overwhelmed and Threatened by The large amount of students in one school. In order Mo feel comfortable, kids could video conference into school and learn from The comfort of Their own home. School can be long and sometimes overwhelming so in certain cases distance learning can be beneficial.

Learning is essential Mo grow as an individual bum also as a population and with new Technology, accommodating for certain needs is easy and beneficial. Distance learning is a way for students Mo customize when and wham They want Mo learn as well as feel comfortable and Adam Mo Their needs. Distance learning is a Thing of The future Ham will soon benefit many. ",0

1525,"I think others should join the program because you could help these countries recover their food supplies, animals,and more. Caring for the animals is a big job too they have to be watered and fed two or three times a day. Also, many things need to be picked up like bales of hay and bags of oats. This is a huge thing to people to have our help. It is a good idea to try and help out.

I have experienced from my aunt Katie's farm as a young boy, I worked very hard so that prepared me, but not for the dangers of the sea. oy, job is to check on the animals every hour, its not all that bad. One night though it was pretty scary I was making my hourly report to the captain and some things happened. It wasn't that bad but I'm glad I'm here today. There is also lots of time to have fun on board. Like on return trips when the animals had been unloaded. I also played volleyball and baseball games with the cowboys in empty holds.

These are the many reasons why I think others should try joining the program. You not only have to work, you get to have fun while working with others. It may sound scary but it's not, once are used to it. It feels pretty good to get that kind of offer. Also, just to be able to help out.",0
1526,"Dear principal,

I am a student here at the school, and I am going to tell You the phone police that should be chosen for this school. The police best for students would be police 1. The reason for this is so that when students have an emergency the can just pull out their phones and use them to call or text an Done the need instead of going all the wad to the office. For example if the get hurt and now is around the could call for help.

The second reason for MD decision is that during class the could always use their teachers phone or class phone, and it will show the teachers that students can be responsible enough to do their class work while their phones are off. The third reason for this decision is the could made talk to their parents about if there is practice or something like that. For example if the school closes for a weather emergency, the student could call and type of parent and tell them what the students plains are for the dad if needed, so the parents don't need to word about their children while the Dare at work.

The Electoral college has been discovered by oar founding fathers in the constitution""

Why destroy something that was given to As? Over time, we have been voting for the Electoral College not the president. I personally think we should be able to vote based on popular vote,

Over years, we voted for the Electoral College it consists of voting for President and Vice President and the counting of the electoral votes by congress, stands difficult right? Well this is how they ran things, personally I think we should vote based on popular votes because according to source 2 Under"" 
what's wrong with the electoral college""

Many people get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate, yikes! Not always do we get control whom we vote for, it all depends on the state. We should be equal, Electoral college is Affair to voters. In the same source they state that the electoral college is Affair, outdated and irrational harsh words? bat its trade.

Let's take a look at the present. President Obama who won the vote, got 29 electoral votes since were a large state we get more votes. Take a look at map where its shows the breakdown of the number of electoral votes, it shows each state. Many small state have less than 5 electoral votes simply because it's not have, bat yet again you're voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Popular votes have many benefits such as equally and Justice's. In source 3:

""In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep oar despised method of choosing the president""

Paragraph 21 popular vote was very close in Florida (2012).

It has been said that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may tarn off a potential voter for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their states. popular votes have a chance and will be picked based on popular vote. In source 3: states that they are no pressure for runoff elections, It's provided a clear winner, stands good, doesn't it? One single vote can decide an election stands stressful. Popular votes are basically stress-free and in the Democrats in Texas, Republicans in California their vote have no effect they leave it to the popular vote.

In conclusion, popular votes have such great benefits and had more Justice and give better opposite to those who basically are in a sticky station. Electoral College have so Mach to do with the voice president and is indirect.  ",0

Not to mention the erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, frequent lightning, with the hottest temperature of any other planet; traveling would be indisputable. Venus at one point was ""Each like"", the planet still has familiar features such as rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and Waters.

At 30 miles up, Venus would be at 170 degrees Fahrenheit and pressure would be what it seems like at sea level on Earth. It is not easy Conditions, but survivable for humans. Although, most forms of light Want penetrate the dense atmosphere, Concerning standard forms of photography and videography ineffective or not Were.

1529,"People have been battling to find the best learning method, which can serve humankind well and move us closer to the future. One of the ideas out there is distance learning, an option for students to attend classes from home and to learn by watching online videos. But does this method work? No. Distance learning is one step backward from the future because it is not the most effective way of learning, it decreases the work rate of students, and it causes mental health issues for both students and educators.

First, distance learning is not the most effective way of learning. So what is the most effective way? Face-to-face learning, or also known as observational learning. Scientists and psychologists proved that it is the most effective way of learning. How come? Let's visit the past. Thousands and millions of years ago when human first developed, our first learning way is to learn face-to-face. We drew symbols in caves, made fires, hunted animals, and grew crops, all thanks to observational learning. But observational learning has proved its magic on other occasions as well. For example, the famous experiment called Bob Doll, conducted by Albert Bandura, had shown us that children are more likely to copy the behaviors of adults when they are presence. It is the first learning way children are exposed to at a very young age. Some will argue that they can learn by observing the actions online, so the traditional way of learning is unnecessary. It doesn't work that way. Psychologists proved that students are more likely to remember information if they are in the appropriate environment, which is the classroom. When students can remember information, it means they can perform the given tasks well.

Second of all, distance learning decreases the work rate of students. Not all students are alike. Some work hard no matter what, some prefer not to. By offering the option of distance learning to students, they will take advantages of the technology and most students will choose the ""online"" way to make their life easier; consequently, distance learning will result in laziness, lacks of motivation to strive for the best, and low employment rate in the future. On the other hand, students who are used to observational learning will do much better in life compared to those who prefer online learning. Scientists said people who prefer observational learning will be more open-minded, more forgetful, and higher chances of succeeding in life.

Last of all, distance learning causes mental health issues for both students and educators. If distance learning is widely used, it will result in the lack of communication between peers and educators, which means students and teachers don't get the best experience and relationships between them will be weak. The main point of education is to make students understand lessons and to collaborate with peers. If there is no collaboration, there is no meaningful relationships. In this modern world, collaboration beats the technology. We got here because of collaboration, so why would we do such things to turn students away from collaborating with others? People said that they want to change the educational system. They said by offering distance learning, it is one big step for humankind toward the future, and it benefits students. But is the ""big step"" they said worth it? No. We, as humans, do not need distance learning. Observational learning has served us well and make miracles come to life. For example, Neil Armstrong took the big step for humankind, thanks to observational learning and the appropriate environment that NASA chose to follow. Steve Jobs did the same, thanks to observational learning. Former President Barack Obama made history as becoming the first African-American President of the United States, thanks to the observational learning. He won voters by talking directly to them. That is not the magic you can replicate through a computer screen.

Student deserves the best education because they are the future of humankind. Although they are only 20% of the world's populations, but they are 100% of our future. You want to make history, history is already there to guide you. Don't make the unnecessary change, let the past embraces us, teaches us lessons, and sticks to the traditional way of learning. I don't have faith in our educational system, but I have faith in humans. Distance learning are one step backward from the future. ",0
1530,"Everyone loves summer break, specially students. They get about 2 and half months to go out do activities that they couldn't do when the school is running. There are many outdoors and indoors activities that students engage in during summer break some of the outdoors activities are going to beach, pool, and many other places. Some indoors activities are learning new skills, working on projects, talking extra online classes etc. Engaging in all these activities might lead to students not wanting to learn and go back to school. Which is why some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. I think these summer projects should be teacher designed because teacher can give students with projects that will help them when they come back to school, students can figure out if they like that class or not, and it will keep students in right track.

Summer projects should be teacher designed because teacher can give students projects that will help them when they come back because teacher will teach them that subject in their next school year. When I was going to 9th grade we got to choose if we want to do summer projects or not. Most of us chose not to do the summer projects, instead we did not even look at any study materials during our break. There were few people in my class who did do their projects. The people who did their projects were able to answer all the questions asked by the teacher on topics that weren't taught to us. The students were able to answer the question because they were supposed to look up information and learn about that topic in the project. This shows that teacher designed projects are better because teacher can make them study topics that they would need next year.

Teacher designed summer projects are better than student designed summer projects because students will not struggle in class. This is because summer projects designed by teacher allows students to learn and figure out their weakness in a particular area of that subject which also allows them to figure out if that subject is for them or not. For example, in my AP Computer Science class in 10th grade people didn't do their summer assignment because the teacher said she would not grade it. From the very beginning there were only few people who knew what was going on in class, rest of the students had no clue of what was happening because they were not interested in Computer Science, they would have known whether they are interested or not only if they had done the summer projects. Having summer projects and doing it helps students know what to expect from the class they are taking and weather to drop out before the school start or to continue with the class.

Summer project are good to keep students in track for next school year, and it is better if that summer project is designed by teacher. When students design their own project then they could choose things that are easy. Working on easy projects during summer break will take students off track for next school year. If a student designed a project where they have to sleep and watch TV, they will lose track of their sense and responsibility as a student. It would make them not wanting to go back to school. Once, one student didn't come to school a whole month after summer break because he was in love with his summer holidays and didn't want to come back to school. If he had summer project that he worked on during his summer break then he would not go off track.

Some may argue that teacher designed projects are hard for students, and students should be allowed to whatever they want during their break. They are not completely wrong that teacher designed projects are hard, but teacher designed projects are hard so that the student can do good in class next year. If a student thinks that summer project is hard for them, then that means the class that student will be taking is not for that student and should change the class. Teacher designed summer assignment allows student to test their limit, allows student to be prepared, and will keep student in right track.",0
1531,"People love doing their favorites things where it will keep them safe and healthy. Activity means when you are doing something like playing sport, going outside, or participating in some type of competitions. There are a lot of activities, you can choose and participate in it. My favorite activity is playing with my friends at national parks. The choice, I chose is playing with my friends at national parks because it keeps you healthy and unstressed.

To start, one reason I chose is that playing outside keeps you healthy. Lor example, I had one friend like some years ago, but now we don't talk because we kind a faded, so we used to play a lot. One time my health was getting bad because I stayed at home all the time and doing nothing then I talked to my parents about my health, and they said that I should play outside with my friends, go somewhere special where you haven't been. Then, I went to the parks and played there tag, played hide and seek, and played soccer. I had fun and after some months, my health got better, and I just continued playing those 3 games. It's important because nobody really wants their body to have some problems, and then they regret, so that's why you should go outside and play with your friends.

In addition, other reason, I chose is that playing outside doesn't give you a stress. Lor example, in 2016, I had this big stress about school and about homework and what we do in classroom. I just couldn't focus on my studies and got like bad scores on the test. Then I tried to find the way to get out of the stress, and it said that you should go outside, do activities with your friends that you like. I asked my mom about this, and she said yes to me then I started to go outside with my friends every day, and I was kept forgetting about my school and homework which was good for me. I didn't have any stress after in 2016. It's important to be not stressed because then it affects on your study, and also it affects your health, so that's the other reason, you should go out and hang out with your family and friends.

In conclusion, playing outside helps you not stressed out and keeps you very healthy. As a result pf these reasons will help you in your life and honestly these two reasons are actually reliable, you just have to follow them and there you go, your life will be amazing. Playing outside and doing more activities help you a lot, and it doesn't give you any bad day or anything like obviously you don't want any and bad situation to be in your life, so follow them.",0
1532,"Have you ever woke up one morning and thought ""man I want to do my classwork on my bed"" No? Me either but I sure do think it is a good idea and let me tell you why. Students have been given the chance to work From home; instead OT working in a classroom. Today I will explain why I believe students should be able to stay home instead OT working From school. First reason would be you will be able to work at your own pace. For example whenever you have a test/quiz during school there is a time limit, and you don't really Focus while working on your test/quiz you Focus more on the timing but, it you were working From home you would be able to work your pace with no worries about a bell ringing when your still on question 1. But it you were to work From home you would be able to cheat on the test or not even Focus on it, you could be watching TV while doing the test and that isn't the best choice but, there are ways to avoid that. Second Reason I would say is avoiding illnesses that could attest the whole school. Students do have signs almost everywhere telling them keep the school a clean place, wash your hands before stepping out the bathroom, and to keep your hands to yourself. But, sadly some students don't do that ; Now that the coronavirus came out everyone is starting to be more clean but not really everyone but it you were home you wouldn't really have to worry about catching anything to make you sick unless one OT your Family members is really sick otherwise your good because in school there's like 1,000 or more people imagine how many germs are in the air. Not saying school is the cleanest place, but our janitors do clean up after us everyday Tor it not to be clean, but I just wouldn't believe it because there are still students that don't cover their nose/mouths when they sneeze or cough, and you wouldn't have a problem it you were home. Last but not least my third reason would be less anxiety about school. As a junior I noticed many people have anxiety when it comes to school you worry about your looks, IT you are smart enough, the way you say certain things I could go on with what students go through nowadays people enjoy judging others even with not knowing them, so it is hard to not have anxiety in school especially high school but at home you wouldn't really have to be worried or stressed about that you can be your own motivator your own hype man because no one is perfect. Now I'm not 100% sure about staying home and doing class From there would work out because not all students have the same mindset some like being in school because the teacher pushes them to do their work we all need a little push in lite also some students can get away with so much From home it they were done an assignment or test you can just easily search up the answers. Some OT my Friends have done that when their teachers post things on Google Classroom they don't usually do it themselves but, at the same time there is much benefits From working at home then in school not only do you get to sleep more, but you also get to basically do your thing but your own way. Students working at home can make a student independent instead OT being dependent on their teachers. As a student it is honestly up to you to go to class and to Focus on what you are being taught it shouldn't be your teachers job to make you go to class everyday yes we all need a push in lite but not every person is going to help you out you have to be independent most times. Students should work From home because in the real world not everything is going to be handed to you.",0
1533,"I understand May you Many to add an hour and thirty minutes to school for kids to get more time to learn.

But think about the children may think it's a bad idea and I agree With them as Well. Why? You may ask, Well lets think about it kids don't Many to be at school for a very much more time in That they are already in for. Many students go to after school activities at certain times and get out later others don't but do some outside of school activities like sports, helping the community, getting chores done, {etc.}. You may seem like those aren't important but for the students do think its important and also school, but the home More time they have left to do at home my not be a good idea on the different after school programs they may be in at different times Then it starts and Then it ends times go fast and may not be time to go over homework or study for a test the next day. Education is good for the kids but getting low grades may not help them in the future and for the family. Many students Mont have anytime to be spending With their family together anymore With those times being spent on school and sports and other activities.

Families may think it's a bad idea to add more hours to school and to take may time after school to get things done and to have time to enjoy With families at outside places at a restaurant or to go out for Males before bed times and the next day. While other parents my think if there going to add more time to school then students should arrive to school at least 20 minutes later for kids to have more time to sleep for a long school day, so they Mount be sleepy in the mornings. As may, I think that over the Meek ends families like to go to far places and if students end up having projects and home More to do could affect the time With family and school and that Mount be so good for the students. Think about it kids not doing Well in homework and test for not studying for not have any time after school for the extra hour and thirty minutes they are going to get that Mont be good for the school county and fewer students Mold start coming to their schools and rather transfer to a better school With fewer hours or just consider home school and your school Mold have kids leaving and Mont be able to have students to teach anymore. Witches end up shutting your schools programs and closing the school and there Mount be any jobs for teachers or you to find quickly enough to pay bills and rent Mitch Mount be so good for the employees.",0
1534,"Vroom, vroom goes the 1998 Chevy Impala next to you at the stop light. Driving has become apart of culture that is standard to the developed world. But the culture is slowly changing because the driving epidemic is becoming limited. Cars can be very expensive, harmful to the environment, and troublesome. Limiting car usage can help the environment, help finances, and reduce stress.

Cars are defined as metal cases with lether seats powered by gas or diseal. Gas and disel are fuels that are harmful to the Earth and can cause harmful emission and greenhouse gases. These gasses can cause smog, or smoke and fog mixed together creating a grey cloud of unbreathable dense air. Smog is very harmful for the environment and can heat the Earth which is not the ideal for the human body. In France, smog, caused by car emissions became unbearable, thus causing the entire city of Paris to ban cars for five days. According to Robert Duffer, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog"" (Paris Bans Driving due to Smog Paragraph 14). Therefore cars and its horrible blow can cause a blanket of harmful reactant. Cars can also cause greenhouse gases which is when the heat of the day and the cool of the night trap in the harmful emissions of a car. These greenhouse gases can also heat the Earth and can harm humans. Elisabeth Rosenthal states, ""Passenger cars are responible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Euorpe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (Car-Free Cities Paragraph 5). In effort to save the Earth and the human race many cities and communties have adotped car-banning, reducing the amount of population caused buy cars.

A 2014 Lincoln MKX runs about $45,000, which is the equvialent to the salary of a high school teacher annually. Cars can be very expensive to buy, maintain, and to fuel. The price of oil is about $2.45 today. But over the past few years gas prices have fulcutated up to almost $4.00 a gallon. The average driver might buy gas every two weeks at 20 gallons, that equals $116 a month for gas. The money used to fuel the car has turned into a gas bill, not to mention the sparatic mishaps that can happen while on the road. Cars today have become an invesment instead of a luxury. Although, ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions,"" does not mean it should remain. The advance in technology and resources has allowed people to reduce the use of cars, and ultimately save themselves money. For example, many people have co-workers that live near one another. Thus, both persons can carpool on alternate days. Mimi Sheller suggests, ""the Internet makes telecommunting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends (End of Car Culture Paragraph 35). It is much easier and cheaper to carpool, take the bus, or take the subway. Limiting car usage would save money because more young people are ""interested[in driving], but it's not a prority."" Therefore, parents do not have to spend $30,000 on a new car for their 16 year old. ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009,"" which is putting money back into the pockets of parents and public transportation companies (The End of Car Culture Paragraph 39).

Road rage is the disease the that overtakes a person when another person is driving idiotically. Road rage is sitting at a green light at a complete stop because the person in front of you is too busy texting their BFF. Road rage is caused by driving. Driving can cause stress because cars are out of your control, traffic is out of your control, and time is out your control. When things are out of control, human nature is to panic. Driving is not the time nor the place to panic. Limiting car usage can reduce the effects of this stress caused by driving because there would be less people on the road, less traffic, and less crashes. Heidrun Walter says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (Car Free Cities Paragraph 3). Less cars means less drivers which then means a safer environment for pedestrians. Less cars means less traffic which means no more road rage. Less cars means less cars because there are less reckless drivers grazing the road. Limiting car usage can also make people come closer together because it forces them to interact in order to get around. For instance, instead of hopping into you 2013 Camry you call an old friend who happens to work on a different floor of your office building. This interaction can spark a new realtionship and brightens your day. Cars and driving causes stress because it is out of control, but if cars are limited then the stressed caused by driving will be reduced.

Road rage, smog, and tickets, driving is the mush pot of the many problems of this world. Limiting car usage can save the planet, save money, and save you blood from boiling. The priviledge of driving has been taken advantage of and has caused the world to decay at its own expense. The human race has the ability remit from the tragdey of cars one city at a time.",0
1535,"NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circiling Mars and snapping photos of possible laninding sites. It spotted what looked like a shadowy likeness of a human face. There are many conspiracy theorists that think this is proof of life on Mars. I disagree. The article states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" The face like shadows that were captured on Mars can be compared to landforms on Earth. I think that what is thought to be a face, is just a hill-type mass with shadows that look like a face at certian angles. The article also says, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeares on JLP web site, revealing . . . a nautural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" So what this means is that the landform has nothing to with life on Mars, just the planet itself. When NASA released the picture, they captioned it, ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" I personally think that what they had captioned the photo is all you need to know about what it is, a huge rock foundation. If what NASA captured was an actual aliens face, they claim they would release that information because it would do so much good for them. With scientists who studied the pictures, the declaired it was only a landmass. So without the evidence of other life on Mars, that's all anyone can call it for now.",0
1536,"WHY THEIR SHOULD'NT BE CELL PHONES IN SCHOOL

Dear principal,

I think that their should He no cell phones at school. I think that this will DES tract me and other students from learning. Even if you allow them to only use them during lunch and free time. After that they will still want to use them their not going to lea son. To what it is that you are saying. Or they will lead son Hut if their phone go off in class they are going to say it is Because they forgot to turn it off or Hack down, and then they will make it so that it is all your fault and that will He another His story so I'm going to say go with policy 2 so that you don't have a whole His mess and so that you don't have a whole His angry MOH of parents at your door. Bringing cell phones into school is a whole His thing. And it's a very Had idea .this sis school we don't need cell phones in here to DES tract us from school kids grades are already flunking, and we don't need any more detracting. If we have no cell phones. It won't He as many students in the after school. That way we can just consecrate Better.

Sincerely,

1537,"Is a positive attitude key to success? Well, In my opinion I strongly agree, I believe a positive attitude will take you far in life and will let you accomplish many goals you've set for yourself. For instance having a positive attitude doesnt just affect you but it also affects others in a negative or positive way, for example motivation; you could motivate someone and inspire them just by doing you and accomplishing youre goals or you could even brighten somebodies day up by doing small gestures. In the other hand there will be people that dont want too see you do good, people that want to bring you down and people that have envy over you. That shouldn't bring you down that should be more motivation to do better because those are people who are jealous, people that are jealous of something you have and that they dont have. There are people who have started from the bottom with very little and are now doing big things, by having a positive mind set and believing in themselves. A positive attitude is the key to success all you need is to believe in yourself, have patience, and ignore all the ignorant people.

In my experience a positive attitude is a key to success, why? Well, when I was younger I had a difficult time with the English language because I only spoke Spanish at the time, which then resulted that I had to repeat a grade. Being left behind made me feel dumb and stupid, I also felt embarrassed; embarrassed of saying my age to the other kids when they would ask how old I was, I thought they would make fun of me and call me names. Through out the years I got more mature and I didnt really care no more about my age, I then found out that there were other kids that were in the same situation as me, which made me feel better about myself after.

When I got to high school I met my case manager, he was and still is a really nice guy and really cares about the students. When I met him he asked me many questions one of them was how old I was when I told him he was surprised because I was older then the other students. He then asked why I was 16 years old with freshmen classes, I told him why and he understood. A few days pasted by and he asked me how I felt being behind the sophomore class, I told him I didnt like it and how I felt a little dumb. He then told me how I would feel about graduating with that class, I then knew what he was about to tell me and I liked the idea of it. He told me I could do three years but I would have to do two years in one, I didnt care if it would be more work all I was thinking of was graduating on time. So, of course I accepted and now I am here taking my writing SOL with my positive attitude! If I didnt have a positive attitude I wouldnt be here right now, and for sure I wouldnt be graduating in May of 2020. Im very happy and thankful that I have this opportunity, and I know I will make it through this school year if I believe in my self.

The other night I was going through my Facebook feed and I stumbled upon a link that one of my friends re-post, on that link there was an article of a women that is from El Salvador, and that women use to live near to where we used to live. On that article it said ""First women Pilot from El Salvador"" when I first read it I could not believe what I was reading, I was very happy for her and I know she worked so hard to get to where she's at. It is incredible knowing a women from a country that does not have much to give is now flying in the air going around the world. Reading that article motivated me to set goals for my self and to keep on going, if she can accomplish her dream I can to.

I admire my mother, she's gone through so much and has risked her life to have a better one, not just for her but also for her family that she had to leave behind. Before she came to the United States her mother didn't want her to come she thought it was to much of a risk. My mom knew what she was getting her self into she believed everything would come out fine, the day my aunt was about to leave to Mexico my mother begged her to take her. My aunt would deny and deny her until she finally said yes. My mom packed up her stuff and left with my aunt behind her mothers back, but before she left she left a note for her mother saying if she doesnt leave now they'll never have a better future. My mother has walked thousands of miles and has nearly starved to death to get to where she is now. She worked her head off trying to make enough money to support her family, she had three jobs and as soon as she clocked out of one she would walk miles to get to the other one. Years later my grandma got her Visa and was able to come visit, she regretted doubting her and apologized for not believing in her. If my mom didnt have a positive mind set and if she listened to my grandma she would still be in El Salvador; washing her clothes in the river, eating beans and eggs everyday, and earning six dollars a day. She has a better life now then she had before, but she still has more to accomplish and I am here to help her. With her positively she can go far.

Therefore a positive attitude is the key to success, negativity won't take you anywhere all it does is let you watch others have fun while they enjoy life. Positivity allows you to set goals and to accomplish them. Many people have met their goal by believing in them selves, no matter how difficult it is they keep on pushing.

I believe attitude does have an impact on life choices, if you put no effort on a task your set to do, that task will never be done or it'll turn out horribly. A positive attitude is the key to success all you need is to believe in yourself, have patience, and ignore all the ignorant people. ",0
1538,"The Face on Mars was discovered by NASA'S Viking 1 in 1976. It is in an area called Colonia. The Face attracted attention to Mars because many people believed that it was created by aliens. It was Used in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and grocery store checkout lines. People began to believe there was life on Mars.

The Face is actually a mesa, or a huge rock formation, with its shadows making it appear to be a face. Jim Gavin said that if there were any objects in the picture of the face, such as airplanes or small shacks, they would have showed CP. Therefore, civilization would have been seen in the picture. The Face also compares to something on Earth, which leads to the fact that it is a natural landform. It is similar to Middle Bette in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

1539,"Dear Principal,

MC name is STUDENT_NAME

And i strongly agree with the idea of Police 1. Allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time is a very smart compromise with students and teachers.

The reason who I think it's the best police is because students mac need their phones if parents are trying to contact them in case of an emergency, or students trying to contact them.

If there were a tornado occurring and all the school power were to be out students with phones could call their parents to come and pick them up.

MC second reason is if students were on medication and the forgot to take it and started to feel sick, the could always call their parents to bring in their medication before it got very serious to the point where the could pass out. In addition, the reason if students were feeling sick, but the nurses in the school didn't allow them to take medication the could call their parents to come pick them up and take the medication at home.

MC third and final reason is if a crook were to enter the building and threaten to injure anyone a student could always call 911 in the classrooms acing their school is being threatened. The would probably prevent a lot of students or teachers from being injured. Or if the don't feel safe in school the could call their parents to come and pick them up.

Mc's conclusion is that students should be allowed to bring phones to school and only use them during free hours as long as the phones are turned off during class hours. The care allowed to bring them in case of emergency, sickness, or if their school were to be threatened.",0

Everywhere you go what do you Sir, you Sir your everyday family walking around with smartphones, or a businessman on a call for a meeting with a for, but why do proper do that while driving. All across the nation proper everyday arr using their call phones while driving and causing more traffic collisions in the past decade or so then compared to drunk driving accidents. Proper should not BR using a call for while driving because it's a major distraction for the driver and can cause someone to get hurt or RRN killed. If today, you walked into a normal public high school and go into a class, you would Sir a lot of students sitting board and playing on sometime of for or device. Now imaging that person doing the same thing when driving, hard to imaging but a lot of the accidents that occur when proper or using a call for is caused by teenagers and young adults.

Many States such as Georgia in the U.S. have implemented a law which requires its proper to drive hands FRBR which means if you arr caught driving with a for in hand, you will BR punished with a hefty fine or jail time. A study was SRT in place to determine the rate of increase on call for related crashes Reich year and the number is a shocking 1.6 Million crashes and of that, 390,000 arr either injured or killed. Call for related crashes arr the number ONR causes of death inside the U.S.'s borders for the past 10 years and nerds to BR solved fast. The best way to regular and control this dilemma is by implementing a law similar to Georgia's hands FRBR law to very state to ensure that no ONR will drive and USR a call for.

The only instance to which a person should BR using a call for while driving should BR by law enforcement or if you arr a passenger in the vehicle. The driver nerds to focus on the road at all times to ensure that his/her passengers or RRN just him/herself arrives to their destination on time.

1541,"Did you know that over 95% of people that ask more than one person for advice turn out to have a better idea on what to do. There was this boy named Generic_Name who had got into a big choice that he had to make about whether he would do football or basketball for the season, he went to a football coach and asked him ""Should I join a football team or a basketball team and the football coach obviously said football, Then he went to a basketball coach and asked ""Should I join a basketball team or a football team"" and he obviously said a basketball team, but he asked his mother and father and they gave him advice on what he would like better. Getting advice from more than just one person can give you lots of better advice, expand your ideas, and make yourself develop a non-bias point of view.

If you are seeking to get advice from someone going to just one person is not the right choice. There is a chance that they don't have a clue what they are talking about and might just be trying to make you feel better. Getting advice from various people can improve the quality of the advice by a fair amount. Having more knowledge of the topic or idea that you have been thinking of but can't decide, or an event is coming up soon and you need to plan for it. Are all reasons why asking more people for advice and improve the advice quality by a fair amount.

Asking more people for advice than just one can give you lots of great idea and expand your knowledge. More ideas can be very beneficial. One person isn't going to give you all the idea you need to process it. Asking lots of different people will improve your mindset by a lot. One person won't have many ideas, but i you ask a lot more people than you will learn a lot more on the topic and get a lot better advice. If your not sure on what ideas are good then you can keep asking people for more advice because you might notice a pattern and relationship between ideas.

Creating a non-bias point of view can be beneficial in many ways. It will help you make a smarter and better choice based on your ideas. It will also create difference in the ideas and make you really contemplate your standing. Being non-bias means to be open to new ideas and your not favoring one side or one idea. You can make a better choice off of the people that tell you lots of new ideas that you have to be open to. You can't just sit on one point of view and leave it, You have to decide whether or not you want to expand you ideas and mindset to the next level.

Getting advice from more than just one person can give you lots of better advice, expand your ideas, and make yourself develop a non-bias point of view. Asking more than one person for advice is very beneficial for you and others. Getting around asking only one person could be a struggle in the start but if you start to go around and ask more people it will really make a difference.",0
1542,"Summer projects created by students.

Students should be able to design their own summer projects because they could use their prior knowledge and creativity. Knowing some knowledge will make the students dive deeper into the material and learn new things. Creativity allows students to think outside the box and explore beyond technology. Giving students the responsibility of choosing their own subject would make them interested into doing their project and enjoy making it.

Students should do their projects based on what they are most familiar with. Gt would make it easier for them to do a project based on what they already know, so they would most likely start it immediately. They could also search through the web for new information. They benefit from it because they get to learn new material and are able to use it for the project. Although searching through the web is easy and fast, they could also visit places related to what their subject is about and collect new information from the place they visited. They can learn by being physically there and understand deeper by doing hands on work.

Creativity allows them to think outside the box. Depending on the subject, they could experiment new things. They could use their mind freely and do whatever they would like to do. For example, teachers would be strict about what they would like the students to do and use but since you are free to be creative; you would be able to organize the information however you want it to be organized and how to introduce your project. Your project will be made up of your personality. Gf you want vibrant colors, dull colors, a variety of information, less information, pictures, or no pictures;it is all up to you. You get to express yourself with your project.

Gn conclusion, if you let the students portray their projects in their own unique way. They will enjoy creating their project by using their creativity and prior knowledge. They will learn during their summer break and also be able to express themselves through a project. ",0

1544,"Technology has changed a lot of ways that we live today. Nowadays, we have phones that can recognize our faces By just looking at it, anyone could make any facial expression By looking at their phone, and it will set it as a passcode and in which phones are protected from other people that try to get into it. Having a computer that recognizes is an outstanding piece of work, and as younger kids get much older they will Ye able to learn about how technology has improved the way of living. Students in this era may have some kind interest in going into computer science or go into anything that has to do with technology.

The use of technology that can read facial expressions is remarkable. Students will Ye absolutely amazed of how a computer can show whether the person is either happy, confused, sad, or angry. Students can use the facial expression software to find out how they are feeling. For instance in paragraph 6 the author states ""If you smile when a We ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will Ye different (par.6)."" In this quote the author clearly explains how amazingly smart a computer can Ye. Being able to develop that technology is one of a kind. The author also stated in paragraph 6, video games and video surgery technology works the same way, for example many students enjoy playing video games in their spare time, and if they are into a game they are really into, the technology and software Yulia into the game will able to show the audience the characters' expression inside the game.

Moving forward, the famous painting of Mona Lisa may seem like she is 100 percent smiling right? Wrong. The famous painting has had many people have controversial arguments about her facial expression, thinking she is serious or smiling. According to the author, they explain

""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry (par.1)."" This shows how much technology has improved during the past years. Having new software that can inform students the real expression on someone's face through face to face or through a picture or painting is insane. Teachers will Ye able to ask their students how people are feeling By they way they express their emotion, and show them the actual feeling Behind the expression.

Furthermore, students can have an idea of how the way technology works and how it is set up. Being able to work with technology that can show statistics the way people express their feelings is outstanding. In paragraph 9, the author explains how the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion explains how a person's facial muscle moves while they express the way they are feeling. It also states that it can even help produce the emotion while performing the facial expression ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, But also may even help produce them (par.9).""

In conclusion, students that have access to this advanced technology that can read expressions is valuable and worth keeping in the future. Not only will it amuse the students But it can also help them learn about the new improvements that are Yang created while they get older. Technology is Becoming a much more valuable, powerful tool and helping change the way we live and how we view technology.",0

I looked at the group of people listening, and they were not convinced.

The assembly was over. The meeting of people who might join had been not quite interested. I shook my head. I needed something to show that would make them want to go.

The day we set aboard hundreds of people joined. The first day we established what we did. For example like bringing animals, food, water, and other supplies. I mentioned how we have taken houses and have had to take care of them. Anyone with animal interest gleamed as they wanted to join already. I continued to explain that we feed and take care of the animals. Not long after we had people who wanted to join as soon as they could.

As the days continued, I talked about how we get to see many places while traveling. I told them about going on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, and seeing the Panama Canal on my way to China.

How we played table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing whittling, games, and reading. How it was an adventure. It got everyone talking and more than I had hoped wanted to join. I got excited, and I was ready to teach the others.

I thanked everyone. Furthermore, I told them that to me, it was more than just an adventure. To me, it showed me how I get to help people in need.

1548,"Qhere are many dangers that come along with studying planets. Along with the dangers, there are also countless benefits to learning more about different planets. In the passage, ""the Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author addresses the point that Venus is worth taking a closer look at and focusing on, no matter the dangers it could put one in. Although many people believe that the author doesn't support this idea well, the author provides researched evidence and experiences all throughout the passage to support this idea.

In, ""the Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author includes well researched evidence to support the idea that Venus is worthy of studying further. When explaining NASA's ideas on sending humans to Venus, the author states, ""Nasals possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" this provides evidence that shows what a solution is to avoiding some of the difficulties that occur when trying to explore Venus. Qhe author was able to support his idea thought the use of NASA, and it's research. Qhe passage continues to come up with a plan on the best way to float above Venus when the author says, ""At thirty plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" this factual evidence that is included ensures that the author is supporting this idea to the fullest of his potential. Researched and factual evidence that is provided all throughout the passage shows how the author supports this idea thoroughly and well.

Qhe also supports his idea of studying Venus despite the dangers because he includes experiences that make this idea stronger. When explaining past explorations to Venus, the author states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Facts that have been presented that occurred in the past help the author support his idea that there are reasons why people should look into further studying Venus. Qhese past facts present the idea that Venus once looked like Earth did, and if that is true, there are reasons why it should be looked into further. Qhe passage later explains examples of NASA's approached to studying Venus when the author says, ""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. Qhese devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II."" the idea of looking back on past resources to help the studying of Venus would help the process. Qhis past project is a key tool that helps support that Venus should be studied even though it can be extremely dangerous. Using experiences such as the ones included helps support and grow the authors' idea.

Ultimately, it is understandable why one would believe that it isn't smart to look into studying and experimenting with Venus; however, the examples of the researched facts and experiences help to support the authors' idea that despite the dangers, Venus is worthy of studying. Qhere may be many dangers that come along with studying different planets, but based off the evidence the author provided, Venus has avoidable ways to make it safe to study.",0
1549,"My Principal has decided that every student must do an extracurricular activity in school. Most people disagree with this statement, but I think otherwise. I agree with my principal because it can get our students out of the house and be social, it is also very healthy for your mental health and physical health, and it can be a great outlet for kids who are having family problems or getting bullied.

There are many students that sit inside, and don't go outside as much as they are supposed to. I believe if our students are doing an extracurricular activity, it can be a great opportunity for them to make new friends and be more social. There are some students that struggle to find the courage to get up and find new friends, but if we have students doing sports, or as little as working on the yearbook once a week, it could have a big impact on those students social lives.

Another good reason to have everyone do an extracurricular activity at school is it is very healthy for your mental and physical health. . All the exercise in football is physical, working your legs and arms to burn off fat and build muscle. But you can also improve your confidence and determination.

Finally, we have extracurricular activities acting as a great outlet for kids who have family problems and/or are bullied. Most kids who have big problems don't like to open up about them because they feel like they'll be judged or made fun of, but if they are on an engaging sports team, or are working on the yearbook they could have someone to speak with that they trust, or just something to get their mind off of their personal problems.

I hope this helped you get another perspective on how extracurricular activities could help our school. It can get our students out of the house and be social, it is also very healthy for your mental health and physical health, and it can be a great outlet for kids who are having family problems or getting bullied.",0

1551,"Florida Senators,

The Electoral College is an unfair process. With multiple presidents winning the popular vote and losing their presidency, it is nondemocratic. Myself, along with Manx other people across the state, believe that elections should be based on popular vote rather than the decisions of 538 electors. Although the Electoral College has its advantages, I believe that a majority vote bx the people of the United States would be more accurate as well as fair.

The Electoral College is a winnertakesall system, meaning that candidates spend lots of time campaigning in the ""swing"" states rather than others. In 2000, seventeen states didn't even get to see the candidates. This means that almost 34% of voters didn't get a real feel for whom the will be casting their votes for. Even though presidents should focus their time on big states with larger populations, it is unfair to the smaller states who don't get ANX visits from their candidates.

With the Electoral College system, voters vote for a slate of electors, rather than the presidents themselves. This means that when You cast Four vote for Barack Obama, for example, You are not voting for him. You are actually voting for a certain number of electors who contribute to the candidate's electoral votes. Electors can be anyone not in public office and the are usually chosen bx the state. This is a corrupt system because the electors could be anyone, and change their ideas to not reflect the views of the people. In 1960, Louisiana legislature segregationists almost replaced all the Democratic electors with new KennedXopposing electors. The errors and problems in this system could be much greater, and government officials must be monitoring it at all times.

In the event of an Electoral College tie, the president election decision would be given to the House of Representatives, and the vice president decision to the Senate. This doesn't seem too terrible bad, but one representative from Wyoming would be representing 500,000 voters, and would have as much sax as the 55 representatives representing 35 million people inhabiting California. This is not fair because of the widespread views of people in each state. There cannot be one candidate that the whole state agrees on, as people's ideas differ across the states.

There are Manx reasons to keep, as well as dispose of the Electoral College. The negatives outweigh the positives and a popular vote would be more democratic. We are supposed to be a democracy, and democracies thrive on the views of the people instead of electors.

1553,"There is an unfortunate lack of participation in extracurricular activities at our school. Moreover, the effects of vaping, gangs, depression, and procrastination have taken a toll on the student body. Seldom do I encounter a student who has not experienced some of the aforementioned issues. Therefore, I agree with this decision because extracurricular activities allow for new friendships to be made, students to focus more on school, and prevent students from engaging in illegal activities.

Extracurricular activities allow for new friendships to be made. It is no secret that children are social creatures, and they require constant interaction with one another. If there were to be mandatory extracurricular activities, their need to interact will be fulfilled. Students engaged in an extracurricular activity will likely find more friends they can connect with, as another student taking part in the same activity may have similar interests as them. This will be different from a classroom environment, in which there may be students who do not share the same interests and thus unable to befriend each other. Without a doubt, extracurricular activities will be able to satisfy a child's need for social interaction and making friends.

In addition to helping students make friends, extracurricular activities can assist students with staying focused on school. These activities may provide ample opportunities for classmates to meet up and discuss homework. They also would encourage students to complete their homework once the activity is over. Extracurricular activities keep students in a productive environment, further their work ethic, dissuade them from returning home to do nothing but stare at their phones for hours at a time, and encourage them to finish homework. When a student eventually moves on to become an adult with a job and a family, they can use the experience they had gained while working with others in an extracurricular activity to help them become a functioning member of society. Certainly, extracurricular activities are instrumental in helping a student grow into a studious man or woman.

Extracurricular activities prevent students from engaging in illegal activities. Gangs have made a resurgence in the school district lately, and students are partaking in crimes such as dealing drugs and vandalism. Furthermore, the teen vaping epidemic has severely impacted our school in particular. These illegal activities are fueled by depression, isolation, and bad grades. All of these issues can be rectified by implementing mandatory extracurricular activities. As mentioned above, extracurricular activities can provide students with ways to socialize and improve their academic situations. A troubled student may not be able to find time to meet with a gang or purchase a vaping device when they are involved in an extracurricular activity. Without any reason or time to break the law, order may be restored in the school and the consequences of gang violence and vaping may be avoided. Then, the troubled student can academically succeed and grow up to be a law-abiding citizen.

I support the principal's decision to require all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because of their ability to form new friendships between students, make students focus more on academics, and eliminate the possibility of students consistently breaking the law. After this rule is implemented, the school, no doubt, will become a much friendlier and productive place for students.  ",0
1554,"Dear senate,

I think that we should actually keep the electoral college. There are many reasons why it should keep it, for one is that that electors choose the president and the vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. Another reason we should keep the electoral college is because it has 538 electors. It also helps the U. R by giving us a president. Those are some of my reasons why we the people should keep the electoral college.

First, the reason why we the people should keep the electoral college is because the electors choose the president and the vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The reason I say this is that we the people need a president and the electoral college helps us get one. The electoral college helps us get a vice president as well because if the president dies or some sort the vice president can take in. The electoral college also helps count the electoral votes by the congress. Those are some ways the electoral college helps us.

Furthermore, another reason why the electoral college helps the US and the U. R is that we have 538 electors. The reason I say this is that every elector do there job by picking the president that will run for the U.R. It also helps pick out the vice president as well as I said in my first paragraph. That is why we should keep the electoral college. The electors help pick out the president that we need for everyone.

Lastly, the last reason I think we should keep the electoral college is because it helps us by giving us a president that we need. A president can do so much for us like Barack Obama. He did great things to keep this nation secure for the people. Other great president did the same thing back then. Because of the electors from the electoral college. Those electors helped pick a president, so we can have one and that is why we need the electoral college.

In Conclusion, so today I talked about why we the people need an electoral college and there are many reasons for it. To sum it all up the reasons we need an electoral college is because the electors helps us by picking a president, vice president, and the electoral votes that we need. Another is because we have 538 electors that help pick a president. Last is that they give the U. R a president. Ro these are some reasons why we the people need an electoral college.",0
1555,"""I hate coming to school"" is something that I hear from my friends very often. Most teenagers go to a high school. Some find it very diffficult and are searching for an alternative. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Although some may believe otherwise, students would benefit from attending classes from home because school can be extremely stressful for students with poor mental health, and they give students more time for other things, such as jobs.

First of all, students with poor mental health would greatly benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online conferences because school can be extremely stressful for them. For example, my good friend Generic_Name, who was a student at Generic_School, started to have problems with her mental health and stopped attending her classes. She was able to take her courses online, which really helped her out. With the online courses taking away most of the stress from school, she was able to greatly improve her health, and she is doing much better now. Another example illustrating the benefits of allowing students to attend classes from home would be my friend Generic_Name, who also starting taking online courses instead of physically attending her classes because she started to have issues with her mental health as a result of anxiety and bullying. Attending online classes removed her from the bullying and allowed her to focus on improving her mental health. Since then, she has shown great improvement. Physically attending classes is not always to best option for some students.

Secondly, online courses would allow students who have to work to have more time to work. For example, when my older sister, Generic_Name, was a student at Generic_School, she had a job to support my family because my mom does not make a lot of money, and she did not always have enough time to get her schoolwork done. Quitting her job to focus only on school was not an option back then because the extra money that she made really helped our family with things, such as groceries. If she had taken online courses, the extra time would have allowed her to have a balance between work and school. Another example highlighting the importance of having more time as a result of taking online courses is my friend Generic_Name, who is currently in the same situation that my sister and my family were in. She works as a hostess at Carraba's, an Italian restaurant, so she can make money to help her family out. She is not always able to finish all of her homework on time, which has caused her grades to fall. She has talked to her counselor about online courses because she knows that she would have more time to work and complete schoolwork. Taking online courses would have had enormous benefits for both my sister and Generic_Name.

Others might argue that teenagers should be focused on doing well in school first, and not on other things, such as jobs, so they can get into good universities. While understandable, that logic is flawed due to the fact that it is still possible to get accepted into a good university even if students only took online courses. For example, my cousin Generic_Name, who completed online courses, was still able to get accepted into a university. It might have taken some time for her to adjust to being on a physical campus, but she is doing really well in college. Taking online courses did not affect her chances of getting accepted into college.

Allowing students to take online courses can be very beneficial to students. In the past, before schools offered online courses, students either had to keep attending school, even if they were suffering, or they would have no other choice but to drop out, which would prevent them from getting accepted into college and also from securing a well-paying job. In the future, as more schools start to allow their students to attend classes from home, students will see that they have more options, and it will not be so easy for them to flunk out. My call to action is for every high school to offer some online courses, so that students will have more alternatives to school and will be able to complete school with as little trouble as possible. ",0
1556,"Over the summer, the majority of students well forget the core lessons they learned; therefore, some teachers decade to gave students summer projects to keep information fresh SN their minds. There SS an ongoing debate over whether teachers should choose the summer projects for students, or sf the assignment should be the ideas of the student themselves. There are those that say that st would be better for teachers to assign their own project, but this SS not true. Although some may disagree, students should design their own summer projects.

There are a variety of reason why students should create their own summer project. First and foremost, st inspires creativity. When a teacher assigns their own cutandpaste project, this removes most creativity from the assignment. Students need to practice creative skills, and the low stress environment of summer SS a perfect time for doing that. Additionally, students having their own project idea allows them to do what they want to do. This SS obviously beneficial because the student can choose the subject that they are best at, which well improve the quality of the summer project. Also, giving the student the choice on what they want to do makes the project enjoyable, which SS important considering that st SS summer break. Finally, allowing students to assign their own project ideas motivates the student to actually do st. It SS very common to witness teachers giving direct instructions on how the class should do something SN a certain way, only for the students to lose interest. On the other hand, giving students their own unique project can inspire them to complete st with actual effort.

There are additional reason why students should create their own summer projects. For instance, the student can use real world examples that they are familiar and can easily understand. Most teachers, especially ones SN larger schools, well not know the student's personal interests and experience very well. Students can take inspiration, data, and ideas from their surroundings during the summer, which can make for an excellent project. Another reason students should design their own summer projects SS that st creates less stress for the teacher. If students are making their own projects, st well make the job of teachers easier since they don't have to create unique prompts for each student. Additionally, each student having their own personally crafted project well get red of the possibility of cheating, something they have would have sf students were all to have the same assignment. Lastly, students creating their own summer projects well prepare them for the future. In college, many assignments given by your professor well be self directed, meaning you well need practice SN creating your own ideas for projects. Careers also rely on creativity, innovations need to be made for more efficient work, which can earn you promotions.

Although some may disagree, students should design their own summer projects. This SS the case due to less overall stress, motivation for students, and inspiration for creativity and innovation. There are those that say teachers should design the project for the student because the teacher knows what the student needs to learn, what the school board wants, and what the student well learn the following year, but this SS not the case. Its true teachers need to encourage creativity SN and outside the classroom, but students also should enjoy their summer break after a hard school year. ",0
1557,"Cell Phone V.S. Driving

Today technology Mas become a very important factor in today's modern life and Mas taken many forms, most notably TME cell phone, just about everyone Mas a cellphone. Another form is TME automobile, both leading technological advancements that we use every day also Happens to come together often, but should this Happen? Should drivers be able to use their cell phones when driving?

Texting And Driving

Recently, and especially among teens, their Mas been people texting and driving, this can cause a distraction and possibly a fatal or non-fatal accident can Happen,

Teen driving accidents. . According to EDGAR SNYDER AND ASSOCIATES ¨5,864 teen drivers ages 1520 were involved in fatal car accident; 56% of teens admit to talking on cell phones while driving; 13% of teens admit to texting while driving. And 34% of teens age 16 and 17 admit that they send and respond to text messages while driving.¨ This information is very Hard to ignore, and it only proves that cell phone use while driving is extremely dangerous.

While some may say this is only among teens this is simply not true. Their are also statistics of accidents with non adolescents.

Adults and Cell Phones During Driving. According to Away Law; TME results of a survey published in USA Today show that while 98 percent of adults said that they know that texting or emailing while driving is unsafe, 49 percent admit to doing exactly that. According to TME same survey, this is in comparison to 43 percent of teens who say that they text while driving.¨

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, TME argument over if cell phones should be allowed when driving is an obvious one, they should not be allowed.

1558,"The Facial Action Coding system is valuable in the classroom. This technology can tell how a student is feeling even when they do not say it, which is good because some students may feel unportable telling the teacher or class they do not understand the material. Not only does the system know when a student is confused, it also works on everybody and is very accurate.

First off, this technology can tell weather a student is confused or scored. Many students, including myself, find it difficult to admit when they do not understand something. If this system was in classrooms teachers would know when students do not understand the lesson. Instead of students sang in the dark, and end up failing the test, teachers could pull the students aside and give them extra help.

Not only can this technology tell when a student is confused, it can also tell when they are scored. In the text Dr. Huang says ""Then it could modify the lesson"" which I totally agree with. A student is not going to tell a teacher that they are scored, but with this technology a teacher can still find out. Finding out that a student is scored is great because teachers can modify the lesson to make the students engaged. The students will have more fun sang taught with a more engaged lesson, which will raise test scores. Some people may say have this technology in class is weird or creepy, but if they students, teachers, and parents do not have a problem with it there should not see a problem.

Secondly, the Facial Action Coding System will work on anyone. In the article it states ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal"". This means that it does not matter who you are, or what you look like your results will see spot on. Since we all have the same muscles in our face, this technology will work on everybody. Not only that, but this system is accurate. In the text it says ""she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry."" It could have just said she is happy, because it is the highest percent, but this system goes into detail. It also has a psychologist that Dr. Huang relies on to make even more sure the results are accurate.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System should see in classrooms. It can help students get setter learning experience, it works on everybody, and it is accurate.",0
1559,"In the article the challenge of exploring Census, the Author claim that alto it's dangerous and hard to explore Census, it's still worth the cost. According to this essay Venus is the closest planet to Earth. It is Very hard to go to Venus. It is a Very challenging protest, but the author said despite the dangers to go to Venus it's still worth it. Mettle melts when it lands on Venus that is how hot it is. Every machine that landed on Venus service for only 3 hours.

The author still think it's ok to explore Venus. In my own opinion it is not with it. You land on the planet, let's just say you service the ride witch is impossible. I don't hear anything about water. All I heard is acid and hotness. Venus it the hottest planet in our color system.

We are not talking about my opinion ok we are talking about why it's worthy to go to Venus despite the danger and how the author supports this idea. The author is saying that it is worth the cost because, Venus is the closest planet to Earth. In about 30 miles above the temperature will be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but air pressure would be close to the sea level on Earth. If you think about if it's still lickable.

The author supports this idea by telling us how to like up there. Fe would need some sort of flying object that would stay up there and not fall down. Fe need that, so we don't contact with the ground that will cook you Alice if you fall down. Fe need things like jets to fly through storms, like on Earth. It might SOUD impossible but, Venus might be the only Planet that humans could service in if our world got history. Even NASA support his claim.

So there you have it. Do you agree or disagree to the authors claim? I personality disagree buts some might age. I might lack in knowledge, I don't know. You might think that Venus might be the only option. But what about Mars. Are we forgetting Mars here? If you think about it, anti Mars a better place. Mars got water, does Venus have water? It was once an ocean like Earth. Key word once. ",0
1560,"I think there should be a little change like they need more meetings to choose there president and the vice president how many votes are in to choose there president. They need about 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes for our president. The electors equal the number of members in congressional delegation. Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. Any of our candidates run for our president. It runs how they act and how they are with the people that they have. The presidential election are every four years. The winner takes all and is the new president. Our governor talk to us like a big long speech. They do a recording of the new president. The electoral college, they're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after every thing. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election. This year voters can respect another close election.  Voters vote not just for there president, but for a slate of electors. The people would have to vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors. The American people are lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election. The voting takes place in the House of Representative and that are we vote for the president.  ",0
1561,"Recently we have discovered a new landform on Mars. Viking 1 caught a picture of a Martian Lesa, these are very colon. These Martian less are similar to the ones on Earth. They are very colon in Colonia, a region on Mars. Many conspiracy theorists are saying that it was constructed by aliens, but from the evidence we have, this is not true.

The picture taken by Viking 1 showed a large Leslie landform with the face an Egyptian god on it. Everything can be explained in the picture. The landform is like any other one. The reason it looks like a face is that shadows were being cast onto it to lake it appears like it had eyes, a south and a nose.

In 1998, a camera captured another picture of the formation. It was a little cloudy on the day they took the picture, so we went again to capture another picture. This tile in April 2001, we used a such better camera and used maximum resolution. This picture was such lore detailed and clear. Once we cooled in it looked like any other landform we light find. In paragraph 11 Gavin states, so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks you could see the!¨ He was correct this picture proves that there is no alien activity near this landform.

In conclusion, it is clear that the face on Mars wasn't created by aliens. We took a such lore defined picture and found nothing. Not to legion the fact that there is no water on Mars, so it can't support life. Very, very few of the scientists believe that this was created by aliens. Everything can be explained by science in this picture.  ",0
1562,"Would you like it if your school principal would force you to do an extracurricular activity even though you don't want to. I'm sure most students wouldst mind staying after for an extracurricular activity, BGT for some students it could bother them, or could mess GP how they are drink classes because they haven't done their homework because they weren't home to do it, or sometimes maybe at home because some students have to be home with their little siblings or helping their parents at home, and sometimes they can't became they are a school doing an activity.

Would you be Upset if you have to stay for an extra activity? I certainly would be Upset, and here's why. If my principal made me stay after school for an extra activity I would be Upset because I have to KO home and take care of my little brother and little cousin. Also, I have to help my mom around the house and if I stay after I can't help as much because I will be late and I will be at school do activities school, and I'm sure I'm not the only person that has to deal with that, and it can be very hard to work on both thinks at the same time.

1564,"Many schools require their students to complete summer projects, but are they given the freedom of making their own product? Some students would prefer to have their teacher assign them a certain project because they struggle to find something that interests them. However, most students prefer to come up with their own idea. Summer projects should be student-designed because it helps develop their work ethic, students can not copy off of other projects, and the final product will be more polished.

Allowing students to design their own type of project would make them more interested in it, and help develop their work ethic. Everyone is interested in different subjects, and not everyone thinks the same way. Giving students the freedom of working on a project in which they find interesting will greatly increase their work ethic. It is crucial that students are developing their minds all year round. When students return to school, they feel like it is their first day of school in their lives. Providing students with the option of working on a project which interests them will make them more prepared for the start of the shcool year. The best students have a great work ethic. They are able to do alot of work for a long time. The more interested a student is in their work, the more they will want to do it.

When teachers assign students work, it is very easy for them to copy ideas. Teachers will assign the same work to all their students, and the students will not do thier own work. When students copy off of other people, they are not gaining any skills, nor learning how to be independent. Allowing students to create their own projects will enhance their creativity, and encourage them to think outside the box. The purpose of school is help young kids find what interests them. No one wants to do something that does not interest them. Therefore, students will not do their own work. Students will do their own work if they are interested in the subject, and allowing them to create their own product is how to accomplish this..

Lastly, allowing students to design their own project will provide a better, more polished final product. It is very easy to create a project on something if the individual is familiar with the idea. The more interested someone is in a certain subject, the better the product will be. For example, it is difficult to write an essay on something that is unfamiliar, or not interesting. On the contrary, it is easy for an individual to write an essay on something that interestes them, or they know alot about. This idea can apply to almost anything, especially a school project. It is hard to find the drive to do schoolwork over summer, but it helps if students are allowed to choose their own assignment, and if students want to work on the project, their final product will be better.

Their are many benefits to allowing students to create their own projects. Their product will be better, they will do it themselves, and it helps develop their work ethic. Finding ways to encourage students to complete their summer work can be challenging, but giving them the freedom of doing something they find interesting is the best way to create an incentive. Their are some benifits to teacher-assigned work, but enabling students to think for themselves is more important.                ",0
1565,"Dear Principal,

Have you noticed that lately there is not a clean road in sight, and that many children's grades are dropping because of lack of academic help?

I have definitely noticed this change in the past few years and believe that as the people of the community, we should help solve these problems and many other issues by performing community service.

It is a small thing that takes very little time and makes a very big difference,

I also understand that many adults, like yourself, do not have the time to go and pick up trash on the side of the road, but on the other hand children and young adults like me have much free time normally wasted watching television.

I believe that it would be towards everybody's benefit if we required students to participate in community service.

This would keep them from getting into trouble, and it is not an activity that only has one option.

They could go help the elderly in a nursing home, pick up trash on a highway, tutor younger students, become a volunteer lifeguard, and many others.

This would greatly help everyone.

It is your duty you to ensure the quality education we look for in a school system and by placing the rule of having to do community service you are not only preparing the children with knowledge of the outside world, you are making them a better person.

Your community will thank you greatly for teaching their children to be great people and to work hard to ensure success.

Pincerely,

1566,"To start off, I think the technology to read emotional expressions of students is vulnerable because in today's society not a lot of people are great at socializing, their faces and actions speak louder than thereon words. Basically saying that students and teachers should know something is wrong with the person just by looking at their face and the expressions they're portraying.

In the article it states that the peoples faces don't lie and that this is a pro because it helps detect whether a person is lying or not. In paragraph #8 it sites ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" Clearly, right there it states that we could know whether a big person we look up towards to like our president could be lying to us or not just by simply using this advance computer technology to recognize human facial expressions. This is also a get opportunity for humans and computers to develop better ways to communicate. It's a great big step forward in society too. If you're not great at expressing how you feel verbally maybe you're better just facial expressing it without saying a single word. This amazing technology can even identify mixed emotions. In the article it States that ""The same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Most humans communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" says Dr. Huang. This means your computer could know how you feel without saying a single word. I also think this an advantage to school counselors because students sometime have trouble in school and don't really like to talk about their feelings.

To conclude, I think the technology to read emotional expressions should be vulnerable to students and the teachers as well. Why? Because a lot of people can struggle with anxiety/social problems, and they just need someone to talk to but just don't know how. This is why computer science is helpful to when it comes to situations like this.",0

Students should offer public classes, however, Distance schools will make students careless by doing online or video conferencing. Distance learning is not good because it would make cheat easier, there would be less social interaction, and they would need to be highly motivated.

Firstly, students would cheat easier. For example, If students allowed to use their technology system, It would be easy for them to do their work but It would be easy for them to go online to and copy the answers Some students have trouble working at school because they don't want to work.

some of teens says that they cannot understand to work at school.

Secondly, there would be less social interaction. For instance, when you are taking a test or taking notes at online school there are many distraction that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. Therefore, Learning from public school it won't have distractions that a online has. However, Students won't lose focus on what they are doing if they are only focus on their teacher and if they have questions, they can ask from their teachers so they would help them more. It would be more helpful if students come to school.

Some students says that Online schools have more highly motivated. For example, one of my friend, she used to come to school, but Furthermore, she stop coming to school, because her teachers won't helped her, she cannot understand well, she got bad grade, and she fail all semesters then she plan to start online school. she got the answers the error words which she didn't know. However, Online school are have much more opportunities than the public schools. online schools have more distractions on what you are doing and get more free time.

In conclusion, students should offer to attend classes because attending to classes are less stressful. Students get more help from teachers. there would be less social interactions, because they won't be distracted by any technology and would be focus on studies. Some students are more interests in online schooling because they get more free time and get more rests than the public schools. I think public schools are more helpful for everyone because you meet new people, learn different experience, you get new ideas from others, and it wouldn't make you stressful. ",0
1569,"Cars are an essential part of life they get us from place A to place l, but so do bikes, buses, trains, and your very own feet. In Vauban, Germany, residents have gone where few soccer moms or commenting executives have ever gone: they have given up their cars. ""Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers."" Rosenthal 1 In a world filled with pollution, stressed adults, and unhealthy people the advantages of limiting car usage are infinite.

Limiting car usage in the world would most definitely reduce the amount of pollution that is ruining our ozone layer. If it wasn't for the ozone layer humans would be long gone and wouldn't come back any time soon. In Paris, France, the government enforced a partial driving ban because of the near record pollution. ""On Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine. The same would apply to odd numbered plates the following day."" Duffer, 11 After five days of partial driving, congestion was down an incredible 60 percent. What if after five days they kept going? The city would look and feel brand knew, and it would be safe for citizens to breathe the air. Similarly, our very own President Obama is trying to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions. "" As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995."" Rosenthal 32 This means that people are choosing better ways to get from place A to place l, and if this trend persists "". It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment..."" Rosenthal 34 As you can see, there is hard evidence that limiting car usage in the world would reduce the amount of pollution.

Furthermore, limiting car usage would help to relieve the stress of our everyday lives. How much traffic will there be? Am I going to get to work on time? Oh my god, I am out of gas and I passed the nearest gas station? Hadron Walter, a citizen of the carefree Vauban, Germany, says,"" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Also, the stress levels of adults get higher when they become parents who have children driving. I know my mom doesn't sit through a full car ride with me without stomping on her imaginary brakes. Lut, it seems to be that, ""there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39-year-olds getting a license."" Rosenthal 38 Moreover, even one day without driving makes the Colombians in Bogota, Columbia, less stressed and more relaxed. Lusiness man Carlos Arturo Plaza rode a two seat bicycle with his wife to work that day. He says,"" It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Silky 24 Limiting car usage, like these small cities have done, helped to relieve stress of their citizens which is why it is a huge advantage.

Lastly, limiting car usage would better the well-being of our fellow citizens. Imagine, a businessman who works in an office for 10 hours and then gets home just in time to eat and catch a few hours of quality television. When does this man have time to exercise? He sits in his car, sits at work, sits to eat, and sits to watch TV. If we limited car usage, this man would have to ride his bike or walk to the bus stop to get to work every day, which is good for his health. Similarly, we have children who spend more time in front of a computer screen than playing outside like children should. Lut, what parent would let there kids play outside when there are tons of cars on the road? In Vauban, Germany, the streets are filled with bicycles and the chatter of wandering children because there are no cars to be afraid of. Limiting car usage can better the well-being of ourselves and everybody around us.

In conclusion, there are many advantages of limiting car usage in the world today. On every sidewalk, you would find relaxed and healthy people breathing clean and healthy air. We can create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" We will never achieve a perfect world, but it is not romantic or naive to work towards one.",0
1570,"As a student who has previously used online videos and readings as a way of education, I strongly believe that online and video education is beneficial to many students. You never know what kind of struggles a student is going through, and if we can make the school environment more comfortable for them, that is vital.

For example, we don't want a student with a phobia of school to miss out on an education; therefore, the school system must provide a way for the said student to get things done. Without online classes, the student would have to come into school to get paper work, and that may be a trigger for them.

Lot only does video education support kids with illnesses and other personal problems, it is more efficient than in school teaching. Work gets uploaded faster and easier, and questions are answered more quickly. Students can work at their own pace, and in many instances they fly ahead of their peers because they are not being dragged behind by other students who may not be on the same level as them.

We can even mention the event of a widespread illness taking over if a school were to shut down, what would they do without online education systems like Google Classroom? That is one of the few ways to keep our students update and educated during trying times. Students may be quarantined inside their homes, but that doesn't mean they cannot get any work done, all thanks to online schooling! Teachers would easily be able to send out assignments every day to keep the class on track.

Even students who attend public schools use online videos and readings every day. Teachers would not be able to do their job without the use of electronic education, and students wouldn't be able to learn. The age of technology is upon us, it's no surprise that the internet has become such a huge part of the school system.

Online school is an equitable solution to the many obstacles students may face during their years in school. How would the education system be viewed if they didn't take into account students who physically or mentally cannot participate in public schooling? I don't think they'd be considered a very open minded operation.

In conclusion, every student deserves an education, no matter how and when they get it. Whether it be at a desk and in a class, or at home in bed, every education is worth it, and every student is worthy of a formal education.  ",0

1572,"Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME. I agree on policy two, that there should be no cell phones allowed in school.

I think that if we would choose policy one, students wouldn't obey the policy. Even though Students would enjoy using their cell phones at lunch and other free-times, they would most likely sneak their phones and text during a lesson in class. Also, if the school allowed cell phones, students might forget to turn their phone off, and it would ring. The ringing cell phone would be a distraction to other students, disabling learning. I don't think students need to be using their cell phones at lunch and other free time because most of their friends that they would text or call would be in the same room.

If we chose policy two, there wouldn't be any distractions because there wouldn't be any cell phones at all.

What is more important? Having students not be able to use their cell phones during free time, or students not being able to learn because of cell phone distractions? Students not being able to learn is more important, and that is why I choose policy two, to have no cell phones in school at all.

Sincerely,

1573,"Many may argue that 'driverless' cars will be a great fundamental change in the world. Driverless cars are only helpful if for really know how to RSE them properly. They are very dangerous when it comes to being on the road around a branch of other people. Driving is already dangerous enough for young people with Orr phones, so why make it worse on rs? I believe that driverless cars will only make Orr world worse in every situation.

If for don't know how to RSE these 'driverless' cars there is really no point in owning one. Since 2009 people have been hoping to eventually have a car that drives itself BRT i don't think they actually looked at the logic behind it. This driverless car means there is really no learning taking place. Why even have a license if for won't ever need it because your car drives itself? It is practically a waste of time.

Another reason I world not approve of this evolving is because, just imagine all the things that could happen if yo rare in a driverless car around a branch of people on the highway. For could easily be going a certain speed limit and then have to speed RP to a different speed and if for cant do that fast enough there is most likely going to be a crash. Does anybody see that driving and maintaining a certain type of composure in a car is hard enough?

Keeping your composure in a driverless car world practically be impossible. For can be way too relaxed in a driverless car and completely forget to pay attention to your surroundings, which is also extremely dangerous.

The last reason these cars should not be abolished is because we all know how teenagers can't wait to get on the road. We also know how much rs teens love Orr Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, etc. This driverless car only promotes rs to do these things while we're driving because of the simple fact that we don't have anything better to do. With this we can pay all the attention we want to Orr cellular devices and hope that nothing tragic will happen. Hoping isn't good enough. If we keep everything the same we will be sure that teenagers pay close attention to the road instead of the distractions in the car.

That being said there are many flaws to this car. If for don't know what yo rare doing, do not PRT yourself in that situation. Not paying attention to your surroundings is very dangerous and leads to for crashing. Lastly distractions are a big problem in the United States and this car will only make them worse. Therefore, I say no to the driveless cars. When it comes down to life or death I chose life. Safety always comes first.  ",0
1574,"Dear State Senator,

Have you ever noticed when you look at the votes, The popular votes are more accurate and used more than the Elector college votes?

When you gather all the popular votes, Usually one candidate has more popular votes,

But when it came time for the election, The candidate that had the most popular votes didn't win at all.

Like in 2000, When Gore had more popular votes than Bush, Yet fewer electoral votes,

But that was the first time since 1888.

(pf 2 lines 4 of In Defense of the Electoral college)

You have to think when the people vote, Their not the ones who are really making a choice in the electoral college.

It is the electors who elect the president, Not the people.

When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate if electors.

(pf 1 lines 3 In Defense of the Electoral college)

Yes some people are aware that the Electoral college was established by our founding fathers, but they also state the constitution etc. Can be changed as the country grows and changes.

With elector college Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.

(pf 5 lines 1 in what is the electoral college)

Meaning all the people in your state which is usually a lot, all those votes are only represented by a couple of electors from your state vs. that with all the people of your state with individual votes.

Sounds pretty ridicules.

Most states have a ""winnertakeall"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.

(pf 7 lines 1 in Was is the electoral college)

Which sometimes aren't the best idea.

Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.

This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency.

And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives?...

(pf 1 lines35 in why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong)

What's wrong with electoral college system is voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

Again the people sadly do not have a choice individually for whom they want.

A lot of times voters get confused in this and just give up voting all together.

Some people ask, an voters control whom their electors vote for?

Not always.

Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate?

Sometimes, Because they get really confused with how things are.

People have been arguing this situation for a long time now yet electoral college is still in place.

Who knows maybe you and the other senators might decided to try to go with the popular vote some say.

Thank you for your time.

1575,"Yes, today most the people have cellphones anything technological. But should we be able to operate cellphones while driving is the question everyone is concerned about. Everyone has different set OT ideas about it people should be allowed to use their phones while driving. There are lots OT advertising about phones and the cool things that they can do. And that you can test without having to stop looking at the road, but those are all False advertising because you do. You must unlock your phone Tor you to be able to say the text just because we don't have to type it doesn't mean that is don't take our sight out the road. Some say it's wrong Tor you to text and drive, and they are right it's wrong to do it because something can happen to us or more likely to someone else. It's easy Tor us to think that nothing can never happen to use it we text and drive at the same time, because it may have never happened to you, but it doesn't mean that it hasn't happened to anyone else. Drivers should be more careful about what they do when they are driving it should not be legal to text and drive. No one should have to lose a Family member Tor someone who was texting and driving and not being careful. Some want to get home to their Families and can see them again.

Everyone has their own opinion and that Tine, everyone has the rights. Texting and driving can cause your own lite and someone's else Tor examples A Father, mothers. Children's lite. Cellphones are really use Tull to use and always will be useful. Because they help use in our everyday lite to get to places talk to our Families that don't live close to use. It helps use be able to work and have good jobs, but it also hurts use not just that Tact that lots OT teens text when they drive but the Tact that they can't be without their phones to be able to get sate where ever they are going. In conclusion I think that it's wrong Tor anyone to text and drive you should play sate and just wait to answer a text message a call when you get to the place you need to be. Sate the Tact that something can happen to you and your Family will be upset and cry Tor you just because you couldn't wait to answer your phone.  ",0
1576,"Foremost, the electoral college is a process used for selecting a president through the popular vote of qualified representors. The electoral college was established by our founding lathers, and still benefits us today. Using trusted representatives and efficiently casting the desired vote, the electoral college is the best method of selecting a president. The electoral college allows the country to be sure of an outcome, and no one region can elect a president on its own.

Electoral votes are cast by electors chosen to represent each state, these electors are ""...trusted to vote for the party's nominee..."", stated Richard Poster. This means that electors are trusted and qualified to efficiently represent the vote their state desires. The trust set upon electors is ""rarely betrayed"" Poster said. The last time an election was won by someone who didn't get the popular vote was in 2000, and this doesn't happen often. This is contrary to what was said by Bradford Plume. Plume stated ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse.""

The electoral college gives America certainty of an outcome, without a tie, or a roll election. The ability to rest easy knowing there will be a clear winner is an ability given to America, by the system of electoral votes.  A tie occurrence in an election is ""Highly unlikely..."" Poster said. Even though most states use a ""Winner take all"" basis, ties and roll elections are still extremely rare and unlikely.

Swing states a debated and popular issue among the electoral college. Swing states are often paid more attention and given more information than regular states. While being paid more attention, the swing states together are able to determine the election's outcome. Though small states don't get much attention, they still have a say in the election.",0
1577,"I am going to be writing about a story called A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves. the things that I am going to put in here are reasons why Luke's convincing others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. Other Cowboys should join in the Seagoing Cowboy program because there are a lot of horses and other animals that they could help take care of. The next thing would be because they get to go on cattle-boat trips that are unbelievable oppurtunities for a small-town boy. The third reason would be because the Cowboys get to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. The last reason why others should join is because when Luke said that it was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger.

Now I am going to tell you details that support Luke's claims. At the beginning of the story it said that Luke had been working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. UNRRA ( The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas so Luke and Don signed up. In August 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived August 14, Luke says that the day the Pacific war ended. They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece-with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe And China. Luke says that the cattle-boat trips were unbelievable oppurtunities for a small-town boy. caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. Luke found time to have fun on board especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. It opened up the world for Luke Bomberger.

So what I wrote about in the story was about a story called A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves. The things that I put in the story were about reasons to join the program and to support Luke's claims. Like for the first one I put that they could like play baseball or volleyball on their free time. That they could get to take care of animals (lots of animals). Like in the second one I used ideas from the story for that paragraph. Thanks for reading hope you enjoyed.",0
1578,"Phones and Driving

Over time, we've seen the consequences of phones and driving manifest itself in the form of negative impacts upon the world. Phones have negatively affected our people in ways that we have experienced so much pain through the increase in casualty rate. Although phones have had its positive advantages, phone have also had its disadvantage. Over time the increase in technological devices has caused many distractions in more ways than science can explain. Moreno we see this change and distraction throughout out cars and times of travel. Because of the way we are so emotionally attached to our phones, we forget the importance of many situations at hand. Powever, drivers should not be able to operate their technological devices while in a vehicle.

When the discussion is brought upon among the awareness of phones and driving, people get mad. They get frustrated in a manner that they feel the authority, police, and the people are in fact"" doing too much"". The vision that the people don't see is the value of their lives and the correlation between that idea and cellphones in use while operating a vehicle. Studies and different statistics have shown the causes of death from the use of cell phones while driving. Within this modern society, different policies and ordinances have been put into place to show the importance of abstaining from the use of cellphones in the vehicles. Not only does use your cellphones in the car out your life in danger, but also the people surrounding you.

The authority and the government need to make this social issue more aware to the public. The use of cellphones in our vehicles should be prohibited. Too much death and pain has been caused by devices like our cell phones. It is imperative that we make the people more aware on this issue. If we don't take this matter seriously, we will continue to see the negative impact confide within our communities, nation, and world as a whole. There should be no more talking about the issue and whether it should be prohibited. The answer is at hand. Drivers should not be on their devices while operating a vehicle.  ",0
1579,"Students should not be aloud to graduate with the three-year program because the student my have a job, focus on their academics, be involved in a extracurricular activities after school. Students may have or need a job for many such ass, being able to sport there family, so they are not always going to be available after school to attend those classes required to graduate in 3 years. Students my also need to save up for a higher education if they plane on attending a 4-year university or even attending a community college. Students also need some time of work expires, so they need that job, so they are able to put on their resume that they have some form of work expires so if they decide that right after high school they want to just jump in into the work force they have some type of work expires. Another reason why students should not be allowed to do the 3-year program is because It's going to be stressful trying to put a 4-year education in 3 years. Some students take advance courses that are more changing, and give out more homework than regular classes. Some students are not going to be available after school because they may have to stay after school to retake important quizzes or test that are going to affect a big part of their grade. Y student may have to go home and work on big projects or homework so there ability to stay after school is going to be limited due to the fact that they have homework to do and other assignment. One other major reason is that the student with be involved in extracurricular activity such ass sports some sports can be year around sports so even is not there season they still have to condition and train for the upcoming season, so they are most likely going to have to stay after school hours to do those things. Another reason is that they might be involved in clubs, so they also have to stay after school and also have to do some type of volunteering in the community so that's going to take away time, so they may not be away available to attend to all the required classes to be able to graduate using the 3-year program. Another reason is that they might have tutoring either at home or in school, so they are able to get help on homework and other material that they need help with projects and stuff like that.

My conclusion is that no students should not be aloud to graduate early using the 3-year program, became is going to add on to things that the students already have going on in their lives so I believe student should just graduate with there class and take there time and graduate high school in 4 years.",0
1580,"Should people be allowed on their phone while driving?

I think they shouldn't because that causes a lot of wrecks and other bad things. 26% of car wrecks are caused by the driver being on their phone and not paying attention. When you're driving and on your phone at the same time you're risking other people lives and yours too. There should be a new law that says there should not be any electronics placed in a moving vehicle. Plenty of people been killed in an accident because some careless human being decides to drive and text and take their eyes off the road.

Another thing if you're going to have your phone in your car turn it on do not disturb or silent so when you receive a phone call or text you will not be distracted. If you get caught by the police texting while driving there should be a huge fine to make people learn their lessons. Texting while driving is basically like drunk driving either way there's an accident that's about to happen, but it can never lead up to that point if you just put the phone down.

All it takes is just one little glance at your phone then room!! An accident you just created. Just do everyone a favor and put the phone on hold. There's been a lot of innocent people dying because someone wants to be irresponsible and text while driving.  ",0
1581,"At first the Electoral College is a process of compromising between election of the president by a vote in Congress and by popular votes from citizens. To my opinion I could favor this as a smart compromise.

Second it Does to show that when a president Bets elected and wins by popular vote by only citizens is not a Good idea. Reason is that people only vote for a certain president based on not their support or ideas for America, but based on their looks. When the Electoral College comes into play, Citizens vote for a slate to pledge a candidate. Then it depends on the state.

Finally, when the electors who elected the president and not the people, the citizens votes Does into a Good cause. When they agree to a final vote then that candidate Bets the job.

In conclusion, I think the Electoral College is a Good idea because when an idea strikes from a candidate, and approved by Congress. Then everybody wins the vote.  ",0
1582,"UGH! ""I can't focus at school anymore now that grandma is gone. Nothing feels the same anymore. I just wish I could work on my own time!"" Said Generic_Name. Generic_Name, we will do something about this, I'm always here to help, said her father Generic_Name. Some schools offer distance learning as a way to attend classes from home by a way of online or video conferencing. Do students benefit from being able to attend classes at home? I completely agree with this statement because it definitely can make an extraordinary change in one's students life for the better. Students would benefit from this massively since less pressure would be applied on them and weight would get lifted off their shoulders. Students would have their own time to work and can take various different approaches in this situation.

One of the many reasons why students would benefit at home is because they have better work ethic. Everyone works better at home rather than school because less pressure is on oneself to do amazing by strict teachers and bossy students. My close friend Generic_Name, was once offered to take some of her college classes online rather than getting up at 8am, stressing herself out early in the morning, but at home she took a couple classes at noon, and she gave in her best attempts than she had ever given at her early morning DP bio course. Another time, my brother Generic_Name, had been tutoring one of his classmates Generic_Name online. Now before they had been working at the local library and Generic_Name barely understood anything because of the noises and hyper teenage there, Now from the comfort of their own homes, they video called each other and Generic_Name started to go from 50s to 90s in just a week since he had a much better work ethic at home instead of in public with everyone around! Students do put in their best attempts and have a better work ethic at home freely rather than cramming themselves at school.

Next, a students mental health plays a very huge role in this topic. My loving sister, Generic_Name, had been diagnosed with severe depression and social anxiety. She could barely force herself to wake up at 6 in the morning for school every day since it was very dreadful for her. Now when she switched from public school to online school, she was so much happier. I watched her eyes fill with joy and saw a bright light like I've never seen in my own sister in just a couple of weeks into online classes. She finally got to be herself again without all the judgmental students at school telling her horrific things every day and peer pressuring her to the max, she was finally happy and was back to getting all D's in no time. Another time, my cousin Generic_Name was so worn out from the stress from school and college apps, he had decided to take online classes for college in order to work on bettering himself as a person for his own health. Online classes brought Generic_Name outside the dark dungeon he was sitting in and changed his life for the better. Students would definitely benefit from taking online classes not only their grades, but as well as themselves, as a person.

Third, another way students benefit by taking classes from the benefit of their own home, is because they get to spend more time with their loved ones. Now while in school, we leave early in the morning without getting to see our parents and with sports, clubs and extracurricular activities, by the time one gets home it is already very late and one misses out on seeing they're parents since they are very busy with work as well. Now one of my good friends Generic_Name, lived with her grandma but was very busy with school and basketball practice and by the time she got home she was asleep, this continued on for 4 years, and once the time came, her grandma had unfortunately passed away. ""WOW"" If I wasn't always so busy with school and would've taken online classes, I would have much more time to spend with her. Now some may argue and disagree that students would not benefit from taking online classes due to most teens and adults are lazy and would never complete their work or assignments, but that statement is false because the ones who want to strive for the best and make better situations for themselves know how to manage their time properly and set goals for themselves in the future. There would be a drastic impact on students grades if they took online classes and would benefit in many ways.

In conclusion, there would be many positive results of distance learning. Now many may have heard of J. K Rowling, one of the best writers of the generation, she took many writing classes online which helped shape who she is today. She is known for being one of the best novelists today, and she did not have time to go to early morning classes, but instead she chased her dream of becoming a writer and had not gone UN noticed. Therefore, we can fix this issue by offering a variety of classes online for future students instead of forcing them at an unreasonable time and by letting students have a voice of their own to speak out. Students would see a great impact just by being able to attend classes from their own homes!  ",0
1583,"Phones and Driving

Americans have fallen in love with cell phones. They love the easy access of talking with loved ones, the taking of selfies at any time and the excitement of scrolling through and interacting with friends on social media. Cell phones have really made life for the American people a joyous and exciting occasion; until they get behind the wheel of a car. Loss of life, driving privileges taken away, and getting a ticket are all common problems that cell phones use when driving present.

Causing an accident and killing yourself or another person is a very real situation you can face when using the cell phone and driving. There is nothing wrong with talking all day and night to family and friends on the cell phone. The problems come when you decide to take the phone conversation into the vehicle while driving. One of the problems is distracted driving and taking your eyes off the road. Taking your eyes off the road is dangerous because in a split second you can have an accident and kill yourself or another person.

If you get into a serious accident, you may lose your privilege to drive your vehicle. The common behavior of texting and driving is similar to a person that has been drinking and decides to drive a vehicle. This behavior is dangerous, reckless, and an accident waiting to happen. Your eyes are supposed to be focused and alert on the road; not in your phone. If you receive multiple tickets for driving while using your phone, there is a chance that your driving privileges could be taken away. To get back the privileges to drive again could cost a lot of money and time. Being able to drive is a privilege and losing that privilege is not worth losing due to a social media status update.

In the state of Georgia you are not allowed to text and drive, if you are caught texting while driving you will receive a ticket. People who text and drive are putting their lives and other people's lives at risk. In order to prevent the 1 out of 4 car accidents in the United States from texting and driving, there must be more laws put in place. We must continue pushing the hands-free law to save more lives and help keep the roads safe.

As of today, getting a ticket, risking the loss of driving privileges, and even taking a chance of causing a death has not stopped drivers from using their phones while driving. It is exciting to take the perfect selfie and update your social media status on the go, however those are some of the things that should not be done while driving. Distractions from using cell phones while driving have become very dangerous and caused our roads to be unsafe. In order to drive you must follow the driving rules and understand that tragic events can be caused by using cell phones and driving at the same time. So for the reasons I explained in this paper, I don't think individuals should be allowed to drive and use a cell phone in any state in America.  ",0
1584,"While technology is being developed as time goes by, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", is when technology wasn't good and for that, no one couldn't tell what she's feeling before has (facial action coding system) revealed her hidden feelings. Having a technology that can read expressions is valuable and should be allowed. There aren't many affects to it, and it would help many people to express or show at least a sign or a feeling.

Before feelings were being revealed and shown by a machine, people we're already talented and smart enough to tell one another faces. In the article, the author told us that it's not hard to tell when someone is either sad or happy, ""for instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" this quote provides us information that looking at someone's face can give us a lot of hints, even if they try to avoid it or show it. Which means it is natural for someone to know notice it while some can't. Another thing that the author tells us is that the muscles are visible and that there's nothing to hid when parts of our faces gives the viewer an opportunity to either guess or say what they see,"" To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" this quote perfectly explains that there are many majors and units where it deals with the muscles and movement in our bodies. It's easy to tell with or without parts of the face showing.

Lastly, the machine. As technology increases, a machine called racial Action Coding System, solved it better than using our proper eyes. Dr. Paul Beckman, who combined his thoughts to create the machine, and Dr. Huang, who helped Dr. Paul Beckman build the machine, helped themselves and others to know the hidden feelings of Mona Lisa and sooner will be used on others. In the article, it talks about how The Vinci made Mona Lisa look different while he was drawing/painting her,"" Yet Dr. Huang observes that the artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" this quote means that Da Vinci was smart enough to switch up on the painting and made it seem so realistic and looked like she's going through a lot.

While the readers receive a lot of information about the technology and how it works, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", was more of a for than against. There's nothing wrong using it while its helping scientist know what's going on inside a person's mind. Not enough of against doesn't mean this article is not helpful, it can still be helpful and especially for those who are for it. Technology is helpful and valuable to many subjects or topics.  ",0
1585,"Texting and Driving

I believe that you shouldn't be able to text while driving because you are putting yourself and others at danger because you are no longer aware of your surroundings and can steer anywhere while you aren't paying attention. I understand that there are some things that need attention, but it's not worth the gives of innocent people. Nearby about 400,000 people die from texting and driving. 1 out of 4 car accidents occur from texting and driving and that's true a shame. The average text sent takes the drivers eyes off the road for about 5 seconds and that's enough time to get into an are threatening accident according to Safe Wise. Com. These deaths hurt people mentally and physically and usually cause depression due to the fact that they EOST an moved one to a foolish person. Some people don't even pay attention to the rues put in to peace by the law and are seen Constanța on the phone with someone.

These people deserve to get their license suspended and maybe even revoked because these people have no empathy for people who actually want to make it to their destination safety. The phone cases and text messages can wait because they aren't worth someone's are, and it sure isn't worth going to jail for. Just wait untie you reach your destination to do these things. Keep this nonsense of the roads. The roads were meant for you to drive on not to text on. I think we should have some type of scanner to see if there are any active phones in use and if there are place or some type of authority should be alerted. This should bring down the amount of deaths caused by texting and driving. This is also another way to prevent texting while driving.  ",0
1586,"""Thy future belongs to those who believe in thy beauty of their dreams."" Eleanor Roosevelt.

Students who ARY a part of sport teams, student councils, art clubs, Etc ARY more likely to find something they ARY passionate about and will have something to look forward to Each day.

Organization, collaboration, and responsibility ARY just some of thy skills students gain while participating in Extracurricular activities. People always have to work together; therefore, it's better to learn how to collaborate well with others sooner than later. For Example, if a student joins an after school soccer team they must learn how to collaborate with their teammates, Even if they don't like them. This will benefit them later in life when they get paired up with someone they dislike and have to complete a project they will already know how to work through it.

Another important skill is organization, which is helpful, because student's will by ably to take good notes, primary neat projects, and colleges like it when student's applications ARY wYllthoughtout and organized.

Another reason finding a hobby is beneficial is that finding friends at school can buy very difficult since students might not have anything similar.

1588,"Have you ever heard of a software that tracks your movements to tell you your emotion? This software is able to detect percentages of emotions on your face, all you have do is look in a camera. But, should this be used on student computers? I think that this software should not be used on students computers because of distractions, the speed of the computers, and the anxiety of somebody always watching you. I can see the argument for this software going both ways, but I would not want a camera watching me all day.

This software can be very distracting. Say a student is getting bored with the lesson being taught in class that day. They might decide to play around with facial expressions to see how their laptop with this always watching software reacts. This can cause the student not to hear the lesson being taught, or make it easier by tricking the software. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" it tells some facial expressions you can make to get this software to react.

Have you ever dealt with a slow computer due to something not running properly? With this software on school laptops, they will be so slow that nothing at all will work. As a result of this speed issue, students will fall behind in class, and at home. This software is much too massive for a school laptop. To run this you would need a state-of-the-art computer costing you thousands of dollars. ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" Schools can't effort to give every student a computer capable of running this software.

Anxiety. It is a growing problem in the United States today. Anxiety of people judging you, stress from work, or must nervousness. This facial recognition software on school computers would bring anxiety to a whole new level. The thought that someone is always watching you is not a good thought. This program will not only feel like you are constantly being watched, but in a way will be true. The software always tracks you facial expressions, your emotions, to adapt to how you ""feel"". Also, imagine how easy it would be to hack into this intricate software. It would be fairly simple to someone with experience. If someone were to hack into the camera, they could constantly watch you. As long as your computer is opened up, they are watching you.

Did you change your opinion on this software? It is terrifying to know that someone could be watching at any time they choose. This software is wrong for school computers because of the speed of the computers, the anxiety of someone watching, and the distractions. I hope you consider voting no for this software in the future.  ",0

1591,"I disagree with the principal because most people can not do extracurricular activities, because they do not like the activities that are given to them, or they do not like working with others, or they are overweight and can not do any sort of exercise most overweight people can barely run, or walk without breathing hard/ heavy but to be clear I am over weight but I can walk a decent distance without breathing heavy I can run for like 5 or 8 laps to be honest but back to the prompt, then there are people that are skinny but do not want to do anything, and they do not like socializing with anybody they only want to be alone that's kind of what I do but I socialize from sometimes, but we should not have to do extracurricular activities because the principle wants us to it should always be our decision and only ours and the principal should just respect that.

In my personal opinion we should always have a choice on what to do like if we want a tattoo or if we want to quit school the decision should always be up to us no matter what anybody says it is our life we shape our own path to destiny, and we may need the help of others on the way and that is just fine okay because everybody needs help in life even I do with something's like I need help with my math, and I need help with my science because math and science confuse me now because math involves letters now and science i never really got, but most people get everything about these 2 subjects but not me, and that is why I ask for help because we all need it like some people need help with sleeping or getting up, it is an odd process to me but to be honest, but we need to have our own choices and our own say in the matter that everyone should hear and then voice their opinion, that is what we need to do now we could put it up to a vote, but I'm absolutely certain that everyone will vote no to being forced to do extracurricular activities because, nobody wants to and if the principal does not agree they can suck it up because they got outvoted and that means the people have spoken that is what the majority of the students have voted on because, it is their right to make their own decisions and do what they want to do and everyone should respect that in my opinion and if they do not then say I do not care it is my opinion not yours and that's that, and they can not say no to everybody's opinion, they might say it to 5 or 10 people but not all the people and that's the beauty of the world because this is how the voting system works, and it is a great system that we should not change it at all it has gotten us a lot of good presidents and a lot of great senators but the voting system got us my favorite president john f Kennedy, he was one of the best presidents for like 2 years then he got assassinated that was a pretty sad day I felt bad for his wife, but still the voting system is almost flawless, so we should keep improving it and not get rid of it because I think getting rid of it a long time ago would have been crazy, and we would have not ended up with the type of system we are stuck with today.",0
1592,"In the year 1976, when Viking 1 spacecraft was taking photographs of possible landing spots for Viking 2 spacecraft, they found a formation in a rock that looked like a human face. The shadows made the rock look like it had a nose, mouth, and two eyes, like a human. This was found in a region of the Red Planet called Colonia. The ""Head"" was nearly two miles from end to end, and it seemed to be starring back at the cameras.

The controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab were probably quite surprised when this face popped up on their screens, looking them right in the eyes. This sensation was short-lived. Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, which was common around Colonia. The only difference with this one is it had unusual shadows that made it seem like an Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later pass unveiled the image for the public eye to see. The caption on this picture was ""Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head.... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and a mouth."" pass'S reasoning was that the picture would help engage public attraction to Mars.

This public picture was soon a pop icon. It starred in Hollywood films, was in books, magazines, talk shows on the radio, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for over 25 years. Some people think that this picture is evidence of life on Mars. Conspiracy theorist say that this is information pass would rather hide. Defenders of the pass budget wish that there was life on Mars, as this would make pass more popular, and even richer, when people use the picture in books, movies, magazines, and more.

Although most scientist believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Colonia became a priority to pass, when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. Jim Gavin, chief scientist, said that they felt like it was a right of taxpayers to see photographs of the face as soon as possible. On April 5, 1998, Michael Main snapped a photograph ten times sharper then the old one. This became popular with web surfers, as they were waiting for the first photo to show up on a JPL website. Only this picture showed what they were not wanting, a natural landform. This was not an alien monument after all.

While most people were satisfied, others were not. They still think that pass is still hiding evidence of an alien monument. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. The camera on board MGS had to peer though wispy clouds to see it. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden behind clouds on purpose, so that humans would not be able to see them. Mission controls planned to take another photograph of it. It is not easy work, and it is not easy to target Colonia. They just do not pass the face very often.

Pevertheless, on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Colonia, MGS drew close enough for a second law. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view.

They used the cameras the highest resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans at 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Vikings photo."" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were objects on the ground such as airplanes or Egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could have seen what they were"" Said Jim Gavin.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms that are common around the American West. ""It reminds me of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" Says Gavin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height of the Face on Mars."" He added. So weather or not thence is an alien landform or a rock formation, pass does wish it was an alien landform, just to bring pupillary to the Red Planet. However, it is highly impossible for it to be an alien monument, as they would have to have oxygen to survive, and they would have to find plenty of food and water to also survive.",0
1593,"Letting public school students take online classes could impact better for them in the long run. Students would not have ant sort of distraction from other students. After finishing the online class for the DAT students would have more time to do what the need to do at home or at work, There is a possibility that students could struggle BT not getting face to face help from a teacher. Students could benefit from attending online classes because the would not have ant distraction from others around them and afterwards would have more time to focus on things at home; however, it could get hard BT not getting the help the want from an actual computer during ant time of the DAT.

First, students would focus more on their selves with no one around to bother them. At public schools students would make many friends, which is not a bad thing, but would be too distracted to do what the need to get done. For example, students with mental issues and ant sort of problems could take online classes rather than dealing with kids at school who could cause them not to do their work. Sometimes kids do not like having so many other students around them and decide the think it would be better to stat at home and take their classes where the find it more comfortable the most. Some students mat like the idea of stating home and doing online classes and others mat feel the total opposite and want to go out, but the should know it would have a better outcome for their selves.

Secondly, after students take their classes online the would have more time than the would go to a public school. When finishing the classes the students can do whatever the needed to at home, or if the have work. For example, some students mat have a really good dating job and would rather focus more on that than going to a public school that would take up most of their DAT. Some students might have to do chores at home, or have to help with family Evert DAT. Students should have more time out of their DAT to do things that the enjoy to do and what the need to do rather than spending more than half of their DAT sitting in a classroom.

On the other hand, there are students who need more of a face to face help than only getting the contact the need from a person through a device. The student and teacher and or computer, mat only have a limited time to receive help. For example, teachers who have kids at home would have to limit their time with a student so the can take care of their own kids. Students mat not get all the information that the need BT stating onliner than BT getting it in person. Sometimes students would not want to have to stat at home while not enjoying taking online classes and would prefer to stat in school and get the help and information the need.

Finally, students should take online classes even if the do not think it would help them. Stating at school can cause them to stat distracted BT their friends and everyone around them. Students would enjoy the extra time at home to do what the need. When not able to get the face to face help during anytime of the DAT could be a struggle that the would have to pass. Students would be able to benefit from online classes because the would not have ant distraction from others and afterwards students would have more time to focus on the things the need to do at home or at work; however, it could become hard BT not getting face to face help during anytime of the DAT.",0
1594,"So when you are making a decision you always ask other people advice and what they think. If you ask more people then you can see their opinions and have a better idea on what to do. When you ask many people for their opinions you compare it with yours and get a better and more precise answer. Like, if you are getting a shoe, then you ask other people on their opinions on what you should get. When you ask many people you have many options on what to get. You can look at their opinions and see what's the perfect shoe and get it based on opinions and advice. You should always listen to yourself and what you like but asking other people can held you think on what your decision and opinion.

When your asking other peoples opinions, your looking at what most people said. If most people had the same answer its probably a good choice and has reasoning behind it. The more people you ask for their opinions and more options you'll get. That means the more of a specific and better answer. The more people you ask the more it improves your decision. You also feel better on your decision if you ask more people, then you can feel like your doing the right thing. Let's say if you're buying a hoodie, and you want to know if the hoodie looks good. You ask other people about it, and if most people say that it looks good you feel good about your purchase.

If you want someone's advice, and you only ask one person, that's won't be as much as good advice if you asked many people. If you want to know what song you should listen to, and you ask one person, and they tell you something way different from yours, and which you don't like. It wouldn't be a good option for you. If you ask 10 people, and they give you a lot of variety you can have options. It better because if you ask one person you have no variety, but if you ask more people you have variety and options.

It's just better to ask multiple people for their opinions then one person. If you only ask one person, you might get a biased answer. If you ask multiple people, maybe a few are biased, but you've still got a few others who won't have a biased answer. When you're doing an experiment you do many trials because one might mess up, and if you do a few trials one will succeed and will have a precise answer. It's the same thing with this that you need more than one opinion and that if you want a precise answer.

In conclusion, I think that if you were to ask someone advice, then you should ask multiple people for their opinions to make a better choice. It has helps your decision and gives you options and leads to a more precise answer. It is better than only asking one person then many people.",0
1595,"Iiscussion among my classmates and teachers regarding online learning has been circulating throughout my school. Many of my peers and teachers have opposing views on the matter. Some students say that it would be easier, and that it would be amazing if we didn't have to be stuck in a classroom all day and sit through a lecture. While, my teachers state it would be much more challenging to teach the material, and for students to obtain it. I do not think that online learning would be beneficial towards students because it diminishes students' creativity, is not realistic in everyday life, and would be unsuccessful due to teenagers lack of motivation.

Creativity should play a key role in a students' growth throughout their education. Without being in the classroom, ways to express one's creativity would be limited. Projects, presentations and intellectual conversations would be removed from the learning realm, and would be replaced with watching videos and staring at a computer all day. Technology has been proven to be unhealthy to adults and especially teenagers. It has rotted our brains, shortened our attention span, and removed our creativity. Our generation has been revolved around technology, and has set the stage for the future. It is no doubt that one day their will come a time when students no longer come to school to talk to their peers and learn from their teachers, but instead learn from robots, in their dark rooms, only lightened by their computer screens and cell phones. Coming to school and sitting in a classroom, where are phones zipped in our backpacks and our laptops shut, is refreshing and healthy for teenagers. With online classroom, students would not be able to take physical education and run in the fresh air, and have a break from the technology they stare at throughout the day. If we were to take online classes from home we would be constantly hovered over our computer screens, diminishing our creativity and forgetting what school used to mean.

Online school is not realistic and does not help teenagers prepare for the real world. With online school there would be few, if not any, interaction between peers or with adults. Teenagers today can barely talk to an adult without looking at their feet and avoiding eye contact, due to the lessening of interaction in the classrooms. Online learning would only increase the problem. Most jobs across the country and throughout the rest of the world all have a form of interaction whether it is presenting a presentation, discussion in meetings, business calls, marketing, and much more. Students would be ill prepared to step into the real world and be successful in their next step of life. Life is not seen through a computer screen and nor should it ever. While technology can be practical at times, it should not be what students rely on for their education.

Teenagers lack of motivation would lead to the unproductive reality of online school. Most teenagers do not have the discipline, or attention span to take time out of their day, every day, to sit down at home for hours on end and learn online. Most teenagers need discipline in the classroom. When in school, if students get off track there is a teacher there to help them focus and be productive. When sitting in a desk at school, teenagers are much more productive than if they were to lay in bed at home watching videos. If one were to take online classes at home they would no longer face the discipline teachers show them every day in school when saying, ""put your phone away!"" or ""stop talking!"" or ""wake up!"". Without teachers to help guide them in the classroom, majority of students would be on their phones, sleep, or be with their friends all day.

Overall, online learning would be ill fitting for my generation and others to come because it destroys creativity, does not help one in the real world, and would be difficult for teenagers due to their lack of motivation. While, some may see it as a new and improved way for students to learn, be independent, and serve as a convenience; the negatives out way the positives in too many ways, especially the health of adolescent teenagers.",0
1596,"World War II was the start of development centering cars bot; in recent years the popularity as well as the traffic has gone down because of limiting car Osage which have lots of advantages. Limiting the One of cars advantages are less air pollution and new communities

Initially, less car Osage means less carbon emissions which leads to less air pollution. For example, Elisabeth Rosenthal author of"" The End of Car COlt Ore"" wrote ""If the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions..."". Limiting the One of cars will have a huge benefit on the environment by stopping more emissions from damaging the Ozone layer. For example in Bogotá, Colombia they have a day called ""Day Without Cars"" and Carlos Arturo Plaza a businessman who livest her says ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" from ""Carefree day is spinning into big hit in Bogotá"" written by Andrew Silky. People living there have seen the benefits of the limits on cars and thinks it's a perfect thing for their city and not even rain can stop people from participating says Bogotá Mayor Antennas Mocks.

Additionally, these limitations have created new communities by building places that are very easy to get to. For example, Elisabeth Rosenthal author of ""In Germany Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" wrote ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walkaway on a main street, Rather than in malls along some distant highway."" With the new approach of limiting car Osage things are built closer making many things accessible to everyone. For example, Andrew Silky the author of ""Carefree day is spinning into big hit in Bogotá"" wrote ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city Uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by smooth sidewalks; rosewood restrictions dramatically cot traffic; and new restraints and Upscale shopping districts have cropped Op."". With the changes of accessibility bossiness owners have to come where the money is making everything more accessible and creating new things in the area. Building things closer attracts more people which means more homes being built and more families enjoying the community.

Clearly, the advantages of limiting car Osage is amazing because it means less air pollution and new communities. Limitations on car Osage will benefit Os and the world.  ",0
1597,"Does the Electoral College work? Are you happy with a group of electors choosing your president? I write this letter to you, our state senator, because, like many other U.S. citizens or residents, I have my own opinion. I am in favor of the idea of changing to popular vote. Electoral College does not work, it is unfair to voters because a president with the highest popular vote could not win, and it could be ""disaster factor"". Many are familiar with this term: ""compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens""(What Is the Electoral College?,1), but how does it benefit us? Does it express our opinions and preferences?

Let's go back in time to the election of 2000, The candidate with the most popular votes was Gore, therefore, everyone was expecting him to win. The majority was happy with the outcome until they counted the electoral votes, Bush had more electors on his side than Gore. Nobody understood why, they gave the country the president less wanted. Despite the fact that it was the first time since 1888, (because it happened once and for sure it could happen again), Why did all those people voted if they got the president they didn't trust to rule their country? In History class, my teacher told us: ""This country's foundation is for the people to rule the government, in other places (like Italia, Argentina, Spain, etc.) the government takes care of the people, like it, they were our parents."" I believe we stay true to the foundations and let the people choose the president they want.

""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system alloys for much worse""(Plume,1). This quote is based on 1960,when people who favored separation based on race nearly Democratic electors were replaced with the ones who would oppose Kennedy. Many electors make a last minute change in their decision, and they decide to go over to the other side and vote against that original choice, the party's candidate. ""When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors""(Poster,1).

Another reason why this system should be abolished is the winnertakeall system. The candidates do not spend time in the states in which they believe they have no chance of winning. States had not even seen the candidate and in some cases, they even haven't seen a poster. For example, Plume says in a expert from ""Mother Jones"" that ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and Both California, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a dingle campaign add."" The Electoral College system is unfair to the voters.

Overall, My beliefs (and the beliefs of hundreds) is that the electoral college is unfair for the voters because it can be the cause of some major disaster, and it can choose the candidate the public is not Harry with. The votes are people who want to express, or show, political preferences, people who are determines to change their country for good, so give them the right to do it. ""It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!"" (Plume,1).  ",0
1598,"This article is mainly shown to inform readers just how useful exploring Venus can be. The author is quite enthusiastic about this topic and is eager to offer his/her insight on the subject. The author believes that getting a chance to explore Venus is a great benefit, because previous studies have led to scientists speculating that Venus was probably at one point in time just like Earth. Meaning that it probably was suitable for life or once had life, however it is unlike;y that it has any forms of life now.

Venus has too harsh of conditions to be able to support anything. High atmoshperic pressure, High concentration of sulfuric acid in the air, Intense heat all of these factors go into reasoning as to why it is not a good idea to go there unprepared especially when NASA is still working on ways to do so, or maybe they have ( I don't know i haven,t been updated on a topic) anyway even though it is proven to be dangerous it is not impossible. Landing on Venus and gathering data would be an outstanding accomplishment.

1601,"A Face To Remember

A distinctly human face, nearly two miles in length, stretches across an arid, barren landscape. This came to bu known as ""Thu face on Mars. It is a highly debated topic, being that some believe it was made by intelligent lifeforms, and others believe it to bu a naturally formed landform. Thu latter is, beyond Thu shadow of a doubt, correct, Thu reasons range from picture Evidence, to Thu SAMU landforms forming on Earth, to Thu fact that it would help NASA's budget immensely if life guru to bu discovered on other plants.

To begin with, concrete photos have burn released to Thu public that clearly show that Thu ""face"" is merely shadows cast onto a natural landform. Since Thu beginning of its discovery in 1976, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian must, common Enough around Colonia, only this ONU had shadows that made it looks like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" Guess what? They guru right, because in 2001, Mars Global Surveyor brought back a photo of Thu must that was in Thu ""...absolute maximum resolution,"" and it perfectly showed Thu must for what it was; a naturally formed chunk of land.

Another thing distinct about this landform is that WU have similar, provUntobU natural landforms on Earth. To quote Gavin, ""It reminds mu most of Middle Butte in Thu Snake River Plain of Idaho."" This means it is an undeniable truth that thus kind of things can form naturally. Of course because something can, usually means that it will, so, without denial, this landform is proven to bu real, and able to form.

Thu final fact of Thu matter is that NASA would gut an Enormous amount of funding if they could prove thru to bu life among Thu stars. So Thu truth is, ""...defenders of Thu NASA budget wish thru was an ancient civilization on Mars."" This discovery would lead to a piqued interest in space, and a need to conduct further research, meaning people would begin to give more donations to this new, interesting cause. In Thu UND NASA would benefit, and Thu point is proven wrong.

Over all, conspiracy theorist seemingly wish to stir Thu masses, and make distrust flourish, but most times their theories ARU Easily disproven. Thu theory of Thu face on Mars was simply, and very wrong.

Typically, whenever ANP wherever, everyone is engaged in some form of technology, cell phones in particular. From pagers, to car phones, to initial ""flip phones"", ANP now to smartphones, people practically use up most of their daily time with these devices. Nowadays, a lot of people poesy't even like to have phone conversations...they can deliver their entire thought through a simple text message. In some retrospect, that's a very goop thing; in others, it can be extremely crucial, especially when it comes to texting ANP driving. Texting ANP driving has been the leaping cause of car accidents in recent years

It can extremely dangerous to text ANP drive on the road it put people in danger they are more focus on the insolent paying accident to the road increases the chance that the drive can lose the control of the Venice ANP could cause a crash or even incident the worst case could kill other people is text ANP drive. Texting while driving has become the number one driving distraction for many people. Drivers keep to be aware of the dangers ANP keep their attention on the road, not on their cell phones or other mobile devices

These advertisements are harp to watch. No river wants to think about being responsible for a traffic accident that takes his or her own life or the lives of other motorists or pedestrians. Nevertheless, most rivers still use their cell phones while operating their vehicle. While taking a phone call is dangerous enough, the advent of text messaging made cell phones even more incompatible with driving a car. Reaping or sending a text or email takes both eyes off of the road, your mind off the task of driving, ANP sometimes both hands off the wheel

It can be dangerous to text ANP drive ANP in the united state have around one out ten people are killed other people off the earth from text ANP driving Because it's an issue of attentional there is only minimal extra distraction when picking up or helping a phone it poesy't really help to use a hands-free device. Merely thinking about something other than the road is enough to strain attention ANP increase your risk of a crash.

You should not text on your cell phone while driving because being distracted by texting is similar to driving while intoxicated. Texting on the phone while driving can cause you to react more slowly when an unexpected driving hazard emerges or perhaps to never see the hazard until it's too late for the other people in the car to not get hunt other on the road the have a rep light to having crash car ANP to texting ANP drive.

1604,"A future with driverless CARF can have many mixed feeling. Driverless CARF could help Solve many iffier, but in the Fame way cause just AF many problem. Many companies have been working on driverless CARF now for year, but none have a definite answer to a car without any help and operational need by human. Not having a fully driverless car already can represent the Struggle, and challenge of creating a driverless car in this era. So I believe that the creation of a driverless car if a waste. They can be dangerous on the Street, cost lot of money, and have no real need in this day and age.

Driverless CARF have already been proven to be dangerous on the Street. Companies have not yet come up with the technology for a car that can Felfdrive; the Felfdriving CARF need a person on the wheel for emergencies. Also, there CARF can brake, Steer and move on their own but need the affiance of a human when challenge come in the way. They need Special help, and require the driver who is already at the wheel to take over and navigate through work zone and accident. Having a ""driverless car"" but with a driver in the driver'F Feat, with HIF hand already on the wheel, but not driving make Fit redundant. Why waste that effort if a driver is already in the current position to drive.

If companies are putting all this effort into driverless CARF, why can't they put the Fame effort and money into a real world issue? A nice, new car can cost a lot of money, and at a low can run up to 25,000 dollar. So a nice, new car that would drive itself would run up to even much more money than that. We already have nice CARF that we can drive ourselves around in, and with no problem at all. We Shouldn be focused on making CARF that would make of American even lazier by not having to drive them. Companies Should instead put this money to helping find the cure for cancer, or fighting against poverty and homeleFFneFF in America or other countries. Better things could be done with this money, instead of trying to make American even lazier.

A car that can drive itself had no real need in today age, people drive themselves fine everyday around the world without a problem. Some might Fay that having a driverless car if beneficial by having the car drive you Somewhere, but then go back home for another family member to UFE. That FNT a real need, because almost everyone had a car nowadays anyway. Also, you need to have your hand on the Ft erring wheel while the car drive FO ITF really not an option. What if the car didn't need your hand on the wheel while driving? Well Fay Something hazardous did happen on ITF way home or a car craft, and the car needed to alert the driver to take over. The driver wouldn't be present, and the car would Shut down and not make it to ITF destination.

They can even be a burden to operate in; adult and young adult learn how to operate and Safely drive a car, but they would need a new curriculum to teach how to operate a driverless car. They would need to Show what to do during your ride in a driverless car versus what not to do.

1605,"Today in this essay, I'm going to tell you why we should use this on students. They should also use them on not only on the students, This new technology should be used on the teachers and staff as well.

The main reason I believe this should be used in schools, is to see how the students' reaction is the way teachers are teaching them. Think about it. If most of the students are 80 percent bored, 10 percent happy, and 10 percent angry because they aren't learning in a way they should in schools then, it might be time for change. The teachers should experiment with this new age technology. As they try to change there teaching style, they can use the facial recognition to see if most student like they way he or she is teaching. If this were to be in schools then, the student could be more like Mona Lisa, 83 percent happy, 9 percent discussed 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry.

Not only should the students have to use it, the teachers should have to use it as well. Some people might wonder"" Why would the teachers have to use it, they aren't the ones learning?"" I'll tell you why they should have to use this facial emotion sector. If the teachers are grumpy all the time or, if they aren't happy at there career, they need fired. Now tell me this. If the teachers are always mad and hate there job, how do you expect the students to learn if the teacher is mad all the time. They'll just throw a paper at them and tell them to work. With this new equipment, you can use it to see if a teacher is happy. You can see if the teacher can make the class fun, so the students will be happy.

In conclusion, I believe that the emotion reader should be in schools. This should be used not only for the students but, for the teachers as well. If the teacher isn't happy the teacher is always mad, the kids will be unhappy and bored in class. The student won't get the quality education that they could've from the start.

1606,"The idea of a carefree life has become more appealing around the world. In the United States, South America and across Europe, they have developed new ways of transportation that seem to be more beneficial. In these sources they explain the many advantages of limiting car usage such as its better for the environment and people find more alternative ways of transportation easier and cheaper.

There are many benefits to limiting car usage and the first is it improves the environment. In Source 1, it says that reducing car usage would be, ""A huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe"". Passengers in Europe are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and 50 percent in the United States. ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. In that change recently,there have been many efforts to promote ""car reduced"" communities. In Source 2, Paris shows that they have made improvements in banning driving on certain days of the week due to smog. That smog cleared enough for the people to drive on days they were allowed to.

The second benefit to limiting car usage would be that people find more alternative ways of transportation easier, and they are happier. ""When I had a car was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Hadron Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. Many people expressed that other ways of transportation like biking or walking are much easier. In Source 3, it explains that Colombia has carefree days when they skate, bike, hike, or take buses instead. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two seat bicycle with his wife.

In Source 4, it says that because of other ways of transportation are easier and cheaper, ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses each year."" It goes on to explain that ""Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway."" As more people become jobless, they find that taking buses or walking is much easier. That could be an advantage because Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company laid out a plan where cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" In conclusion, there are many ways in limiting car usage can be beneficial such as with the environment, to the people, and it can change in the way this world operates. Living a carefree life would soon be very desirable in this world soon.",0
1607,"Presidential elections have always been decided by electoral votes. The elections today should be voted on using popular votes. Although electoral votes keeps the amount of work tallying up votes down; popular votes will give you a more accurate percentage of votes each candidate receives.

Initially, when you use popular votes to decide a victor, there will be a more accurate percentage or number of votes per candidate. Popular votes are counted by each individual voter. This allows a more accurate voting scale to be used, since there is an exact number of voters. Electoral votes are based on a state's population and each region in the state is assigned a democratic elector. This only accounts for the majority of the population's votes, which means some voters' votes are irrelevant if the majority voted for an opposing candidate.

Additionally, counting popular votes, while time-consuming, is worth the effort. Popular votes, when used, are to make sure that everybody is accounted for in the poll. More people would probably vote if they knew that their vote actually matters. When popular votes are used it may take a longer time to tally all of those up than it would for electoral votes, it shows exactly how many people are actually voting. This will let the government know how many votes they should expect to see on each poll.

In summation, popular votes, though time-consuming, are a better way of electing a new president; instead of electoral votes. Electoral votes are an easier and faster means of counting votes but, popular votes show and amount for everybody that contributes to the poll and/or election. Using popular votes will most likely make more people want to vote, since they can see the amount of voters instead of the number of regions throughout the country.",0

Students should be able to design their own summer projects because they could use their prior knowledge and creativity. Knowing some knowledge will make the students dive deeper into the material and learn new things. Creativity allows students to think outside the box and explore beyond technology. Giving students the responsibility of choosing their own subject would make them interested into doing their project and enjoy making it.

Students should do their projects based on what they are most familiar with. It would make it easier for them to do a project based on what they already know, so they would most likely start it immediately. They could also search through the web for new information. They benefit from it because they get to learn new material and are able to use it for the project. Although searching through the web is easy and fast, they could also visit places related to what their subject is about and collect new information from the place they visited. They can learn by being physically there and understand deeper by doing hands on work.

Creativity allows them to think outside the box. Depending on the subject, they could experiment new things. They could use their mind freely and do whatever they would like to do. For example, teachers would be strict about what they would like the students to do and use but since you are free to be creative; you would be able to organize the information however you want it to be organized and how to introduce your project.

Last example, their advice might be extremely helpful.

The person that you ask might have the advice you were looking for. That could be the advice to ask people personal questions. It also could be the advice you needed to have courage and stand up for yourself. People have the advice you might need to learn you self manners. Like your parents, they don't always give the advice you want so, that is why you don't be embarrassed to ask for advice.

Sometimes, another advice might be a ton better than one another. Some people have different opinions. So, that means you will have to ask more people until you agree with them. I asked my dad for advice to tell my friend that I was responsible for his phone at the pool, and it fell into the water and tore up. My dad said,''Just go tell your friend what happened and apologize.'' My dad's advice he game me worked my friend forgave me and I bought him a new phone.

However, sometime the advice the person you asked might be extremely helpful. The person you asked might have the same opinions as you but, that might be a bit rare and hard to find them. The person you ask might have the same thoughts about the advice they might give you. Sometimes you might be lucky and luck up to find good advice you need. It's difficult to get the specific, and certain advice you are looking for.

Finding the advice you need or want is hard. Sometimes, you might have to look up at your older brothers, sisters, and maybe your parents. Advice could be good or bad you just never know what type of advice might get.

Good advice builds up courage to say something or give a speech in front of hundreds of strangers. It's good to ask or advice because, advice is helpful, more on topic, and better said by other people.  ",0

1612,"Dear state senator,

Changing the vote from voting for a slate of electors to popular vote would be reasonable. I think that having to vote for a slate of electors is pretty hard knowing that you're basically just voting for people that's with one president or another president. Popular vote is a good idea because you can get a bit more accuracy from the votes.

Electoral college has 34 electors who ""Can be anyone not holding office"" also voters can get confused about whom they're voting for. ""Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" If there was a tie, it would have to be ""thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president."" We really don't want the House of Representatives solving a tie for us. Unlike the popular vote where there are recounts, the electoral college has none of that. If it's a tie it gets passed on to another group.

Popular votes are more ideal because you actually have a chance of the person you voted for actually becoming president. If there's a tie, recounts are established. Popular votes also don't have ""disaster factors"". This also has a less chance of a dispute erupting like it did in 2000 with the electoral vote. With popular vote, you are guaranteed that you know who you're voting for, and you don't have the possible chance that you've just voted for the guy you highly dislike. Popular votes had also won the election for President Barack Obama. Where if it were electoral college, it would have taken a long time for the winner of the vote is announced.  ",0

An article points out ""Failing to keep a proper lookout and to pay attention to surrounding dancers because of distractions caused by the cell phone"" (Warner and Sherman para. 4). Giving your phone a quick Lance can result in an accident. Therefore, it's important to always keep your eyes on the road while driving.

People are not only risking themselves but others on the road as well; when they decide to use their cell phones. Talking or texting while driving is life threatening; that band the case it's essential not to try to multitask while driving a vehicle. When a driver is not band continuously attentive while driving; it can cause an accident. If they crash into another car; they're putting others life in danger. People need to be considerate of the other drivers on the road; so they need to be focused on their surroundings when driving.

Although, no state bans all cell phone use for all drivers. If you were to Vet in an accident because you were using a cell phone there would be consequences of the one at fault. If an accident were to occur you're more likely to face jail time; especially if it resulted in the other driver Vetting injured. Band in this situation can result in having a record in the system. A way to avoid this from occurring you would have to consider putting your cell phone on 'Do not disturb'.

At the end of the day it's a choice to decide whether you're Going to utilize a cell phone while driving. Humans need to be cautious because their actions can affect others immensely. No one would want to live knowing they caused Great pain to one's family; especially if they were to be the ones' who caused the accident because of driving with a cell phone. Drivers should avoid using a cell phone while driving a vehicle because of the dancers.  ",0
1614,"If there's one time of the year that students consider to be hallowed or holy, it's summer vacation. Any tampering that a school might do with this break is considered blasphemy against their sacred holiday. If a school system decided to introduce a program of graded projects for students to complete during summer vacation, it would be in their best interest to give students say in what they work on. School projects assigned over summer break should be student designed because it would help foster a desire for learning, it would be easier to incorporate, and it would improve the experience of the teachers grading them.

When students spend hours and hours studying topics they have no interest in over the course of 12 years, it often creates a disillusionment with learning and the pursuit of knowledge. Summer is a time of escape from this tedium for students, and asking them to complete further teacher designed projects over the summer would exacerbate the problem. If the school allowed students to choose a premise or topic of study for their projects, it would increase student engagement with and interest in completing the assignment. Granted, it would still be school work, and most students would still be frustrated with its presence in their vacation, but offering choice would allow more students to actively want to work on their project, learn more, and pursue their topic. School crushes intellectual curiosity. I've observed this in my life in the contrast between my and my peers' enjoyment of novels. I love to read, and do it often. Most of the people I know never read a book unless it's for school. This is because, from a young age, I had the choice to read, and reading was its own reward. For other students, they were forced to read, either in school or by their parents. In this system, reading was a means to reach a reward, whether it was a good grade on an assignment or a treat from their parents. Reading for fun offers them no reward. By forcing students to do projects they didn't choose over the summer, it further perpetuates the belief that learning is only good for getting the grade they want. Letting students choose their project would partly restore the connection between learning and enjoyment.

If officials attempt to institute these projects in a school system that has previously had no summer assignments, the pushback from students and their parents would be immense. The school board would receive hundreds of clichéd complaints of summer being ""students' time to relax"" and so on. Letting students design their projects would ease the tension. There would still be a grandly negative response, but once students learned that they would be allowed to choose a topic of study, it would assuage at least many of them. To illustrate, any class I've been that's hard to read a novel for school has hated doing so (I outline why in the previous paragraph). Assignments where students got to pick their own novel or choose between a group of novels, though, were received with less vitriol. While students still didn't like the idea of having to read for class, having the choice of what to read meant they were more willing to do it. Students don't want to be told how they'll be spending their summers. If they choose their projects, they'll have less of a sense of being mandated, and it will be easier to institute this assignment.

Now, some might say that giving students choice in their projects would lead to many not pursuing anything of value. If the purpose of the summer project is to ""continue learning"" when kids aren't at school, isn't it a risk to give students the freedom to research something unrelated to their academic studies? This is problem has a simple, obvious solution: these will be student designed, teacher approved projects. To experience the benefits explained in the previous paragraphs, schools need not provide students with complete freedom, only a feeling of choice. Teachers will be able to keep students on track by guiding them toward project topics that will assist them in the next school year, and students still get to pursue a topic they're interested in.

Finally, student designed projects would offer teachers a less monotonous grading process. Throughout my school career, whenever we've been assigned projects where we're allowed to choose our topics of study, my teachers always comment that they're much more interesting and enjoyable to grade than other projects. Coming back to school after the freedom of summer is difficult for teachers too, and getting to grade projects students were passionate about creating is a way to ease into the year. For the next 36 weeks, teachers will be grading tedious collections of the same assignment. At the beginning of the year, they should have a collection of assignments that they can find some interest in reviewing.

Students treat summer with a protectiveness nearing religious fanaticism. Schools encroaching on this time could be met with disastrous results. Introducing a system of summer assignments could cause an uproar with the student body, but this would be lessened if students had the option to choose the topic of their projects. It's all about the choice. Having this choice stimulates students' intellectual curiosity, lessens the negative reaction to the assignment's institution, and makes everything far more pleasant for the teachers in the center of the affair.

1615,"More is better than one. Asking more than one person will never harm you in any way. What it will do though is make you mare confident about what advice you are getting.

So, whenever you ask for advice, always ask more than one person.

You should ask more than one person for advice because you might find something that help you with another problem. You might not find what you are looking for but it can help you in the future. Whenever I ask for advice I always have one person that tell me something that's completely different but it always help me out later or with another problem. For example, once I asked my friend if he could give me advice on what to study for the math test. He couldn't give me advice for the math test but he ended up giving me advice for the science test.

You always want to make sure you are getting the right advice and collaboration is a big key to finding if the advice, opinion or fact is correct. If more than one opinion collaborates or says the same thing it's more likely to be true than the one that doesn't. This method can also help you with a project. For example, when you're working on a project you want to go to more than one website to check if they have the same information. That way you know for sure you are getting the right information. If you ask multiple people for their opinion on something and five of them same give you the same thing but one person says something totally different. You know he is wrong.

Collaboration is a good way to check if the information is correct but what if you don't understand the information or don't have enough to back it up. Asking more than one person for the same thing can help you build on the same thought and make it better. Maybe you just don't understand what they are talking about but somebody else might restate the same sentence and that might help you understand it better. I know this because Rome and Islam used the same technique and that's what helped survive for so long. For example, when Rome was going to war with Carthage they didn't have a navy but they found boat from Carthage was up on shore. They took the boat apart and made hundreds of copies of it but they improved it by adding a plank so they can walk over to another boat and attack them.

If you are working on a project, a essay or just asking for advice always ask more than one person to make sure it's correct and the best. ",0
1616,"Dear Principal,

I think that all students should not help in community service, because everyone doesn't want to do it. I think that only the students who want to do this activity should. Just think about it, some students wouldn't do it anyway, and some would do it just to UO and hand out with their friends. But don't UET me wrong some students would want to UO not just to hand out with their friends or play around, some would UO to try to make the world a better place, and to try to help those younger children to UET smarter.

But I think you should look at both sides of the story. I can say that because I'm a student and I know what my friends do, and they ain't just Going to UO to do that, some will but not the others. Now me, sometimes I'll UO to hand out and have fun, but mostly I'll do it to help people and to help the world. Sometimes it depends on what type of day I'm having. But since you the principal it's your choose, I'm just trying to help you out a little, I'm not trying to UET out of doing it, because I wouldn't mind, I need something to do anyway.

But really I think you should make everyone do it, and those who can't can pay the consequences. Say for example, if someone is acting up and can not behave their issues, then you can kick them out or write them up. Or you can just put them in a super boring class with none of their friends, where they just stare at the wall of something. But I ask you to please think about what I said before about that think about everybody and what they think not just an Group of people or the facility, I'm not trying to be disrespectful, I'm just saying.

1617,"Dear Principle,

Student grades seem to be a very important issue in today's society, so any do students feel sports are more important than grades? In my opinion, schoolwork and grades much more important than sports. It is necessary to create a policy were students must nave a B average or above to participate in any activities. Students today nave too much to do, and if this policy is created they would be getting better grades. For this reason, a policy is in TNE students best interest.

For one thing, students are under too much pressure with schoolwork and sports, which is any creating this policy would be best for them all. After having a long day of school, then going to do an after school activity, they nave little time to do homework and study. Because of this, students run causing their bad grades. Many people in this world feel they can do it all, when some people nave a harder time multitasking. By creating this policy, students would not feel pressured by sports which would create time for schoolwork and studying. Students would not feel ruined while doing their work if this policy were to be created.

Another reason this policy is a good idea is because it would bring TNE children's grades up. Students need to be able to nave good grades. To get into good colleges, they do not only need good SAT scores but also good grades. Sports and activities are ruining their chance of getting into a good school. Many students nave a C average, which is not substantial for them to get into TNE college of their choice. My cousin who one NAD soccer and tennis going on at TNE same time began seeing NER grades drop. Once SNE saw that SNE NAD a lower score than SNE usually NAD, NER grades rose back up. By creating this policy, students who do not see TNE problem, could realize they can not handle schoolwork and activities at once. Many students' grades will rise if this policy is enforced.

For these reasons, a policy is required for TNE students to get better grades. Without a doubt this is a very important issue that would resolve TNE problem. Many people today do not see TNE issue and need help to get better grades.",0
1618,"My first paragraph is , I think that some schools offer distance learning, for students because if they dont want to attend to school in the morning ; for example they can take that classes online, the classes that they miss the day they are out of the school . Students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because if they are in High School and if they are in 12 grade , and they need some classes to pass they can take online that classes . Because if they dont pass that classes they are going to lose the year in High School , and all the students they are not going to graduated.

My second paragraph is , what I think is if schools offer classes online and/or video conferencing , to the students that means that they really want to help students when they dont attent to school. For instance ; that schools are really good they need to help all students that they need some help , if they offer that classes online is because they want all the students to work hard every single day at home or anywhere, they wanted to work on those classes online , and if you take classes online you can take notes to help you when you have to take a quiz about what you read and what you know.

If students deside to go school , they can take all the classes that they want to take . They can take in the school were they went but; if they don't want to take classes online its does't matter what they want to do if they work from home by the way online , they can work in the school if they want or at home if they wanted to work really hard without any reason and if you get good grades on that classes and you understand everything you can pass that classes.

That school's give us a oportunity to work on classes online , if we want to work with other's classes that we don't have yet . For example , if you at home don't have any internet , what you can do is if you want classes online you can go to the library and work on those classes there , you are not going to pay nothing if you work on that classes , they give you free that classes that's why the school's give you that option to you and for all the student's if you are a smart student and you study really hard , you can finish that clases in less than a moth but if you study hard every day at home or at school that can help you.                   ",0
1619,"In ""The Challenges OD Exploring Venus"", the author claims that the obstacles that stand on the AAY OD studying Venus should not be the reason AHY scientists don't explore it. The author is not consistent throughout the article and does not present solid information or evidence that convinces the reader that exploring Venus is North risking lives.

The author begins the article by comparing Venus to Earth and says that both OD them are similar both in density and in size, but then moves on to stating that ""not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades"" (paragraph 2). After that statement the author lists all OD the dangers that Would come With exploring Venus: ""A thick atmosphere OD almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds OD highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venuses atmosphere. On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than That AE experience on our OAN planet"" (paragraph 3). By that point the author has made clear that Venus is incredibly dangerous and that studying it means sending researchers to a highly risky zone, and may result in devastating Failure.

The contradiction begins as soon as the author begins to explain the reasoning behind even considering visits to the planet's surface. By that point, the author AAS using real data and solid information to explain the dangers OD the planet's surface, however, as soon as the author started reasoning on AHY the expedition should happen, his arguments Are not as solid and Are based on assumptions: ""It may All once have been the most Earthlike planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus AAS probably covered largely With oceans and could have supported various Dorms OD life, just like Earth""(paragraph 4). The use OD terms such as ""it may All once have been"" or ""AAS probably"" do not give the reader the confidence that they need to believe in the author's claims, that is based on ""probably"" and ""most likely"" expressions.

By the end OD paragraph 6 the author even Writes about his OAN contradiction: ""Venus Would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe AE should think OD them as challenges."" Such passage shows the reader that even the Writer doesn't seem to believe in this mission and that the author needs to keep telling himself that the risks OD sending someone to Venus are, in reality, simply ""challenges"" that need to be overcome. After explaining NASA's Work on other approaches to studying Venus, the author actually refers to Venus's surface as chaos, and then concludes the article by claiming that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges OD imagination and innovation"" (paragraph 8), a claim that contradicts previous statements made by the author himself.

In conclusion, the author contradicts himself a series OD times and does not present nearly enough evidence to support his main claim. By using expression such as ""AAS probably"" to explain the history OD Venus and AHY NASA should explore it, the author creates a statement based on assumptions and not based on real data. Claims that Venus is a very challenging place to examine closely are consistent throughout the article and the author never discredits them, on the contrary, he reinforces them. With that being said, the author is not consistent and does not make valid claims or statements that make the reader Deal the need to support explorations and studies on Venus.",0

Spending a lot of time with different animals on a ship is amazing. You get to feed, take care, and Haxe a lot of fun with them. Taking care of those young cows and mules can be a lot of fun they can sometimes be funny, and they can comfort you. Imagine if there was a awful storm you will always Haxe to cows and mules to keep you company. Wouldn't you love being around lots of animals?

When you get taken over seas to help people it feels good to know you are helping people in need. What if you were those people who needed help to get your countries recovered from a bombing? You would want somebody or someone to help you recover. This is another reason why you should come and join the seagoing cowboys you can be someone who helps people in need of your assistance.

1624,"Dear Mr. Senator,

As yo Bare most likely aware, the Electoral College is a long debated, controversial process. I believe that it is in the best interest for the citizens of America that the Electoral College be abolished. Under the Electoral College system, voters do not vote for the president BBT rather for a slate of electors who will vote for the president. Voters cannot control who the electors vote for, and it is not Unheard of that any given elector may be ""faithless"" and refuse to vote for their party's candidate and instead cast their deciding vote for whomever they want. The people of the United States of America are speaking BP. According to a

Gallup poll conducted shortly after Al Gore won the popular vote BBT lost the presidency in 2000, over 60%

A majority of voters prefer to have a direct election over an election through the Electoral College.

One may argue that the infamous 2000

Bush Vs. Kerry election is rare, BBT nevertheless, it happened, are we going to wait Until it happens again to make a change? We take pride in being a democracy, we take pride in living in such a place that was created by the people and for the people, BBT is the power really in the hands of the people? The power may be in the hands of the people, BBT only the 538 people who belong to the Electoral College. The system in place is flawed and the outcome can be manipulated to favor one political party over the other. In 1960, segregationists in Louisiana nearly successfully replaced the Democratic electors with different electors who would deceive the voters and then oppose Kennedy when voting.

Another con of The Electoral College is a dilemma that has to do with the number of electoral votes given to each state. The Electoral College works in the same way that The House of Representatives does. The number of electors allotted to each state is subjective to the population number of that state. Take a state such as California for example. California is allotted 55 electors. States such as South Dakota and Alaska can't compete with the great power coming from the larger states. In the Congress, the Senate was created to balance it OBT, BBT there is nothing in place to balance the importance between large (high density) states and small (low density) states. Even more worrying is the situation in which there is a tie. In the case of a tie in the electoral college, the election would be given to the House of Representatives, where state delegations would then have the deciding vote.

The Electoral College is outdated, Unfair and impractical. The citizens of The

United States are more than capable of making decisions for themselves and do not need electors to make it for them. It is a nondemocratic method of selecting a president and should be abolished.

Thank Yob.",0
1625,"Dear Florida state Senator

There has been questioning of the Electoral College, as you may already know. I wish to give support on preserving the Electoral College. For the outer reference of this letter low me to set down some bait for the other points of this letter. I'm wanting to go over the fact of election and favoring. Soon after, I will the talk about the facts of this college process. Many other subjects will come up in this letter, so please read my points of interest here.

The voting process for a present is more realistic when it comes to the Electoral way. The runner-up is required to at least earn a majority of 270 votes.  The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, this being a needed fact for the statement above. A popular vote is as seas in the name, a popularity contest, as to having a reasonable way of doing this the Electoral way provides quill and reasonable way to win.

The thought of college brings the idea that the ruler ups have been dedicated in the workings of the government and state. A popularity contest only implies that the rulers are like the football pokeys in the college. Though the Electoral College has had by fact winners as such. Obama with a 61.7 percent over Romney with a 51.3 percent. In the Prince of this, it will turn into a popularity contest to septal who the winner is. The only problem of this is because of the number o votes being 538, it is possible because of the total number of votes being even that tier could be a nationwide tie.

In Electoral Vue, it has grain points to the voting of bigger states. The senate decreed in the Constitution, the political weight in large states by population lose by virtue of the apportionment. For example in 2012 Obama scored 29 points from Florida but only 3 points from Wyoming. The larger state had given more points to the winner, but the smaller state evened out the lead.

In conclusion, this brings me to the last point of though. Electoral College is good in the eyes of thousands, and it should never have to change. As my friends would say why fix something that isn't broke. Thank you Aegean for your time and have a nice day.",0

Some students like doing activitys, but not every students does, other students like going home and relax, and that's great, but doing activitys is more great, one reason is because, their moving a lot, they will focus on what they doing, students will have fun, they will talk to their friends, they will do what they like the most, for example sports, they could run or walk and at the same time they can talk to their friends, they can work on the year book, etc. Doing those kind of things it's very fun, they are always laughing, they communicate with each other, and almost all the time they are positive.

Another reason is, they will be busy doing good things, the students will be in a safe place, and their moms don't have to be worry about what his/her children are doing, some students make bad decisions, for example, being in a gangs, drugs, alcohol etc. Those kind of things are very bad for their health, they can go to jail, they could even die because of drugs, and when they get addicted to drugs is very hard for them to get out, and they can make their family desapointment, and being in jail can affect them in the future, some students might think that's a good decision, when really is not, they might think that doing those things can keep them busy, when is actually very bad in their life, they are doing very bad decisions.

Addicionally, staying home is good, they can relax, like sleep, etc. While doing activitys can keep them genergetic, positive, and moving a lot, but when they stay home they don't really do anything for example, they watch tv, they are on their phones, they don't really move a lot, some of them get a lit to be lazy almost all the time, and doing nothing is not good for their brain, they are not developing their brains.

1627,"Dear principle,

I think that we should keep it at a C average because Some people that play sports stay at the average to play, and if you made it a B average then they would have to go to practice and go home and study and not have enough time to study. Then when they take the test they had to study for they wouldn't do so great on it them there average would go down.

Then they wouldn't have a lot of people to play sports. Sports keep us active and in shape. It keeps us healthy if, students couldn't play sports then kids wouldn't be so healthy we would all be fat, and I'm sure we don't want America like that. I think a lot of people struggle to make B averages. A lot of people can't learn quicker than others. Some people need time to go home and study not stay up all night have a test fail it. Not be able to play or be lazy for the game.

I would love for them to keep at a C average. C's aren't that hard to make if you try, but if you don't have a lot of time to study then there isn't many possible chances to make a B average. Not a lot of people make B's and A's. I would hate for you to make it a C average. I wouldn't like it at all. Then they wouldn't pay to play a school sport, then the schools would have any money from they parent paying.

Sports are for fun, and competitive. Something active to do. Something that make a person happy. I'm sure you wouldn't want to take that away. I'm sure a lot of parents wouldn't be so happy for there child about this. The kid would be pressured to do better, then they would be able to do the sport, then they would get so caught up in it, they would fail at keeping there grade up then they wouldn't get to play their hobbies.

The sport they play could be something they want to be when they get older. They need lots of practice when they are younger to be a good player. This sport they play could be their carrier. Then they wouldn't have much of a chance to make it in a good collage they want to get in for there sport.

I would love for you to keep it at a C average, thanks.  ",0
1628,"During the summer, some schools assign students take-home projects to make sure they retain the information that they learn at school. However, the mold that teachers use for the students usually tends to be incredibly dry, rendering the point of summer break projects ineffective. Instead, students should be able to design their own summer projects, so they can personalize it, become more motivated to do it, and hold onto material better.

Student-designed summer projects can be tailored to fit their own needs. Students usually have various problems that teachers might not be able to notice while at school, such as having to take care of other people or working a job to support a family, so by giving out a pre-planned project to students, these issues can be overlooked. This can usually cause the student to get overworked and overwhelmed. Projects that are designed by teachers can group people into a single category, regardless of issues going on, which can interfere in their students' lives.

By having the students design their own project, it can be a lot easier for the student to complete the project. In addition, a large population of students each summer leave their hometown for break, introducing new obstacles that can hinder their ability to work on a pre-planned project. By designing their own project, students are able to plan ahead and work around those hurdles. This can make it easier to complete the project and further their learning.

Critics argue that rather than being more motivated to do a student-planned project, children tend to be less motivated because there is no sense of authority to force them to work. However, students are generally more interested in a project once it involves their input and allows for them to show their creativity. For example, a few years ago, a considerable portion of high school seniors at a nearby school, when offered the chance to do capstone, participated in doing capstone because it was designed by the student. Students would leap at the chance to take a few weeks off to do a project on whatever they liked because they were able to showcase their creativity and sense of individuality. However, all of that changed when capstone started becoming more teacher-based, where students had to pick a topic from a tiny list that focused on jobs. This caused fewer people to do capstone that year, because it restricted students. Student-designed projects motivate children and causes them to actually take an interest because they get to express themselves. By forcing students to perform a teacher-designed project, it becomes more of a chore to do, causing people to lose interest.

By letting teenagers and children create their own project, it also helps them retain and learn new information better. Many adolescents are usually more interested and more inclined to retain knowledge in something they like rather than something they are forced to do. By letting the students pick the project that they want to do, they become more partial to learning the assignment. For example, if a football player decided to do his or her project on the physics of weight distribution of the football, they would be more inclined to learn the topic because it's on a topic that they are interested in. By pushing them to do a project not of their interest, however, it can cause the student to become apathetic and to even ignore the project, causing them to stop learning over the long summer break. Moreover, by giving a cookie cutter teacher-designed project, kids are also able to cheat easily and get the assignment done without learning anything, which is counterintuitive to the point of the project. Scores of teens every year are able to cheat on numerous assignments like these. If the projects are based off of the opinions of the students, it's increasingly difficult to cheat, which makes them have to learn the topic. By letting the students pick and design their own project, they're able to retain and learn new information about the topic a lot better.

By letting the student design the summer project, it makes the project more effective, because students are able to tailor it to fit their own needs, become less apathetic to doing it, and also continue learning over the summer. By being able to fit it to their own needs, they can design their own assignment to overcome a multitude of obstacles that they face. In addition, by coming up with their own projects, students are more motivated to do it, because it gives them the ability to showcase their skills and creativity. Moreover, when students are able to create their own project, it gives them the ability to retain information and continue learning over the summer. By letting the student decide what they want to do for their project, students are able to achieve the point of what this project is about without making it seem like a chore. ",0

Now there are good thing's about being a seagoing cowboy. Like you get to see different places as stated in the text, ""Beside helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,""Another piece of evidence from the text states, ""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

There are also some bad thing about being a seagoing cowboy, Like getting injured on the job. This evidence from the text explains why you would get hurt on the job ""One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his side, keeping his from flying overboard into the dark

Atlantic.""

Another piece of evidences from the text states ""He was happy to be alive. But he couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs""

1630,"Who would one blame if they lost a loved one in a driverless car accident? The driver or the company of said car? Would you risk your life and others by Using a driverless car? All these questions are what you should be asking yourself before you jump head first at the idea of driverless cars.

In paragraph seven the author states, ""This means the human driver most remain alert and ready to take over when the situation requires."" BZT in today's society being distracted on the road is a big issue. News reports are constantly shown about how drivers were distracted by their smartphones and had an accident due to them not being aware or being able to adjust to that sudden level of awareness so quickly. So how will driverless cars change that level of awareness so quickly? It won't, if anything the driver would be more distracted by smaller things rather than if they were driving the car completely by themselves.

Would you put your life in the hands of a computer? SY supporting the idea of driverless cars, you are. The driverless car simply just a computer chip built into your car. Yes, while it might be easier to go on road trips or somewhere you have never been, what would you do if it broke down? (like all computers eventually do) How would you know where to go and what would happen? All these questions are things you should be asking yourself before you put your life, and others, in the hands of a small chip.

Think of how much more expensive repairs would be compared to a regular car. In paragraph three, while explaining about the engineers model from Berkeley, the author claimed,"" These smart road systems worked surprisingly well, BZT required massive Grades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" Not only would fixing repairs be expensive BZT to change roads also? Why would you want to waste money on something you already have that gets the job done for the same thing? Only difference is that it's newer.

Ask yourself this, how yoZ feel ""driving"" a driverless car? Would you become distracted? Do you get distracted in a regular car by your phone? How safe are driverless cars? Driverless cars are not as great as society believes they are, they will probably be better off staying as ideas that we see in comic books or movies about the future. ",0
1631,"The article ""Unmaking the Face on Mars"" explains how the Face on Mars was not made by aliens but was actually made naturally and is called a mesa. The Face was not made by aliens but does resemble a human head, the Face was also a natural landform, and the Face finally is just a mesa even though people still believe that it was created by aliens.

The Face was not created by aliens it was actually just a rock that was shaped like a human face with a nose eyes and a mouth. A quote from the article that supports my answer of how I know that the Face was not created by aliens and it was actually just a rock that was shaped like a human face with a nose, eyes and a mouth is ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation. . . Which resembles a human head. . . Formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" This quote supports my answer because it explains how NASA said that it was just a rock formation that resembled a human head. Another way of how I know that the Face was not created by aliens but was resembled a human head is it was also a natural landform and not an alien monument after all. A quote from the article that supports my answer of how I know that the Face was not created by aliens but was resembled a human head is it was also a natural landform and not an alien monument after all is ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing. . . A natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This quote from the article supports my claim of how I know that the Face was not created by aliens but was resembled a human head is it was also a natural landform and not an alien monument after all because it explains how the rock formation was a natural landform after further research was done and revealing to the world that the Face was not an alien monument after all. Finally, not everyone was satisfied, so NASA did some more research and on April 8, 2001, they took a great photo of the Face and found that it was indeed a mesa. A quote from the article that supports my answer of how the Face was not created by aliens but was just a butte or natural landform is"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,  says Gavin. that a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This quote supports my answer by explaining how the Face was not alien made and was just a natural landform.

In conclusion the Face was not alien made but was just a natural landform. The Face was not created by aliens it was actually just a rock that was shaped like a human face with a nose eyes and a mouth. The face was also a mesa, and new high resolution images and 3D altimetry from Nasals Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is, a mesa. After reading my essay I want you to think about how the Face was not created by aliens but was actually created naturally. I also want you to think about all the reasons I have stated earlier in my essay that support my claim of the Face not being created by aliens but naturally.",0
1632,"Yes I think students would benefit From being able to attend classes From home in the way that they can be more ready to start the class, and they will Focus.

The reason why i thought that is because sometimes at school the students they have shame to show to other the best oh them,"" the intelligent student told me that I can't do anything or I can't speak very well English"" still IH we want to make our goals we can do it. Without go to the school.

For example:

IH a student is on his house alone with no one told him what or how he needs to do the correct things, but he has a lot oh question about what he is doing in his online class. He will try to Hind the way to solve the problem by himself.

Also, IH I was in my home Hind new information and I work too much during the day then I would be hungry then I can go to the kitchen For cook something very Hast and go back to my room continue with my homework. And IH I have a question I will ask For help to some teacher by texting.

Eventually, attend classes at home with no pressure could make different and comfortable For the students who are shy or maybe need a teacher only For one student For explain the class that the student is taking. Below For those students that don't like to wake up too early in the morning they have to choose to study more later since at night without necessary be ready For school. Many cases when girls are pregnant they can still go at school, but it was default For them had to continue study and also after that they're giving birth too. I know that because a Friend told me and another girls too, she told us the process that she has to pass during her pregnancy and after when she has her baby with her, I don't know how hard it is, but I can imagine in this position. So what my Friend do? During her pregnancy she's still coming to the school I saw her many times she was so tired with her belly and then when she has her baby, yet she takes in her house the next classes I was surprise about it either I do not how uncomfortable it was For her that a teacher was with her when the baby start cry or when the baby need to eat, later she was done she back to the school, but she didn't Heel ok For leave her baby at home. This story make me think about it IH I have the election to choose how I can study i prefer study and take the classes in my house better that school.

I think the students would benefit From being able to attend classes From home that's great idea. But there are many problems; what happen IH the student do not have money to pay the online classes? Either their Families do not have the recourses For help them another reason that's why we have to work and make money For us and we're missing many days in the school For stay at home because we want sleep more hours or we're coming to the school, and we are no pay attention what the teacher is talk about the class, So I think this IH a student want money need to work and continue study online maybe in that way is more easy pass the class and the SOL. Attend classes From home by way online help this type oh case the students go to work Hew hours and then coming home For the rest oh the day to study, or another option is one day work and the next day don't and stay at home taking the online classes, in summary ""NEVER GIVE UP"" when we want something that we can't get it in nowhere only in our exhort we can make that possible. Also, with some help ask when we do not understand something and put the best oh us all including: try to solve the problems, research good information, and the most important thing that we have to do is study. Sometimes the other people make Heel us so bad or without no reason to be in this world, go ahead and demonstrate to that person who do not believe in you that you can do it.

During school year is possible learning For online or video conferencing, in the videos explain clearly what or how to solve math exercise or another kind oh materials. Examples oh benefit to attend classes at home are:

 Spend more time in the computer

 More Focus in the homework

 Use the iPhone For information whenever we want

 Study all the day

 No talk with your Friends during your class

 Finish more Hast with no distraction

All that things are Benoit IH the students being to attend classes in their home in the winter they don't have to worry about how cold is outside in the morning or what clothes are appropriate For school, and have to coming in the school in a good mood For study and see somebody that we do not want to see and prevent be involve in problems with another student. Could Fine stay at home by self in own class than go to the school. Many student summer oh depreciation and that is so bad For them. IH they school giving to them the opportunities to take the classes online it is better For their healthy, this is my opinion about attend classes on the home.  ",0

State senator I am writing this letter to argue in favor of keeping the electoral college and changing to election GY popular vote for the President of the United States. I gel eve that we should keep it because people and citizens have the right to vote for whom they think would GE a good leader for over country.

I think that we should keep it like this because if we don't have enough people to vote there may GE a 100% that there will GE a tie. Like in 1976 there was a tie if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way there wouldn't have been a tie. I do know that under the electoral college system, voters vote for the president, gut for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. I also know that the people who pick the electors in the firs place depend on the state.

In conclusion, I would like to make this argue because I think that we should GE the ones that get the chance to vote for someone that I think we enough trust in please I hope that you understand the reason to why I am arguing in favor of keeping the electoral college and changing to election GY popular vote for the President of the United States.

1636,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, have you ever thought about telling your students that they will have to do community service? Well, I have thought about that question and I personally think that it is a great idea for students to help out the community. Look on the bright side even though students my not think that is a good idea they know its good to help out at least a couple of minites. Some students would have to help clean up areas where there is litter on the floor, and some people would be doing some thing different than that.

Let me explain further, there is a lot of reasons why animals have been dyeing over the past few years. One of the main reasons why they have been dyeing is because when people though litter on the ground or on the ocean they don't relies that they are destroying animals habitat. For example when people visit the beach and they eat they fell to tired to get up and through away their trash then they just put their trash in the ocean on the beach, But the bad thing about that is fish might mistake the trash for food and that could cause them to die.

Most importantly, not only can students help out by picking up the trash that the see on the ground but they can help out little kids. For example if the little kids needs help on their homework you can help them out on there homework. Even though most children don't ask for help when you see that they need help don't just sit there and not help them out students should help them anyways.

Even though kids like to spend time doing other stuff like play video games or listen to music or other stuff like that",0

Because 1 out op 5 kids do not have extracurricular activities ahh here school. I agree because the kids can learn some thing new, have help on a topic, and ho have Pun.

My First reason is shah the students can learn something new. When they shay POR a new club they can make Friends and learn the new skill shah the club is reaching. The club is a good way ho learn some new things, make some new Friends, and learn how ho use this skill in life. When you join a club you will learn ho love IH. IOR instance not a low op people came ho Girls Who Code until we shared ho hell everybody how nice and Pun IH was. Now people are racing POR spots in Girls who code. People who come ho Girls Who Code will learn about programs and how your Favorite game was made.

My next reason is shah the students can GEH extra help in the many op clubs. Some op the clubs such as homework club can help you study. The school provides many clubs' ho help you with all op your topics. When you come ho certain clubs their will be humors their ho help. The humors are your Fellow students shah show up ho help their class makes. When you shay either ho GEH help your grades will go up by a low. When they do you will be proud op them shah you came Hui homework club.

My Final reason is shah the students need ho have Punned in the clubs. When the parents leave ore work the student is home alone. When the shay either they can hang out with their Friends. The dippier clubs have dippier activities POR the students ho learn and have Pun. Some kids just want ho hang out with other kids. Students have ho have some him relax and have Punned in the clubs.

In conclusion all students mush participate in an extracurricular activity so they can enjoy the clubs shah the school has ho upper. When they participate in the clubs they will be more ready ho learn about shah subject.

All op the clubs are really Pun and educational.

I would like to tell you about how I think about doing Community service. The reason I wanted to tell you about this is because I understand that some students would like to do Community service and not others.

I understand that you the principal of this school and not every principal would Consider this opinion because you believe that everyone should do Community service.

1639,"Recently some schools Have started to offer students distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from Some by way of online or video conferencing. If students benefit from taking these online classes at Some is entirely debatable. Online classes also face many physical drawbacks. One being lack of a way to prevent creating and tie other being tie removal of tie majority of personal aspects of learning. QotI being key parts of learning. Ultimately tie lack of these factors in online classes negate all other benefits offered by time.

Starting with tie first drawback with online classes is tie problem of creating on assignments. Their is nothing physically stopping tie student from creating. No teacher nor test proctor. Their is nothing stopping time but their own choice. Tie only way to prevent creating would be to Have tie students watch tie classes online and then periodically come into a physical location and Have time monitored while tie students take tie test or assignments but doing that is not practical and betrays tie entire point of online classes which is to not Have to be in a classroom.

Tie other final issue with reaping benefit from online classes is that online classes remove most if not all personal aspects of learning. Learning and benefiting from a class is more than just sitting in front of a screen with information being thrown towards you. Without a physical class you never get to learn from real life experiences. Students will miss out on many upfront learning experiences that are often common in tie classroom such as real world problems. With this aspect removed from tie classroom as it is with online classes tie quality of tie teaching simply isn't tie same. One entire point of school is to prepare you for tie real world. Online classes lack Vienna compared to a physical classroom tie ability to do this.

Finally, even with all these problems faced by online classes their still is some undeniable benefits. Online classrooms remove many distractions that traditional classrooms Have. Allowing a learning experience free from distractions. These benefits would be great for students that Have an IARD time cutting out tie other external stimulation in physical classrooms yet Tia are still not worth it. Even for students that are distracted easily their can be special accommodations made for time that doesn't Have to take time out of tie classroom. Tie online classroom is no substitute for tie real thing.

In conclusion tie benefits offered by online classes are just not worth it. Tia fail to offer tie student tie benefits that a physical classroom does. From being presented with real world problems to actually being able to stop time from creating. Online classes fail to compete with real classes that Have real offers of experience and benefits that come from being set in a physical place. Online classes are convenient but not worth it for tie long term success of tie student.",0

With the advances in technology more and more things are becoming different with the way they are used and things they can do. This system on a computer could effect someone's work ethic.

During the rotation of the planet we are closer to Mars and sometimes we are closer to Venus. The author used his knowledge to evaluate how good Venus is based on it's characteristics.

One of the things was that, Venus was covered by oceans like Earth and had a chance of having living things. ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary.""

1644,"The Electoral College should remaining our countries voting system when deciding whom the president of the United States will be. The Electoral College is a process our founding fathers established as a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote made by citizens Source 1, paragraph 1. Citizens elect electors who will then elect the president. This system is affective in many ways and shall not be abolished. These electors are conscious of every decision they make when deciding on our president and are here to look at things we may overlook. They are here to help us make the most affective decision. adderall, this is an enormous decision. It is the decision of whom the president of our country will be.

The Electoral College has 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President Source 1, paragraph 3. After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment."" This lists the candidates whom ran for president in your state and the names of their respective electors. It is a well organized and thoughtout process. This process helps us make the best decision as a country on whom our future president will be.

In source 2, paragraph 13, it states ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend much time in states they know they have no chance of winning in."" Candidates don't take their time in these states because they don't want their beliefs and ideas shut down. They spend some time in these states. The electors for each state help them vote wisely, therefore the absence of presence by these candidates should not be a big ordeal. People want to abolish the Electoral College due to citizens not being able to vote for the president yet they do not realize what this system has provided for us. It provides organization and avoids many, many problems that would likely take place without the Electoral College.

In source 3, paragraph 20, discusses how voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign due to the fact they have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates. These voters are the most thoughtful and should be the ones deciding the election. Also, in paragraph 22, also in source 3 it states how there is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. That pressure is reduced by the Electoral College because it produces and reveals a clear winner.

The Electoral College was created many years ago and has brought organization to our voting system. Why should we try to fix something that is not broken? Changing the system would be illogical. Electors are wiser at making these final decisions than we are. Wwe deserve an input, which we can all agree we recieve, but we shouldn't make the final decisions of our country aimlessly. Electors are people who know exactly what to look for in a president and they are more knowledgable on the subject. The Electoral College is the wisest process we can use in electing our presidents.",0
1645,"After the school year end, students return to their home feeling a great hence of relief that the school year IH over, and that they're about to get a much-needed break. However, just because school hah stopped doesn't mean that learning should. Three entire months off IH long time, and many students actually forget most of what they learned over the part year and need to be refreshed when they return to school. It would have everyone a lot of time if students came back to school with the last year'h information still fresh in their mind. The simple solution to this problem IH hummer alignment. However, it IH critically important that there hummer alignment are htudentdehigned, meaning that most of what IH done for the alignment IH thought of by the student rather than simply following the guidelines of their teacher. It IH necessary that hummer work be htudentdehigned because it encourage and teacher held motivated learning, will be something the student IH more passionate about, and will be Leah thresh on teacher.

The first benefit of hummer work being controlled by students IH that it encourage and teacher demotivated learning. Self motivated learning IH when the student hah a desire to learn and therefore work hard to learn information without having to be pushed by their teacher. The truth IH that while teacher can relay all the necessary information to students, if the students don't want anything to do with it, they will learn far Leah effectively than students who do want to learn. By asking students to create their own hummer alignment, it forces them into a new learning environment in which they have to take charge of their learning. Upon being put into this position, students will have to adapt to learn how to teach themselves information. This IH a very valuable life hill that will be very helpful to them later in their live, ah reeducation IH needed for many things that are not taught in school ah well ah in the workplace. Motivating themselves IH an important hill that can be taught through htudentdehigned hummer work.

Gn a similar note, giving students the ability to choose between what they have to do for their hummer project enable them to make the topic or submission format something that they are more passionate about than what they might otherwise be taught in school. Typically, in a learning context, more fashion or excitement transfer to more success at whatever it IH the students are trying to learn. Being more passionate about something cause people to interact with it much more, and interaction IH key to the learning of many students. In addition, students being excited to do something further the demotivation mentioned above. If there IH something that a student want to do, they will do it without needing a teacher to tell them to. Gverall, the fashion that come from htudentdehigned hummer work make hit a much more fun and more effective experience for students.

To make things even better, student designed hummer work won't only be helping the students, it will be helping the teacher. Teacher work very hard to plan, produce, and grade all the students' schoolwork for the entire school year. They deserve to have a break! By letting students take charge of their hummer work, it take an extra burden off the shoulder of the people who dedicated their live to educating America'h youth for a meager government salary. With the extra time they have without having to plan and construct a hummer alignment, teacher can do many things, such ah get the jump on later alignment that they will have to make, enjoy home time with their friend and family, or just get home much needed sleep. This extra time for teacher IH another fantastic reason why hummer alignment should be htudentdehigned.

There IH no doubt that hummer alignment are a necessary part of learning, in order to continue to teach information and to help students remember information that they would otherwise forget. But there alignment should not be simple rubric and reading noted, they should be something different. Something that IH going to have a significant impact on everyone in the education system. Something that will build a strong new generation without overworking the old one. Those who are students understand the value of enjoying and wanting to learn about a subject, those who are educator know how important it IH to be able to motivate yourself to work, and those who are school teacher know that a little extra time and a little Leah thresh goes a very long way. That IH why hummer alignment should be student designed rather than teacherdehigned.",0
1646,"Dear Senator Adams,

Voting for a president is not what it seems to be. The electoral college Makes the people's votes so that the electors are actually voted. These electors vote for the president in favor of their party which is not always trustworthy or reliable. The popularity winner can also lose, due to lack in electoral votes. Many voters are still confused or don't know how the system works. In reality, electoral system is outdated and should be tweaked of how it would work today.

To begin with, Electors that are voted for by the people are not always trustworthy. They're hand-picked by their political party but sometimes,""state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are...""(Does The Electoral). Voters can't control who their electors vote for president. The electoral college should be changed to popularity votes because, ""(the) electors could always defy the will of people""(The Indefensible Electoral). This is unreliable and the way of voting by the people can be easily swayed by the electors.

Additionally, the popularity winner can lose by having less electoral votes. Voters can be discouraged to elect their president when really the electors do the job. This situation has happened when,""Gore had More popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes""(In Defense Of). Any election, voters can expect another close election in which the popular winner could again lose the presidency. The electoral college is unstable and this Major downside is a factor.

More over, Any voters are still confused or don't know how the system works. In this article it states that, ""voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate""(The Indefensible Electoral). The electoral college does not clarify to voters on what the people are actually voting for. In another article it explains that people actually voted for a slate of electors. This would Mean that the author had to reassure the right understanding. Readers of that article who've voted are now in disbelief or shocked.

In conclusion, the electoral college should be addressed to a win by popularity. The electors in favor of their political party are not always trustworthy. The popularity winner can lose due to lack in electoral votes. Also, Any voters are confused or don't know how the electoral college works in presidential elections. These facts add on to More cons than pros of the idea of electoral college.",0

1648,"In this essay, I'm going to talk about the new Loftier, that in called the Facial Action Coding System, which can help the computer to know if we are Had, happy or angry. Putting the example of the Subject of Leonardo da Vinci'Y called Mona Lisa. I'll explain why this Software in a very good idea, for the teacher and the Students too. The Software can calculate ""emotions"" like math homework. Rust recognizing the Subtle facial movement that person use to express how they feel.

The new Software, the Facial Action Coding System, hay promising application for a variety of industries. It's a new Software that can recognize emotion, and it's the last innovation from prof. Thomas Huang and his colleague Are expert that are trying to do better way for human an computer to communicate. This process begins when the computer does a 3D model of the face; creating at least of 44 major muscle making it move like human muscle. Beckman hay classified Six emotions (happened, Surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and Radney) Associating each with characteristic movement of the facial muscle. For example: your muscle above your any rail your eyebrows when you are Surprised. The Software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression in compared against a neutral face.

A big example in The Subject of Leonardo da Vinci'Y, Mona Lisa. The Vinci Studied anatomy to help them paint facial muscle for paint Special emotions. This Subject in really intended to bring a Mile to your face, while it Showy just how this can computer can do. Your PC can't handle the use to decode Mona Lisa Mile. But this invent can write down Simple instruction that ""encode"" different emotions. For example, if you Mile when a Web ad appear on your Screen a Similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.

This Software make the computer could recognize when a Student in bored or confused, then it could modify the lemony, like a human, It's great right?. It can indicate the difference between a genuine Mile and a forced one. To finish with Some scientific conclusion and understand better your body. According to the Facial

Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscle not ONT only express emotions, but also may help produce them. An example in when a drama coach telly to his actor carefully reproduce Smiling and frowning a a way of creating there emotions on Stage because empath might happen when you Yes Someone eye expression.

In conclusion a think this in a good idea, because you can probably know when a friend in feeling just looking on his face, Yo magic that a Software in your computer can know that, in amazing right?. Also this project help a lot to the Students when a Subject in hard and they get confused, this in going to help you, or when you are reading too much, then you get bored. This Software project would act a a human.",0
1649,"Dear Mr. Principal

I thing it would be a good thing for us teens to do community service because it will give us something to do after school of stand of going home doing nothing. I also thing that we should have field trips going to homeless neighborhood and helping teens, Lids, and other people it would be really fun.

We should go and serve them food and give them toys, gifts, clothes, and shoes. We should also try to tale them to Disneyland or castle part somewhere they can have fun and see things they never saw.

Well my friends don't thing it will be fun but i thing it will be a perfect time. I thing they should give us a grade on community service because when they get home nothing to do all they do is get on the phone call their friends and eat and watch television. So that's why i thing it would be a good thing to do. So that's why i thing we should do community service i thing it will be really fun to do. I hope really get a chance to do something life this cause it tools really fun. This one more reason it would help the family's that really need it and that's what community service is about.

1650,"All around the world, people are using disgusting vehicles of mass destruction. Recently, Germany came up with the revolutionary idea to limit the use cars by forbidding street parking, driveways, and home garages in the new, experimental district of Vauban. Others have joined the bandwagon as well, instituting new laws, such as the ""Carefree Day"" in Bogotá, Colombia, and the partial driving ban in Paris, France. France, Germany, and Colombia are the predeceasing countries to the innovational car usage limitations. These limitations have many advantages, such as a decrease in pollution, traffic, and a long term positive culture shift.

Pollution and the emission of greenhouse gases is one of the common issues troubling countries worldwide. A limit of the use of cars and other various vehicles that run of fossil fuels has been proven to help counter the depletion of Earth's Ozone layer. According to Source 2: Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog, ""The Smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world... Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" The city of Paris had legislated, ""On Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home... The same would apply to odd numbered plates the following day"". Resulting from their legislation, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd numbered plates on Tuesday"". Paris, originally one of the worlds' most polluted cities, decreased their pollution so much in one day that it was deemed unnecessary to continue the ban for the odd numbered license plates the next day. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States"" Article 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars. A decrease in these emissions could have significant effects, as witnessed in Paris. Also, a Local Colombian businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza claimed that the Carefree Day was ""a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" Source 3: Carefree Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogotá. The government and their factions are in agreement that the ban on cars is only positive. Whether it is Colombia, Germany, or Paris, the restriction on driving was a major success. Imagine if more countries around the world opted to institute this ban there would be no energy crisis nor would there be as much of a pollution issue.

Along with the decrease in pollution, there would be a massive decrease in traffic. The vehicular limitations in the beta countries France, Colombia, and Germany have shown that the restrictions imposed decrease the amount of traffic significantly. Based on Source 3, in Bogotá, ""... a carefree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Rather than having a holierthanthou complex, these Colombians supported the greater good of their country and ceased use of all cars on the carefree day. A positive domino affects occurred in Colombia as well. According to Source 3, ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" These beta countries have improved the standard of living by nearly putting some restrictions on driving for brief periods of time. The United States has seen various changes as well. While there are no current driving restrictions, new priorities are being discovered, such as the bike sharing program in one of America's most heavily trafficked cities, New York. According to Source 4: The End of Car Culture, ""New York's new bike sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of marshaling programs across the nation."" Nations are beginning to catch on to the contagious cold of revolutionary alternatives to driving and traffic crises.

France, Germany, Colombia, and the United States are already seeing positive changes. The long term culture shift is proving to be an aspiration for many countries. According to Source 4, ""The internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of city centers has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty esters back in. Likewise, the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work."" People are becoming more connected through digital devices as societies become more technologically advanced, therefore the need for a large amount of privately owned cars has become moot. In Vauban, Germany, Hadrian Walter, a media trainer and mother, claims, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". Commoners, such as Mrs. Walter, are responding positively to the laws of the experimental district of Vauban, which has very few areas and opportunities for cars. In fact, ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here"". This modern day industrial revolution is drawing vast numbers of people into the areas in which cars have become a rarity.

Source 1 also states that ""Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning""."" The beta countries have had much success and have not seen failure yet. Although in France, ""Almost 4,000 drivers were fined... Twenty seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine"", it should not be considered a failed experiment. Of the millions of people who live in France, they only saw a small fraction of driving infractions on the day they limited driving. The long term culture shift that the world is beginning to see is certainly moving in a positive direction.

Between ISIS and the iPhone, the world has come across a variety of both positive and negative circumstances. Considering all the positive effects of limitations of cars, including but not limited to less traffic, a decrease in pollution, and long term culture shifts, there have been many advantages to the switch to a carefree environment. Even though transportation may take longer, it will be safer and better for the environment. Not everyone country can guarantee that all of their citizens will abide by the new laws, as shown in France, but a small fraction of the trouble is better than the mass population of millions, and in some places billions, wrecking havoc on the planet.",0
1651,"Swimming in the ocean, getting a tan, boating, and fishing are all exciting activities for the summer; in contrast, a school project is not, especially one without clear instructions.

A school project that is completely student designed is unfathomable for many Elementary, Middle, or High School students because of the stress it would create during a time of recovery.

Many teachers give summer assignments, but allow for students to do the Bork, that beys required to be completed over the summer, during the school year.

Although projects with specific instructions by the teacher can be tedious, many could argue that coming up with a rubric for one's self would be of greater difficulty.

In the event that schools make summer projects mandatory, it is the responsibility of teachers to make sure students learn necessary information and achieve the goals of the project.

Teachers should design the summer project for students because no teacher bands to grade abstract projects and no student bands to strive for individuality been out of contact with classmates, for been students are on summer break many do not have the ability so see if they are doing the same project, accidentally, as others.

A psychology teacher conducts a final exam each year in the form of a project in which students choose a topic and are not given instructions besides to relate it to psychology; consequently, she has found this project to be a hassle more than an excitement for both her and some of her students.

The process of completing a project goes smoother been given rules to follow and, within those rules, allowing students to express themselves even more than that of a guideline free project.

For anyone to learn about a topic through the creation of a project, there must be guidelines in order to research and learn the information needed for the class in which the project is for.

Clear instructions provide students with the information required to obtain a passing score and to also give information needed to pass classes of the next school year.

When completing homework or classwork in which students must research to learn that the next unit bill entail allows students a chance to learn more than that is required and provides students the ability to learn even before the information is taught.

Many students would jump at the opportunity to get ahead on the information for the next school year and many may not enjoy the requirement, but appreciate the opportunity.

Giving clear instructions provides the structure to learn and get ahead before the race for grades begins.

A summer project in which the students are designing and planning does not insure they bill continue to learn during their break, but instead assures teachers that students bill attempt to make it as non-complex and superficial for themselves as possible.

Providing students with the opportunity to design their project uniquely with no specifications needed enables them to be lazy in the creation of the project and miss critical information for the subject that the project is on.

Students come up with many bays to avoid in depth descriptions of a topic because of the lack of motivation to do so.

With clear instructions, students bill be able to find the information the teacher bands and needs in order to grade the project, and the information needed to elaborate on this knowledge in the beginning of the school year.

Students band the ability to enjoy the summer and with the specific necessities for the summer project highlighted, they bill not have the stress of creating a project from scratch.

Many people have found student designed projects to be more time-consuming, although less tedious, and bill overall take away from the main purpose of summer vacation which is to recover from the stress induced during the school year.

It takes time to plan a student designed project and many are not given the time needed because of family vacations and summer jobs to account for.

Summer assignments are difficult to complete no matter the type, but an all encompassing, nonspecific project would be found a stressor many would not fish to endure.

To conclude, summer is a time for rejuvenation and recuperation; therefore, requiring an abstract project during this time is inadequate to the idea that many students are unable to complete such a task based on prior engagements, no structural support to aid in finding information needed, and upholding the sole purpose of summer.

Students do not band the stress of the school year carried over into the summer and neither do teachers, for students may find the need to contact teachers about that they can and cannot do if there is not a rubric they are able to follow.",0
1652,"Have you ever wondered what are some true dangers of exploring Venus? Venus is a broiling hot planet due to it being the second-farthest planet from the Sun, which is our closest star.

Scientists have created multiple technological devices, but have they created enough for them to explore planets, such as Venus. Did you know people say Venus is a female planet?

In case the reader has not yet figured it out, this essay is about the planet in our solar system known as Venus.

Venus has a bad reputation and for a pretty good reason. No spaceship has ever landed there, neither has a spacecraft and survived for more than a few hours. This is because of the toxic gases that surround Venus. It's been three decades, thirty years, since scientists attempted to try to land another spaceship on Venus. This is because those toxic gases that surround Venus are ninety-seven percent of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acids, which is deadly for any living organisms' lungs from planet Earth. Planet Venus's toxic atmosphere makes it difficult for us humans to explore Venus.

Venus has many other dangers to explore this planet as well. Weather, Natural Disasters beyond what Earth's people have ever seen, heat, and it's atmospheric pressure. Venus may be farther away from the Sun by Mercury is the first closest planet to the Sun and is cooler than Venus. Venus's average temperature is over eight-hundred degrees Fahrenheit. Venus has the hottest surface temperature than any other planet in our entire solar system. Venus has an atmospheric pressure that is ninety times greater than what we experience on Earth, our home planet. Venusian geology shows Venus has natural disasters including erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequently occurring lighting strikes. The lighting could easily get to Venus's surface.

Venus has many other dangers to explore this planet as well. Weather, Natural Disasters beyond what Earth's people have ever seen, heat, and it's atmospheric pressure.

Venus has an atmospheric pressure that is ninety times greater than what we experience on Earth, our home planet. Venusian geology shows Venus has natural disasters including erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequently occurring lighting strikes. The lighting could easily get to Venus's surface.

Despite these life-threatening dangers for scientists, it would amaze to explore Venus because it is something no human has ever done before. 1st sentence. It would be a worthy pursuit for sure. It would also be a lot of hard work just to discover how any human would be able to survive landing on Venus to explore it. Furthermore, it would be amazing as well-to-do something like this because future generations of people would know if they believe and work hard enough that they can do anything they set their mind to do. Anything is possible.

This essay was on Venus, a very dangerous planet. Venus is a dangerous planet because Venus is toxic. Venus is also full of hot weather and natural disasters. Those natural disasters are much more extreme than anything Earth has experienced or the people on Earth has and will ever see. Mercury is even cooler than Venus and Mercury is even closer to the Sun. Venus is a dangerous planet, but it would be well worth being able to finally explore.  ",0
1653,"The technology we have today allows us to create new ideas that can change our world. Driverless cars is an idea that is a part of the modern age of technology. In the article, the author elaborates on many ways driverless cars have become a reality in our world today. The technology that allows us to create new ways to keep the roads safe helps our world become a better place.

Every year thousands of people die or get injured because of car crashes. Driverless cars can help put an end to the tragic deaths caused by these crashes. In the second paragraph, the author points out that Google's independently driven cars have driven more than half a million miles without crashing. Cameras and sensors in cars watch the road and the driver ensuring that the people in the car and the people in the car's surrounding are safe. If everyone has the opportunity to drive one of these cars, then crashes will be reduces significantly.

Not only does the new technology in the cars have the ability to stop crashes, they allow the car transit information to the people inside the car in case there is a malfunction. In 2013, BMW announced the start of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". Although the program does not make cars completely driverless, it shows that we are coming closer to creating cars with the ability to make driving safer. BMW's ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" has special touch sensors that makes sure the driver has his or her hand on the steering wheel at all times. The new technology can stern, brake and accelerate themselves, but its primary design is to notify the driver when the raid ahead needs the skills of a human driver. Some of these warning include flashing lights or windshield display that can notify the driver if the situation needs human skills.

Although, a completely driverless car is still in the future, new technologies have shown that a driverless car is safe enough to invest in. With its features keeping people focused, crashes caused by texting, sleeping, or even drunk driving will decrease. Also, the amount of people speeding will drop resulting in less tickets and overall safer rods that everyone can drive on without the fear of getting in a car crash.",0
1654,"""Do voters really control whom their elector picks for""(9)we should switch to a direct voting system. With electoral college going voters don't always have control on whom the electors from their state pick. In some instances the electoral voters vote is more valued than the peoples vote. Over 60% of voters would prefer a direct vote not an electoral vote.

The electoral vote weighs more than the popular vote, this in Unfair because if a mass of people vote for one president and a few electoral voters choose the other president the people don't get the president they wanted, the electoral voters do. So we could expect that a popular vote winner CLSID yet again lose presidency to the electoral vote. BST electoral votes balance OST the states say in the vote, if a big state all votes against a small state the big one will win the electoral college balances that, BST the popular vote is everyone's say not a couple of peoples say.

60% of voters would prefer a direct vote. A direct vote would give the people more voice in the election instead of the few in the electoral college. If we abolish the electoral college the popular vote will be the main vote counted and there will be not more electoral college. Using a direct voting system the people will get the president that they want and voted for(ex. Al Gore)

If the electoral vote goes to a tie then it goes to the house of representatives and there each state has one representative, that one person is voting for thousands of people. That one representative can go against their states wishes and vote for whom ever they choose, So this could lead to bribing the rep into voting for someone else. So the popular vote doesn't help the president get selected.

This is why we should switch to a direct voting system. So the people have more say in who gets to be their president for the next for years. The popular vote cannot be bribed or altered. And the popular vote is everyone's vote, not a few or even one person's decision.  ",0

Today, TRE majority of humans own and operate cell prone son a daily basis. A lot of things in TRE 21st century rave to do with using a cell prone, including driving. Although some people may agree with using a cell prone while driving, others may disagree. Trey all rave their own reasons wry, but I'm going to explain wry drivers should be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Trier are lots of benefits wren using a cell prone while operating a vehicle, but TRE most important benefit of cell phones during driving is TRE security factor. During emergency situations' cell prone scan provide help and TRE driver can make emergency calls, even reporting any dangerous scenario such as roadside accidents. Through cell phones a driver can locate TRE desired route or find RIS/RER way back Rome if trey are lost. Using FMs on cell prone scan also provide information about weather and traffic.

Regulating cell prone use is not a federal responsibility, even on federal roads. This is not an issue that Washington RAS TRE authority to address. Trier's no compelling reason for it. TRE National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says that 3,092 traffic deaths last year involved distracted drivers. But using a cell prone is only one of many driver distractions. Eating and drinking while behind TRE wheel are two others, and trey are far more dangerous Tran yapping on TRE prone. In fact, a 2009 NHTSA study found that 80% of all car wrecks are caused by drivers eating or drinking, not cellphone use, with coffee guzzling TRE top offender.

According to federal data, traffic deaths rave fallen from 2.1 per 100 million vehicle miles in 1990, wren virtually no one rad a cellphone, to 1.1 in 2009, wren almost everyone does. We rave no problem with bans on texting while in TRE driver's seat. Texting forces a driver's eyes off TRE road and is clearly risky. But it must be done at TRE state level. That's row federalism works. States that don't see texting as a threat on their roads are free to keep it legal.

But banning cellphone use? Wry aren't TRE Potomac nannies going after Starbucks sippers and Big Mac punchers instead? Wry not prosecute women who put on their makeup while on TRE road and men who save? Shouldn't combing while driving be outlawed as well? This is all coming, of course, from TRE same Washington that's commanding automakers to build more fuel efficient cars, CRICR is likely to result, as it RAS in TRE past, in more carnage as TRE cars rave to be smaller and lighter to meet TRE standards. If federal meddlers really wanted to keep traffic fatalities down, trey'd reverse their fuel efficiency demands.

For only the electors choose who is going to be the new President, I say we get dispose of it and change the election to most popular vote! Shat way we also have a say on who is going to be the new President and the new Vice President. For we also have to have a say on this.

She think that is wrong with this system is that the voters do not vote for the President, but for the slate of the electors who in turn elect the President! Like it says on source 2 paragraph 10 ""If you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry

She Electoral College does not let us, the people, choose who is going to be the new President it only allows the electors choose who it's going to be by their vote! For an example on the 2000 U.S. Presidential race, Al Gore received more of the individual votes than George W.

Some people have good decision is because they confidently with own life?

people who make good decision is becuase they cofidently with own life and experience when they are young.

some people when they are young have good decision becuase they think first to have one or two decision or they ask they perant from what opinion for that decision they have.

Example: When we are young we make good decision for future but with the advice of the parent.

They have lesson for make good decision for have good life?

because people have many lesson for they future and they life but they have one counselor for they can talk any day they can go with counselor to they can make good decision or thye can talk about life or problem.

There are a couple of car free cities;for example German Suburbs is car free because of expensive fees they would have to pay just to have a space to park in, .""but there are only two places to park large garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a space, for $40,000,along with a home."" These families would have to spend $40,000 along just to park their car in a large garage, it makes it easy for them to make the decision not to own a car because prices are so high. Having to buy a parking space for that much and still having to buy a home along with the $40,000 can cause a lot of stress on family providers because they have to basically spend all their money on one high-priced item;a CAR!

You can become much happier without a car knowing that you don't have to spend all your money on this one item that could break down on you at anything,""As a result,70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."". For example, this mother of two is much happier without owning a car,""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" The mother of two became much happier because she no longer had to pay these high fines, fees,gas prices, and car notes that others had to pay for. It was other was to get around that you didn't have to bother coming out of pocket for such as,""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday. This was a big help to limiting car usage.

Studies show that the percentage of driving has dropped tremendously from 2005 to 2013.

President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled."" Fewer cars were seen on the roads driving,""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" It caused people to not drive their cars and take public transportation or not go anywhere at all. It got to the point where""cash strapped Americans could not afford new cars.""

Some advantages to limiting car usage are just what us as Americans want/need to hear because it's really expensive. It's not just about buying a car and running it off of air;your car takes gas, car notes, needs servicing every once in a while it's not easy owning a car. Studies show how much the driving percentage dropped keeps dropping because of high expensive prices that we have to pay to own a car.  ",0
1660,"Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble, or do they unfairly interfere young people's lives?

In my opinion yes curfews have to take care of them, it does matter if they are young, Also if they are in the night. This is a good intention from curfews, to protect them at the end the only beneficiaries are the teenagers.

For example if they are in the middle of the night they can get trouble, because they're going to do wherever they sent she nobody is watching them, for other part if curfews say not they have to respect the rules.

Otherwise nobody is in the street playing or doing something good in the night, all people are in home resting or Sith their family doing other things, they have to apply the same for teenagers.

Also in the night someone can steal your properties, or doing something bad to someone or to you, shy? To you because maybe you are match shat others are doing to someone, and you try to help or do something.

Some people thing that have fun in the night is good idea. But is not, for examples going to the clubs is not good in my opinion, because you don't anybody, or something can happen, for example in Las Vegas almost 3 years ago someone shooting a club in the middle of the night many people die. In conclusion curfews have to take care of the teenagers this is good for them.",0
1661,"""Distracted Driving is a Nāga""

In a recent Gaggle search, it was estimated that about ""1.2 billion people drive in the world"". Imagine if every driver had a cell fine, and used it while driving, this would cause a lat AF distractions and possible deadly accidents. It is my belief that people should Nat be able ta use cell fans in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Today's generation is really the mast tech-savvy because new people trying ta use their fine while driving, and it is very dangerous. Teens are very distracted by their fine and when they get a call art ext they try ta pick it up while driving that's why people need hand free Bluetooth in their car. According ta Entrance, ""cognitive AR mental distraction is when a driver's mind isn't focused a driving. Talking ta another passenger AR being preoccupied with personal, family, AR correlated issues are same examples."" Teens would rather make Snapchat ideas then driving. While you drive put your fine a the Nat disturb while you drive AR you put an manual SA it knows that you driving.

Secondly, you can also can get in a deadly accident while trying ta text and drive. According ta an USA Today article,"" In Austin, the driver AF a pickup truck that collided with a church minibus in rural Texas, killing 13 people, apologized after the crash and acknowledged he had been texting while driving."" People Dan't know haw dangerous it is far you text and drive, until it's TAA late.

In a recent gaggle search, it has been ""1.6 bill an crashes each year by texting and driving"". These are scary numbers!

Although, they made a new law that people in Georgia can't have their fans in their hands while driving. According ta Alive, ""Georgia's hands-free law talk effect a Sunday, July 1, 2018. It is a sweeping, landmark measure that has been under consideration far several years and will affect all AF us as Georgians in ANE way AR another."" People can't send AR watch a video while driving. The hand free law is all aver Georgia and they trying ta spread it around the world SA people had their fine at all. Even though the law is in place, I see an daily, drivers still using their fans.

In the end, people shouldn't use their fans while driving because it is Nat safe far people around the world. The law keeps the people safe, and it is up ta us ta enforce and fallow the laws ta keep all drivers and passengers safe and the road.  ",0
1662,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" I think it's not good to have a TV in the car because it's a distraction to the driver. If you have kids they might be laughing, screaming and doing other stuff that can distract you been driving. It is helpful for the car to be able to drive while the parent is taking care of their kids. It's okay to have Google Maps and stuff like that to help you out.

Sensors are good because they could help you out been you're not paying attention or been something is coming and you don't see it coming. They can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine which can allow the car to slob down quickly.

BMW announced the development of Traffic Jam Assistant the car can handle functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the river keeps hold of the wheel. None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless, they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but they are designed to notify the driver been the road ahead requires human skills.

Some manufactures hope to do that by bringing Inca entertainment and information systems that use heads up displays. Which can be turned off instantly been the driver needs to take over. In this bay, the Inca system is actually a safety feature.

Driving labs are focus on keeping the driver, passengers, and pedestrians safe. If be had this then, I think that it bill help us out. The reason for this is that be Boulder be focused on reading our texts, or anything like that. We knob that our car can drive on its on.

I think it would be smart to have this in our car. It would help us out in the long run. It would keep the other drivers safe if be didn't have to sorry so much about everything.",0
1663,"Dear Principle,

Hello, my name is STUDENT_NAME and I would like to discuss a policy about cell phones that I heard you were considering.

I personally think that policy 1, the one when kids are allowed to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch and free periods but must be turned off during class, is the right one.

One reason why I think that this policy is the right one is because kids should have cell phones.

It's a great way to communicate with your friends and family.

But if you are going to install this rule, there must be some limits. Kids should turn their cell phones off during class because it could distract the teacher, the class, and the person him/herself. If a teacher sees a kid playing with a cell phone or if it goes off in class, the teacher should take it away. But another good reason to have cell phones is if the school has a fire or another emergency.

Kids could easily get in touch with their parents to let the know that they are all right. Also, another thing not a lot of people think about that could be good or bad is homework.

Kids could text each other to find out what the homework is if they don't have it, but they could also send texts or pictures of the answers.

A reason that I would question about: what about teachers?

Would teachers be allowed to have their phones out whenever they wanted?

Or can they only have them out if they have some free time?

This is all something that could impact the education of the kids, but I'll let you decide that one.

One more reason kids would love to have their cell phones in school is that they can take pictures of their friends in school if there was an unforgettable moment or something like a cool memory to capture.

There are numerous reasons good or bad to install the rule about cell phones, but I hope that you will consider this letter in your deciding.",0

1665,"The thrilling concept of touching the stars has always been an endeavour man has striven to accomplish; to understand our world and universe, to reach heights that were once only dreamed of. The author of this article has a similar view. He believes we should do what we can to explore and study the planets and stars, but one planet in particular, Venus. Venus seems a likely choice for many reasons, despite the danger, he provides options of safety, also it's the most practical because it's the closest and quite similar to earth, not only that, but Venus remains a mystery and provides an exciting chalenge that must be overcome. With all this and more the author fully supports his idea that ""the challenge of exploring Venus"" is a worthy one.

First of all, the author acknowledges the fact that it is a dangerous, and quite daunting task. As he says in paragraph 2, ""No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"".

He fully understands that there will be risk, proving to the reader that this isn't simply a wild idea he just came up with, but that he has done his research and grasps the fact that it won't be easy. Moreover, he furthers his argument by putting forth ideas to increase safety. He mentions experiments and tests that have provided scientists with information to produce electronics and materials able to last longer on Venus's inhospitable surface conditions. These advances will allow scientists to conduct research in order to better understand this mysterious planet.

However, despite any time setbacks concerning development of suitable equipment, Venus has many more practical for our ventures. Venus is- at times- the closest planet in our solar system. Proximity is extremly important where space travel is concerned. It is much more reasonable that we would study and explore a planet that is relativelyl easy to get to. Not only this, but Venus is rather similar to earth. In fact as the article states ""it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"". As a reuslt it has sparked much interest and fascination for many Astronomers.

In addition to this, Venus proposes a challenge unlike any other. This is a planet that will not divulge its secrets easily, as is extremely difficult to examine. We mus strive to meet this challenge head-on, to learn all we can about this mysterious, Earth-like planet. The author concludes with a compelling argument that gives his claim more of an edge, he says, "" our travels on Earth and beyond ...should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagintion and innovation"". Humans will be met with challenge after challenge and we cannot scatter at the idea of danger, but rather stand firm and face these difficulties that will lead us to even greater heights.

While this article may have a few faults, the author inspires and excites the minds of curious adventurers who seek reach beyond any limits. He provides reason mixed with ideas that appeal to a readers sense of emotion and supports his claim to a point that they are willing to rise up and meet this challenge like none other. Mankind is faced with this endeavour to seek out and overcome the danger of his proposal, to let their dreams of reaching the stars, become reality.",0
1666,"Should we keep the Electoral college, or take Vt away for popularity vote? Well, the Electoral College Vs a process which they cannot hold office, but can help the presidents votes. A popularity vote Vs which we the citizens of the United States vote on whom we would like the president to be. The Electoral College helps vote for the president of the United States because there Vs a certainty of the outcome, and the Electoral College are like presidents too. I support the Idea of which keeping the Electoral College for the help VN the presidential run.

Keeping the Electoral College Vs vital to the presidents because there Vs a certainty of the outcome. Richard A. Poster states: ""The reason Vs that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College Invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" This means that the Electoral College votes count more than the popularity votes for the upcoming president. For example, Richard A. Poster states that ""Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney..."" This means that the Electoral College votes are way more accounted for then the popular votes.

Aren't Electoral Colleges like presidents too? They help the presidents votes and help them make decisions also. Doesn't that sound like a president to you? The article states ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregVonal appeal."" says Richard A. Poster. This means that Electoral Colleges' no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The president elect Electoral Colleges to be VN there favor.

1667,"Phones and driving

Phones and driving is where you text, call, or use your phone in any way. It's very dangerous, and I think people should not be able to do it to keep them safe and the other people around them safe as well. Many things can happen when being distracted from driving such as a little crash as a bump to a car or can be as serious as hitting someone or injuring yourself it can also lead to your or even someone else death.

In most cases' people from the age 1833 admitted to using the phone while driving about 59% of them. They say the reason they do this is that they feel as if they are safe and won't crash, but some of them have admitted that they have been involved in an accident.

Some people feel as if sending a simple text won't do any harm, so it's fine to respond or if someone is calling they should pick it up rather than let it ring.

Using your phone while driving is a very dangerous thing to do because it can cause a lot of damage and can make some people pay lots of money. Some people don't realize how bad it is to do these things because the people who do it are the ones who have been involved in an accident.

There are many consequences some can be $20$500 but if you kill or harm others than if you can be jail or prison time all the way up to life in prison one thing that can happen is you can kill yourself doing this or kill a kid who could grow up to be the president or the person to find the cure for cancer or just a very important person. Using you phone might not get you killed, but it can get others killed.

In conclusion using your phone for any reason isn't worth it because not only are you in danger but others as well. If I were you I wouldn't use your phone because even if you don't get caught that means you'll do it again and the next time you do than that could be the time you get hurt or killed. Nhat I think new could do to keep this from happening is putting cameras around the roads to see who uses their phone and write them a ticket and or fine them.  ",0
1668,"The conspiracy about aliens has been starting to go too far. An isolated mesa was found on Mars, BMT when its picture was taken, it looked like a face. The conspiracy theorists have been thinking that that's the proof that there's life on Mars, BMT they're wrong. The picture was taken in 2001, which means it was very detailed, so it would've been obvious if there were any tombs or buildings surrounding the mesa. Also, it only looks like a face became of it shadows. The shadows actually shape it into a face. Finally, if it was actually a sign for alien life, it would've profited NASA, so there wouldn't be a point in hiding the ""truth"" that the conspiracy theorists believe. These all show that the Face is just an ordinary rock.

The last picture of the Face was taken in 2001. This was a very detailed picture, even for being taken so long ago. Each pixel in the image was equal to 1.56 meters in real life. This means that any other nearby buildings or tombs would've been seen near the rock. There weren't any buildings or any sign of actual alien life nearby, so the picture at least proved that the Face wasn't a sign from the aliens, BMT just a rock.

The only reason that the Face looks so much like a face is became of the shadows. Without the shadows, the Face might just look like an ordinary rock on Mars. The shadows themselves give the illusion of the rock having eyes, a nose, and a month. Those shadows are the only reason that the Face IS

The Face.

Without those shadows, the Face wouldn't be so famous. Nobody would have probably ever known or cared about it.

The conspiracy theorists and many people in general probably think that NASA is hiding the fact that aliens are real, so they're lying about the Face and just saying that it's a landform, when they think it's a sign that aliens exist. That's not time. NASA is a company that needs money like all the rest. They know that telling people that aliens were real would profit them a lot, so they wouldn't just hide the fact that the Face was an alien artifact if it was one. NASA probably wishes that they had found an ancient civilization on Mars, just for the profit.

The theorists are wrong about the Face being an ancient artifact. The latest picture of the Face is so detailed, that any ancient civilizations nearby would be visible. Also, the Face is only the Face became the rock has shadows along it that makes it look like it has eyes, a nose, and a month. Finally, NASA would probably like to find an ancient civilization on Mars, just so that they could profit from finding something related to alien life. They wouldn't just hide the truth if they could gain money from it. Therefore, theorists should just realize that facts are facts, and that if NASA finds an ancient civilization on Mars, they'll tell everyone.",0
1669,"Many cities and countries are starting a new trend that is not using cars at all. Vehicles can cause many problems such as air pollution, congested roads, and injuries due to wrecks. Some cities have started some type of way to promote how bad vehicles really are and advising people on what to do to stop driving.

For three years in Bogota, Colubia, the city has a day called, ""Day Without Cars"" where in this city, home of seven million citizens, nobody can use a vehicle unless they are willing to pay a $25 fee if they were get caught. Columbians greatly support this cause by hiking, biking, skating, and taking the bus to work. This caused the roads to be clear and not congested like they usually are.

Paris has a system to help support limiting car use as well. They take even and odd numbered license plates and designate a day that's either even or odd. On the even day, car owners that have an even license plate are ordered to leave their car at home, and vice versa for odd. If they have drive their car on the day they were ordered to leave it home, they have to pay a fee of $31.

The United States has reached a point to where cars are starting to become unpopular. In 2005, the amount of miles driven peaked, and in April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was down approximately 9% below the peak in 2005. That is eqaul to where the U.S. was in 1995.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that some companies that are in the computer/cell phone business are making more money. In the United States, many people are using the computer and telephone to communicate with people because it's faster and easier to access than having to drive around town to meet with someone. This means that computer websites are making more money and the phone companies are making more money since people are using their phones more often.

Next, cars can cause major stress to some people. Traffic jams, animals running across the road, not being able to see due to smog, and car accidents stress people out because they are either too busy to deal with it or being scared that they might hurt someone/something or may even get hurt themselves. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter in an article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal.

Also people's health could improve tremendously as a result of limiting car usage. Walking to work could burn the calories that people ate at breakfast. Hiking, running, skating, and biking to meet up for lunch or for little kids to go to the play ground could greatly increase people's health. Since people would be technically exercising while going to places, they would be more proned to drinking water to rehydrate themselves which would make them a healthier person in the process as well.

The process of limiting car usage has started or has already taken over cities and countries. It can reduce stress, increase the health of people, and increase the profit for business. The advantages of limiting car usage may seem small, but in the end they will have a huge impact on societies.    ",0
1670,"Cellphones has already taken place of your calendar don't let him take place of your family. Some people think cell phones should be allowed in school but other says it is just destruction. Cell phones shouldn't be allowed in school because it is destruction,increase cheating, and less use of dictionary.

Firstly, cell phone is destruction. For example the one person I know was always on her phone. Moreover as her phone vibrate she just open the phone and start checking messages. As result she was not distracting herself but also class and teacher. Later on due to this habit she couldn't pass SOL.Because phone was destruction for her. Last year one of my friend didn,t uses much phone in the first quarter she got really good grade. Furthermore in second quarter she starting using cell phones more. Moreover in school she do all her work in rush so that she could have more time for cell phones. As a result her grade starting getting worst she ended up felling her both SOL.In her first quarter she has six A and one B but in fourth quarter she have five A,one B ,and one D.Furthermore one of person couldn't pass SOL and grades also go really worst.

Secondly,cell phones is not only destruction but also increases cheating. For example one of my friend whenever give test she take picture and send question to other student. The teacher make same test for both classes. Furthermore she can help them by giving them answers in test but in SOL

she couldn't help them. As a result they will end up might be felling SOL.Moreover one of person was giving a final exam in school she was also texting one of her friend all the answers and the answers she didn't know she was also using Google for them. Most of the question was about vocabulary she was just searching vocabulary and writing on final exam. Cell phones are not only increasing cheating but also student thinks they are helping others which is wrong. The both person was doing wrong one of them was sending question to her friends other was searching from Google.

Thirdly,cell phones is destruction,moreover increase cheating furthermore there is less use of dictionary. For example one of my friend prefer searching from phone rather than using dictionary. The main reason for using cellphones instead of dictionary was because from dictionary you have to find a word it take more time than cell phones. Furthermore in cell phones you just have to type a word and cell phones will give you meaning ,and synonyms. Moreover one of my friend always uses phone for searching a word meaning she never use paper dictionary but in SOL they didn't allow you to use phone. As a result she struggle using paper dictionary. People want easy way to do things that is why they uses cell phones instead of using dictionary.

In conclusion, some people think cell phones are helpful in education but other thinks it is destruction. Cell phones are not helpful in education because it is destruction for students,increase cheating,and less use of dictionary .Students are keep checking on their phone. Cell phones is also increasing cheating student text test question to each other also can search from Google. Cell phones are also taking away people paper dictionary from student , student really struggle when they go for testing and cell phones are not allowed. Cell phones are like drugs to youth they are getting addictive to it.                               ",0
1671,"Cars are everywhere these days, and they are commonplace among us. Getting From point a to point i almost always involves using a car. Iut there is a different method of transportation emerging and that is public transportation. There are many benefits to public transportation including reducing emissions, having less cars on the road, and improving cities. This one Farfetched idea is now coming into the spotlight.

In cities like Chicago and New York, the skies are dark and gloomy and pollution is in the air. The main contributing source come From emissions From cars. Limiting the usage of cars would help to clear the skies and stop some pollution From Killing the air. The quality of life would then i.e. much better in these cities. ""after days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving IAN to clear the air of the global city."" Paris needed to IAN cars because the smog and pollution in the city was getting out of hand. IU there were Fewer cars in the city, this type of problem would never i.e. an issue here or around the world.

traffic is always an big issue on the roads around the United States and the world. Limiting car usage would ease the traffic and make roads a lot safer. When the car IAN was in place in Paris ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after Sideways of intensifying smog."" when fewer cars were out on the road, accidents would i.e. greatly reduced and city highways like the ones in Chicago, Illinois would i.e. much more manageable. There would i.e. more money to work on roads since the traffic is reduced and the roads would also stay in prestige condition For longer amounts of time. Events like Carrie day have already had big impacts in other parts of the world and the impact would i.e. even greater in larger countries such as the United States. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" having less cars on the road would benefit our society in more ways than one.

Quite an New years ago, ideas such as public transportation becoming mainstream seemed pretty Farfetched. Well today, those ideas can help businesses and whole towns limit car usage. When cars are used less Frequently, the areas that have more Frequent usage will i.e. cared For even more. New sidewalks, restaurants, and shopping will emerge throughout cities and i.e. a huge advantage. Caring For roads have little benefit and putting money into public areas will help out cities tremendously. ""Parks and sports centers also have loomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced in road, smooth sidewalks. New restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" using public transportation in staid of cars will greatly improve cities.

Cars have been around For a long time and have served us For many years. Now, reducing or getting rid of them seems like a viable option because emissions will i.e. reduced, there will i.e. fewer cars on the road, and cities would i.e. improved. This task of getting rid of cars may seem hard to do but the infrastructure For it is already in place. Puilic transportation is already in larger cities such as New York and Chicago, and it can easily i.e. installed in smaller towns and communities. The advantages such as less pollution and more greatly outweigh the minor inconveniences. Smart planning is the best option to encompass all of these ideas. "" It separates suburban life From auto use, as a component of a movement called smart planning."" smart planning is not only the wisest opportunities and advantages of limiting car usage For now, it is also meant to help Future generations have a safer and cleaner world to live in.",0
1672,"Elisabeth Rosenthal once asked, ""Has America passed peak driving?"", (30) having people go out of their way to think about the incurable question. There are plenty of advantages of limiting car usage. America, nor any other country on this planet, really need cars. Sure, cars help us to get to a location faster than walking or biking. But it also smogs up the environment we live in and creates a stressful tension within you.

In Source 2, Paris, one of the world's most famous sightseeing locations on this planet, was days of near record pollution. Paris strictly enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. (10) For almost a week, there was an intensified amount of smog roaming the streets of Paris. Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France. (14) This smog was causing frigid nights and warm days the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. (15) Not only was there smog in Paris, but also rivaled one of the most polluted cities in the world, Beijing, China. Paris decided to partially cut down motorists chances of driving and leave their cars at home or would have had to suffer a fine. This well-known city was carefree for almost an entire week.

In line with Source 2, Source 3 explains multiple ways of transportation. Why drive cars and pollute the air, if there are plenty of other ways to getting to your destination. Bogotá, Colombia has set up a program that is set to spread to other countries. This program consist of having a carefree day once a year for the last 3 years, Day Without Cars day. More than 6 million of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses and taxis to work, Bogotá's streets were trafficjamfree.(20) ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza, a businessman. (24) No stress was within the city of Bogotá that day. Their goal is to promote better transportation and reduce smog. (21)

Enrique's hiera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay, noticed the enthusiastic changes being made and said, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders."" (26) Fellow citizens, there are several advantages of limiting car usage. Maybe the next time you think about going somewhere, try taking a bike or walking. It's easier and reliefs stress among yourself. Plus, when not driving a car, you're able to decrease the amount of pollution being put into the air.",0
1673,"In 1976 a NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was going around Mars looking and taking pictures of places where Viking 2 could land. It spotted a shadow that looked like a human face. It was a huge head about 2 Miles from one end to the other end. The face looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Some scientists figured out it was just an ESA, but people started thinking it could be proof that aliens were real. They then started Making Movies of the face and Magazines and stuff like that because they believed aliens had created the face.

NASA already knew it was just a cocoon ESA. NASA and the scientists already knew it was an ESA, but it looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. As soon as they showed the public the picture people started believing that it could be evidence that aliens created that and are living. Kollywood started Making Movies, books, and a lot of other stuff. Scientists wanted to be sure that it was just an ESA, so NASA then sent another spacecraft. They took another picture and saw that it looked nothing like the first picture. They had to send another spacecraft in 2001 just to Make sure it wasn't an Mistake and to see which one was correct. The picture looked different too but looked so Ouch better so NASA and scientists told the public it was an ESA.

The face in Mars was just a natural landform. The same thing basically happens around Western America. A guy, Gavin, said that the face reminds his of Middle Butte in Idaho. Ke said, ""That's a lava done that takes the for of an isolated ESA about the same height at the face on Mars."" The first picture they took in 1976 of the face really looks like not a natural landform. As the cameras got More better, in 1998, the face kind of still had the face shape, but it looked More flat. The picture in 2001 just Made the face look just like a natural landform. The 2001 picture, which is the latest one, shows no proof of living things in Oars. The face looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh in the first picture they took. The latest picture, in 2001, the face looked like a butte or ESA. The face was just a natural landform like the landforms that happen in Western America. If it was proof that there is living things in Mars, it would be beneficial for both taxpayers and NASA. Kopefully they'll go again soon and take pictures to confirm if it was a natural landform, or it's really proof that there is living things in Oars, but I don't think they're going to go again because a lot of people now believe it was just a natural landform.

At last, the face was just a natural landform and was not Made by aliens. The face did really look like it was created because that's what the people in ancient times basically did, but it was just a landform. The picture first picture was really cool not going to lie, and I thought it was created by a living thing but when I saw the recent pictures it just started to look like a natural landform. Maybe they'll find More evidence and confirm if it was just a natural landform or if it was created by aliens, who knows.  ",0

Allowing students to access their education remotely mat offer them benefit, BT making school a more manageable part of their lives, creating convenience, and taking away unnecessary pressure and stress.

In their catboat lives, teens are occupied with a multitude of responsibilities: school, work, sports, and extracurriculars.

Its mat be difficult for some students to manage all of these in the strict time constraints of a conventional school setting.

In order to make it through a full that of school, the mat have to wake up extra early for a practice, or miss out on sleep after coming home late from their job.

The would no longer have obligatory school hours, which would allow them more freedom to work according to an agenda that suits their own needs.

Online schooling also presents convenience for some students: those who are unable to attend school on a regular basis, or those who don't possess the learning style to which the teachers cater.

These students begin to miss out on valuable class time and fall behind on the curriculum, which puts them at a disadvantage.

An option for distance learning mat allow them to have a more comfortable setting for learning at home and ensure the can stat up to speed while not having to physically be in the classroom. In addition, some classes unavailable through the school mat be accessible online, which could allow students to explore more subjects that interest them. This could eventually encourage them to make a more informed decision about what the want to pursue later in life.

Students can face a number of different pressures in a school setting, whether the be academic or social, which create undue stress.

It would alleviate these negative stressors to make distance learning a realistic option for all students.

Oftentimes, many teens pursue more rigorous classes in order to be in good standing for college admissions. However, this mentality prevents students from exploring other options that mat not be down the beaten path.

Allowing students the ability to take some courses online mat encourage them to decrease their in school course load, and take on a more manageable set of classes.

In addition, online classes mat also allow those who wish to distance themselves from the social aspect of school to have a more enjoyable learning experience free from distraction.

Although online school is still, in part, a novel concept, it should not be approached with apprehension, as the opportunities it presents to students provide them with a number of benefits that cannot be overlooked.

It allows students to adopt a more responsible and independent role in their education, and encourages them to take initiative and work at a pace suitable for them.

Overall, online school offers the option for a more relaxed and low pressure environment that is important for today's overworked students.",0
1675,"Dear, senator

I think you should vote on abolishing the Electoral College because it's obviously dumb.

First, they can be anybody which I believe is just wrong It should be somebody who wants to be in it and works hard to do so.

Secondly, it makes zero since whatsoever that bigger states get more electoral votes because it's not fair to the other people in the state who want the other guy to win, but that doesn't matter if it's the winner takes all system. Winner takes all system make no since at all either. You shouldn't go by that if it's not what the people want. For example, in the year 2000 Gore won the popular vote or the vote the people wanted, and Bush lost. But since Bush won the electoral vote he became the president.

So what you are trying to say is that the peoples vote doesn't count when choosing the person that will help run this country? That is terrible! Instead of going by how big the state is and how many electoral votes they get it should be the popular vote or the peoples vote!

Sincerely,

1676,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes the new facial recognition technology called the Facial Action Coding System(FACS). This system claims to read emotion expressions. I think that the FACS could help since in understanding the emotions and muscle relationship and think it is a valuable thing in classrooms.

Some positive thing about the new technology are adaptation and improvement. With this new technology we can use it to adapt different things like ads and school lessons. Ads can sometimes completely take out the interest on the viewers for the video and can be sometimes unpredictable. This has happened numerous times in classrooms when a teacher wants to show a documentary that is all ready slightly boring and an ad showing an exciting new superheroes' movie comes up So now you have the entire class talking about it and not paying any attention to the documentary about Charles Darwin and what he did. Having these distracting ads adapt to what the audience is feeling could help bring down the amount of times this happens. The FACS could also help in computer lesson planing. If the FACS was installed in a computer the computer would be able to realize that a student is no longer paying attention because of boredom. So system can then improve what the lesson has by changing the order around to give the student a more personalized lesson thus having the student learn easier.

There are some bad feedback as well. If the FACS system success in improving the academic scores of the students the school administration might decide that the teacher are no longer needed to teach the student, the students could just study in there computers. Another way the FACS could not be so good is that it is likely to be very expensive and there are ways a possibility it can malfunction and give unwanted changes in lessons and other sections in which it would be used.

In conclusion, I think that the FACS could be of great help in the world if it could be 100% reliable. This system could benefit the everyday use if used correctly and I think that the FACS could help since in understanding the emotions and muscle relationship. I think it is a valuable thing in classrooms.",0
1677,"Driverless cars, although fascinating and revolutionary, are not a good idea. There are many flaws about the current driverless cars that are on the road today. Humans need to operate it in order to navigate through complicated circumstances, smart roads to help solve that problem are very expensive and nonpractical, and there are many legal troubles stirred up by these vehicles. These problems are simply not worth the idea of a smart car. In my opinion, driverless cars should stay off the road.

There are many flaws that come with driverless cars. One of these flaws is the fact that the skills of a human operator are required to navigate these ""driverless cars"" through complicated situations, such as road construction or driving around an accident. In the passage ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", the author states in paragraph two, ""... Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways, or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" If a human operator has to take over the ""driverless"" car periodically, there is no point in even having a car that can drive through simple traffic with ease. One solution to the fact that a human operator must take over when facing roadwork is the idea of smart roads. Smart roads would use a cable to send radio signals to a receiver on the front of a car. The trouble is, replacing ordinary roads with these smart roads would be ""simply too expensive to be practical,"" the narrator states in paragraph three. Legal troubles involving driverless cars are a whole different issue. In paragraph nine, the author explains, ""Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer?"" Driverless cars are bound to malfunction at one point or another. New laws would have to be established in order to properly provide justice in the case of someone's injury or death. This problem is too tedious and not nearly worth the idea of a driverless car.

There are too many reasons to go against the idea of a driverless car. Human driving skills will be required and used anyway, smart roads are very expensive and nonpractical, and there are many legal troubles involving smart cars. Perhaps in twenty or so years when these problems can be efficiently solved, smart cars will be a good idea. Mut in this day and age, with these problems, driverless cars are not worth it. Smart cars should stay off the road.",0
1678,"Is it expected for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school, i say no to this because there are many students that still do not know what they want to do when they get older. For example there are students that are waiting to know forsure on what they want to do in life and it takes time to know what you want to do. Another example is there are many students that may not be able to afford college, if that is what they are planning and that is why it is hard because many students do not have enough for it, and that is why students take there time thinking what they want to do but can do so they can be successful in life.

Another reason why students do not know what they want to do by the time they enter high school, some parents want there kid to do what they want when it should not be like that, that is also why students have hard time thinking on what to do in the future. Students should have to worry about there future so they end up being successful in life, and end up doing good in life and making your parents proud on doing thins that they couldn't have.

It would help out students if he/she knew what they wanted to do in there life entering high school, so later on they don't have to worry much on what they want to do because they will already know. It gives them an advantage because they already know what they want to do and so they're going to work for it, they can change there mind if they want later on if they would like.

If you know what you want todo in life its a good thing because then you know how hard you are going to work for to get there and be successful in life. If you know what you want to do it will give you an advantage because you will be working hard to get there and achieve your goal, just be successful in life and if you don't know what to do just keep thinking about it until you know the career path yo want to choose to be successful in life.",0

1680,"It is two forty-nine, and Generic_Name has to wait only one more minute for the school day to end. He was looking forward to having his first baseball practice of the fall later that night. The bell rings, and Generic_Name begins to cheer loudly.

""Generic_Name are you excited for science club today?"" said Generic_Name, Generic_Name's best friend. Generic_Name froze, and had remembered he had science club for two hours after school today. Generic_Name began panicking, and started asking himself questions.

""Am I going to be late for practice?"" ""Will I have time to finish my homework?"" Then Mr. Generic_Name, Generic_Name's last block teacher, began to pack up his things, getting ready to leave work for the day, before Generic_Name said, ""Mr. Generic_Name, why are you leaving, isn't there yearbook club today?"" Mr. Generic_Name let out a disappointed sigh and began to unpack all of his things. This is how life would be if all students had to participate in after school activities. I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it won't provide students the time necessary to complete their homework to the best of their abilities, many students participate in sports outside of school, and teachers will have to spend more time after school directing clubs.

The first reason I disagree that all students must participate in extracurricular activities is because it won't provide students the time necessary to complete their homework to the best of their abilities. If a student participated in a club that extended their school day by two hours, that is two hours fewer that the student has to complete homework. There are some days where a student will receive homework for every subject, and if my principal took away my time do my homework, I would be furious. Also, when students don't have the time necessary to complete assignments to the best of their abilities, they race through it to complete it and risk earning a failing grade. If a student feels stressed and overwhelmed by their homework because of an after school club, they should have the choice to not participate in the club. Homework is practice for later assessments, and if the student does not have time to practice and prepare for the quiz or test, they will never learn what they need to and will not succeed on the assessment.

The second reason I disagree that all students must participate in extracurricular activities is because many students participate in sports outside of school. Some students play at a level where they are practicing several times a week. For example, if a middle school student has baseball practice at six o'clock, and their after school club ends at five, not only will they have to rush from school to practice, but may be at risk of being late. Coaches of competitive teams find it frustrating if their players are late to practice. A student can also become very exhausted from a long day at school and may not perform well with an exhausted body and mind. An athlete must also be dedicated to their sport outside of practices, which means working to get better after school. Student-athletes have to find a balance between their schoolwork and their sports, and this can be difficult if a club is being thrown into the mix as well.

The final reason I disagree that all students must participate in extracurricular activities is because teachers will have to spend more time after school directing clubs. Teachers spend hours a day grading papers outside of school, and some still struggle with completing this. The last thing a teacher wants to do is have a few hours of grading papers cut off their day so they can direct a club. If a teacher has an hour and a half less to grade papers, then that is a few hundred assignments left without a grade. These papers begin to add up, and before they know it, they have 5 stacks of assignments that are being graded at two in the morning. Not only will the teacher have to supervise the club, but they will also be tasked with planning what the members are doing at every meeting, on top of planning for what they are teaching their students throughout the normal day. A teacher is still a human, and can become stressed out by all this extra work they have to complete. All of this extra work for them takes away the valuable time they can be spending with their beloved families.

The bell rings, and Generic_Name goes soaring out of the door, to his locker, outside to the bike rack, and begins his peaceful bike ride home. He can not wait for baseball practice and to see all of his teammates again. As Generic_Name arrives home, his mom calls to him, ""I made you a smoothie, it's on the counter."" Generic_Name sits down and opens up his laptop, and begins working on his history presentation. When he was finished, he was sure that it was the best work he had ever done. A couple of hours later, Generic_Name arrives at practice, and is so enthusiastic to see his teammates. Generic_Name was thrilled to be back on the ball field! This is how a student would feel without the stress of having to participate in a club. They have time to actually perform well on homework and projects, and can enjoy their life as a kid. I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it won't provide students the time necessary to complete their homework to the best of their abilities, many students participate in sports outside of school, and teachers will have to spend more time after school directing clubs.",0

1682,"Dear TEACHER_NAME

I do no think students should be required to do community service. Whether someone helps they community is their choice. If they feel like it's a waste of time it is their opinion. It might also interfere with their schedule, some students have very packed lives. From the time they get up in the morning to the time the go-to sleep at night they are go, go, go. They barely have time for themselves in a regular week, so it would be hard for them to find them time to help out in the community. As for the people who won't help because they don't feel like it or because they want to do something else that's their choice, granted it's not a very good choice, but it is theirs. They are the ones who will have to live with the choices they made in life not you.

In addition, if you make it a requirement for us to do community service it may cause problems. Che's students that don't feel like doing it or don't have time to do it may not do it at all, and if you made community service part of our grade, and they don't do it they might start failing in school because of the grades they are not receiving due to not doing community service. Che last thing we want is kids failing in school because they don't have the time to help our community. I do think you should let community service be an exploratory option like art, technology and drama though. It will give the kids who do want to help our community a chance to do so.

Why put yourself through the stress of having to deal with children rebelling against it when you can just not do it. I hope you will choose what you think is best for our school, but I also want you to take my views into consideration and choose not to make it mandatory.",0

1684,"One topic"" success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". When the person want to progress with something the person maybe failure or maybe not, if you work hart and you focuses your goals because everybody try to do some better on his life.

I agree with Churchill' because the statement is important role not always your won when the people have a goal, each time when we try something new, we will be able to success the first time but the problems is to how your work for you not failure on your life. When you start everything is enthusiasm only you know how work going for the future you can't not failure.

Second reason, the British prime minister say that because maybe he does something, and he tries to do with different ways. The

British look at for you wan to have something good or other thing is when you start, but the first thing is when you failure because not always your won on your goals but if you want to memories your own life, you need to focus on goals and them you will have your success on life. When you get a success, your was enthusiasm.

Last reason, I see if you want to be successful on your high school or in your job you only need is believe in your self.

1685,"The Face in the picture was not created by aliens but Must a natural landform. Tons of people believe it was created by aliens. In some ways I guess it could look like it was created by them. But in the end it was Must a natural landform. A great deal of scientists strongly believe that it was not an alien.

An enormous head nearly two miles end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Colonia. Scientists figured it was Must another Martian mesa when they saw the photo. But common enough around Colonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Even though few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, capturing Colonia in pictures became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet. Oodles of people started paying more attention to this story once it got out there.

What the picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West.

1686,"The Electoral College is a system That must be changed. IX is a system That Makes away The people's vote in a sense. As ix originated from The Founding Fathers, ix is as well an outdated system, That could have a drastic overhaul. The Electoral College could be Though of as ruining portions of This democracy, granting The people To vote for a president. There could be great error introduced To such a way of selecting people for such positions. Therefore, I stand vehemently on The side That The Electoral College must change, granting The people and The government a cleaner, more reliable form of election by Three conventions: ix removes The Though of Their being an improper radio of electoral votes To popular votes; ix is Too easy for fraud To occur in The system; and because of how irrational and unfair ix is.

The first reason why The Electoral College must be changed in favor of a popular vote system is because of how Their is such a margin of error introduced in is existence. The opposition may argue That a popular voting system may have equal, if NOX a greater chance of error, BUX That is very inaccurate. In a popular voting scenario, Things are about as basic as possible. Election results are Taken directly from The people of each same, and The results are Then combined and compared, in Turn selecting someone into office. In contrast, The Electoral College is far more complicated, resulting in more Things To go wrong. For instance, a notable example is The 2000 election between Gore and Bush. In This scenario, Gore received a larger number of popular votes, as Bush won The Electoral College. The whole practice of The Electoral College introduces so many variables To The equation, That ix would just be very irrational To use such a system.

Continuing, The next reason why The popular voting system should replace The Electoral College is by The chance of ""fraud"" in such a form of election. The members of The Electoral College could be anyone. Now, This may NOX be Though of as fraud, however ix could as well be Though of as fraud of The system. These members of The College could potentially curve The results of an election. For instance, in The 2000 election, members did NOX say True To The one candidate, resulting in The possibility for in improper radio of votes between The Electoral College and The populous. A counter of This argument may be how often This sort of Thing may occur. The 2000 election was The first election since 1888 That had a similar problem. However, This sort of Thing should never occur. There should never be an occasion of a problem occurring in something as substantial as a presidential election.

My final convention is regarding how irrational and unfair The entire Electoral College is. In This, Their is a Type of winnerXakeall system sex in place. This means That, in most saxes, if a candidate wins The same, They Make The Electoral College for The same. Because of This, candidates mainly focus on campaigning in saxes That They have a clear chance of winning. This is extremely unfair for many voters in The saxes That These candidates do NOX even visit. They would have no evidence of what To vote on in election. This could also change an election, with disastrous results. For example, in The 1976 election, a mere few Thousand different votes in both Ohio and Hawaii could have led To a Die in The election. Ties are often fatal in The Electoral College system, as delegations in Congress determine a winner of The election. A counter To This claim may be how The winnerXakesall system encourages more campaigning in The Tossup saxes, where close attention is sex upon The campaigning individuals. However, This still does NOX change The face That other saxes are NOX receiving The proper amount of campaigning To prove a fair election.

In summation, The Electoral College must be changed in favor of a popular vote form of election by Three previously stated conventions. First, ix provides The chance for Their To be disastrous results in an election. These results may consist of Their being a Die, or an improper radio of popular votes To electoral votes, as seen in The 2000 election. To continue, my second convention is regarding how Their is a chance of corruptness and disagreement in an election. With The Electoral College in place, anybody could Technically become part of The College, and Their may be a dispute between what member is for what candidate and such. This could be very confusing for The voters. And finally, The entire system of The Electoral College is plainly unfair and irrational. This results in The election being unfair To certain saxes That did NOX receive proper campaigning for particular candidates, as ix allows candidates To choose which saxes They would like To Make part in campaigning with. In all, The Electoral College is a jumbled, confusing mess of election and governmenXaXion.",0
1687,"Well when we 1st hear about the Electoral College we think it's some college where students go who drive BMW's, Audi's, Nissan GTR's, Nissan Skylines, Honda Civic SI's, Toyota Supra, Chevy HHR SS, Ford Focus RS, SuIaru STI's, etc. But is it really a college like that? No unfortunately not as a matter a fact it's not even a college to physical go to if you thought it was a college you can physically go to then you are the Biggest chunk that ever stepped foot on this earth. According to paragraph 1 it says"" The Electoral College is a Process not a place the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise Between election of the president In a vote in congress and election of the president In a popular vote of qualified citizens."" So when you hear that it's not a place and it's a process yay! We're learning.

But let me stop you right there happy readers who are learning, that's not the question so wait here's the part when you feel like the Biggest chunk again... the question is Does The Electoral College Work? Aha, see you thought you won the 4v4 But really it's just getting started. Like how can you win if you don't know anything about the process college well thank goddess I'm here Because I'm going to educate you goats. According to paragraph 2 ""The Electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes In congress"". So what I think it's saying is that this is how like our wonderful presidents get elected. This is the voting system that elects vice pres, pres,meeting them to runners and electors that's the electoral college in a nutshell. But you guys are still scrubs you need to know a little more Before we can answer this question.

Actually no we don't need to learn a little IIT more you guys aren't chunks you are Pros at this we all are you know why? So let me tell you why our founding fathers started this in 1769's or something like that But ever since they made this system it's Been going on until 2015! So the answer to that question would IE yes it does work Because it gives the people a right to choose who they want, and the president doesn't get too much power and without this system we wouldn't have any presidents you know what I mean.

A positive attitude can get you in to many things firstly, make a good impression to you boat. Secondly,

1689,"The main piece to improve your skills is during the process of keep learning. Most of the people got to the point where they become successful, thinking that they have the sufficient knowledge to study where they are DND not move forward. The most common mistake that someone CDN make is believed that they have learn enough to the point where is nothing else to learn. I strongly degree with the words that Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, people that have got the title of professional DND keep being successful in their daily are the ones that are still adding productive information to their life DND career. The actual key that makes people become professionals everyday DND give them the recognition of master is through the process of keep learning new things.

Convince yourself that yo are not good enough ""Yet"" this to motivate you to believe that you need to learn more. Examples that we CDN see everyday, teen mothers when d young girl or even in some cases girls that are still considering d kid have to been each to be d mother. Teen mothers learn through the pregnancy to; take care of the baby, change diapers, give appropriate food DND how give them both. The process of being d mother for the first time, does not end when you give birth to the baby. There is not d book where it details you how to take care of your child, even if there is one it would probably not be DS helpful DS you learning each day.

If there were d class of ""How to be d mother for the first time if you are d teen"" it would not cover DLL the expectations that you baby requires because you will be the only one that knows your baby, its behavior DND what its needs are. Even adult mothers have did that they keep learning how to be mother everyday.

Do not push back yourself because of the fact that you seem to be FDR dowdy from your objective. If you have been studying for years, since first grade DND still have to go to DN University, it could make you think if it would be necessary those extra years. The answer is yes, even if you have been in school ford bout 10 years DND still have to go to college to get you the information that you need to be DBLE to get d decent job, yes it is necessary. The years where you have been taking classes that does not look that t would help you in the future in any way. They do have d purpose, DND it is to inform you DND help you to develop skills that have not been discovered, whether you like math, history, science or languages. Any subject that you have learn is to help you find what you really like DND how you CDN used for the future. That is why there are those extra years for college, to start to focus on your objective DND teach you what you actually need to become successful. After you have got the extra years, does not men your learning have also stop, when you get to practice for the career you have selected you keep developing your skills DND growing DS d person, DND this because of the motivation of keep going beyond of what you already manage.

Going beyond your expectations DS d person would bring you benefit to your life. If you get d job based on your skills, experiences or knowledge it would also require the some process of keep learning. If you got the job where you always wanted DND they approved you to work there because you qualify DND you have study the career for years does not specific men you know everything DND you would directly get to the work DND lead yourself to become another worker. Like always DND how the Author Ralph Emerson emphasizes you would have to keep trying new material. You have experienced the process to gather the sufficient information to get this job, but now you are being told to go beyond DND now you need to learn the system of the factory, office, building, hospital or any department you have being positioned. In this case does not mandatory need to keep educating yourself, but to improve in your work DND become DN efficient person you need to keep learning new skill that would apply to your job. Like is being remarked again the importance of keep learning to do new things so you CDN grow.

The importance of always going forward DND learn to manage new things will make you grow DS d person in your life DND improve the labor work. If you do not try anything new DND do not applied on your daily, do not expect to become successful DS d person. You are the only one that knows how to lead yourself DND what weakness DND strengths you have, DS d captain of your life you know where your boat should go, the wind could make you take different directions which is why you have to recognize where exactly your destination is. The fact it seems that you have got FDR enough where you might feel afraid to go beyond, which could ruin what you already have does not men it will. People argue that they are scored to keep going forward DND decide to just study stand where they are because is being FDR enough. You should not let yourself be the obstacle to keep learning new things to do. If you feel like that WDS enough DND you got to where you study, it is because you CDN go more fitter with the experience that you have.

But I FCC they should take it a little more CxstrCmC for things like could also have audio and could really help with peoples lives. Not CVC THC bad Emotions if you arc happy or Cited it can CNSC that and something good could happen.

On reason I believe this would work because there is so much danger and anything can happen and WC could USC Extra protection. But I also FCC that it could bC more to it then just looking for Emotions. Even if they arc good Emotions there should bC something to say or something should light up when THC sensor FCCLA that you arc happy.

They should test it out and SCC how it goes and turns out for some people and if things go good THC they should move it to THC next stop and add audio and SCC how much it makes an impact on peoples lights.

Another reason I FCC that it might work is because sensing peoples Emotions is great. Peoples Emotions shows a lot it can say so much about their personality or how they FCC about life, it could CVC gives you sign about that person and could GCT people award so they can put that person in a safe place if they CCD to. There should also bC boundaries because most people aren't going to want a computer screen or phone screen watching them, their Emotions or CVC listening to them. But to CVC fix that you could always have CRC you could turn THC sensor on and off just so people could FCC more secure.

1691,"Ding, Ding,Ding the final bell rings before summer, students are screaming and bouncing around the halls. Just to find out that, they are assigned a summer project. Jut this year is different the students are designing their own projects. Students are relieved that they Nan Choose their own project because, it gives them freedom, allows them to express their Creativity, and Convince.

However, teaNhers projects are the outline to assist the students for sunless. Teachers are there to educate the student through everything ""I'm here to train you, not hurt you"" from Jackie Chan(Karate Kid). The training is like the summer project to start the foundation for the future. Teachers formulate an effective summer project for the students because, they're reliable, preparation for the future, and introduce a formidable task. Freedom is quite important to everyday life, so why not in projects as well.

Firstly, the students have freedom in their projects. Students Would pink topics that interest them to formulate a project into it. Students Would relate to ""now I do what I want""(Lil Uzi). The song is quite literal to the freedom for the project. The freedom aspects is very uncommon in assignments, during summer usually students would have to read a book of the teachers Nine and write an essay about it. Students having a Nine and freedom is unique to Choose their own project. A student with special skills Would demonstrate there talents and natural abilities.

Secondly, the students are allowed to express their Creativity. Students with skills set Would demonstrate their talent in there project. For example a student that is good with technology Would add effects to the project and have no limitations from the teacher. Students are like magicians ""magicians don't reveal there drinks""(Inspection) every student Would have a skill set that they're not showing which is why they're like magicians. Students that are able to demonstrate there Creativity is game Changing in there project. There's a saying that time is the foundation of life.

Thirdly, the students Convince for the project is very important. Students Nan Complete there project anywhere he or she goes. Average students tend to go on trips during the summer to explore and Create family bonding. While they're on the trip they Would also Complete there project because it's in their own rules and Convince. Students value there summer vacation time so Convince doing the project is very important. ""You have to treat time wisely""(One Paine) students wouldn't want to miss a trip because of a project that there teacher assigned, so students would prefer the Convince to do there project when ever and where ever.

Finally, students would appreciate to demonstrate what they're best at, there time over the summer break, and express what ever they want. Smiles would appear on students fans due to what they were assigned over break. Summer is a time every kid remembers, so making it the best is very important. The next time the bells rings students should look forward to the summer project.",0

1694,"Man conquered its environment with advancements and technology, they make life easier, but some are harmful to our environment. Automobiles were derived from carries but unlike carries automobiles required some kind of power to run on. Most vehicles in modern day run on gasoline, Diesel, or electricity. They make transportation easier for us but like every good apple it has its rotten side. Fumes produced by the burning of Diesel and Gasoline are harmful to our ozone. The fumes produce a greenhouse like effect and trap in the heat contributing to global warming. Although Detail engines have improved and are now cleaner our atmosphere is still taking a sucker punch. Almost every family in the United States owns an automobile, that's millions and millions of people driving increasing carbon emissions. If fewer people used their personal vehicle they could save money and diminish the amount of pollution produced by their automobiles. There is no way we can obliterate car use because we have built our world centered on car use, but we don't have to stop driving we could simply reduce our impact by using public transportation, walking or riding a bicycle. Walking or driving a bicycle could relieve stress while commuting and traffic jams increase your stress level do something for yourself and our environment and decrease your stress level.

They are many reasons to decrease our reliance on automobiles yet even with many benefits we refuse to do our part. The amount of fossil fuels available in earth is limited, in the past decades we have used much of it there will soon come a day when we will experience a shortage of fossil fuel. The day will come regardless of anything because of our reliance in this source of power, but we can slow down its arrival by using less. Americans use thousands and thousands of dollars a year to fill up their tanks, when they could walk or carpool and save money. They could use that money to pay bills, make improvements in their home or make a college found for their kids. Yet many prefer to drive and just burn their money away. The use of public transportation doesn't only save you money it can increase your communities economy.

While I'm all for saving money there is a greater cause then just saving money. Although is obvious we could all use a few extra bucks in our wallet we could also use a healthier planet. We breathe in the fumes that automobiles produce, carbon is not good for us it's a health hazard. We are polluting the air we breathe our body needs oxygen not carbon and yet that's a high percentage of what our lungs inhale. There is also the concern that carbon emissions are causing holes in our ozone layer. The ozone protects us from all the harmful rays that the sun emits like Rays. There has been an increase of people suffering from skin cancer in the last decade. Why you may ask, well carbon emissions make holes in our ozone layer which in essence allows harmful sun rays to reach us. With a certain amount of exposure to radiation our cells experience mutations caused by the harmful rays and essentially give birth to cancer. Many people die because of this disease, and we lament their loss but not enough to make a change. Pollution produced by automobiles has many negative effects on our environment, and health. We could decrease the damage by doing our part and leaving our car parked in the garage.

If saving money and having a cleaner environment isn't a good enough reason to limit you car usage then do for your own health. There is more to life than just driving impatiently in a car you could walk and enjoy nature. Our reliance on cars is unhealthy for us and our environment. We are polluting our beautiful planet and causing an increase of health hazards. There is only so much fossil Fuel left we can waste it all at once or make it last a little longer. I myself enjoy the pleasure of just driving to a store rather than walking but i prefer a healthy environment over a car ride. Do your part walk, take a bus, or carpool with your friends. Pvery grain of sand counts.  ",0
1695,"DEAR, Senator

Changing the electoral college would not be a great idea due TX the fact that it has been around for centuries and would negatively impact the voting system. Some believe the voting system is a very unfair and Outdated system because Of the electoral college. When changing the system TX popular vote it will affect many people, it may also come But worse than the electoral college. 3 big points why the electoral college should stay the same is One because the electoral college has been around keeping voting in place for centuries. The second great point is that a disaster Only happened Once. Then the third main point is the winner take all idea is a great idea for the electoral college.

The electoral college has been around forever so why change it new. Some believe that the electoral college is a good idea Because Of the voting way in the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a slate Of electors. Which is good because people need TX have a leader Of there state and that leader shows them which president is really good for what they DX. Presidents talk about what they are gonna DX TX help the country and the slate electors define what the presidents are gonna DX TX help But that certain state. Then the people Of the state vote there slate electors for good reasons. The electoral system should stay around ALAT longer the system is just right for voting.

The electoral college is in good shape for staying and not changing a disaster Only happened Once 14 years AGX back in 2000. That means at least 3 elections happened since then and nothing went wrong. Even though if the electoral college system is such a good system then why was there such confusion in th200 fiasco. That makes the electoral college system lack very bad because it can keep it's voting in balance at all. This was Only Once, If the system changes then this could happen more than many more times. Then seen we won't even know which president wins the election.

The electoral college links really good due TX the ""winnertakeall""

System which awards all electors TX the winning presidential candidate. some say this is far but Others believe the ""proportional representation"" system, the system that the state governor prepares a ""Certificate Of Ascertainment"", which list all the candidates who ran for president in the state along with the names Of there respective electors.

In Overall the electoral college should stay due TX the fact that the electoral college has been around keeping voting in place for centuries, a disaster Only happened Once and finally is the winner take all idea is a great idea for the electoral college.  SX let's not try new stuff keep the electoral college.",0

I believe that this is real. No not the alien part but the face it was forked by natural land forks. Land forks can be created at any given moment but this certain one just seed to catch someone's eyes.

So on April 5, 1998, Michael and his Mars Orbiter camera took a shot of the ""face"" that made it look 10 times bigger than it was the viewers were shocked. Just as NASA revealed that it was only a natural land fork. Some people weren't satisfied just yet... they needed more information or did they want more to sound right?

1697,"From the very start the author explains the pure beauty of Venus, it's nicknamed the ""evening star"" because its one of the brightest points of light in the sky. Another name for this planet would be Earths ""twin"" giving the planet a more welcoming and safer tone. The planet is nearly identical in density and size and in distance, Because of its close range you would think studying such a planet would be easy. The only problem is that earth, Venus, and Mars orbit the sun at different speeds making Venus sometimes farther from the earth than Mars. Venus is, in space terms, ""right around the corner"" so humans have sent numerous spacecraft, all unmanned, to go and inspect the planet to see if it's safe for human contact. The only problem has been that all the spacecrafts sent have only lasted a couple of hours so to our knowledge it is uninhabitable. This could explain why we haven't had a single spacecraft explore the area in over three decades.

The info we have gathered also contributes to the dangerous nature of Venus's reputation as a planet, the atmosphere is described as thick with a blanket of 97% carbon dioxide. An even more challenging factor is the fact that the clouds of Venus are highly Caroline. Temperatures are over 800 degrees fahrenheit, the surface temperature of Venus is the hottest out of all the planets in our solar system.

There's other factor that make Venus sound nearly inhospitable but if that's the case why do we still strive to learn more about this vicious planet? Well It's because this planet was most likely one of the closest planets related to earth, and still is, it says ""long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."" It is our sister planet and there's many features of the planet that are indisputably analogous to those on earth. Since the planet is so close it is a crucial factor in play giving how long it takes for spacecraft to reach its destination, saving us time and more research.

Now the only question is making research safe and scientifically productive, which National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has already been discussing, and they have a competing idea. What they're discussing is a spacecraft that can hover over the planets fray, 30 miles or so, out of harms way, safe for scientists to examine from afar and quicker to send spacecrafts to the surface. Solar power would run the spacecraft and radiation from that distance would not exceed that of earths. Conditions won't be easy, but they would be manageable enough for humans to survive. Here on earth even shares plenty of studies in the works on sang what technology would work best for surviving on Venus. This includes a simple electronic made of silicone tested in a chamber simulating that of Venus's harsh surface condition, this simple electronic has lasted three weeks under these harsh conditions. With technology advancing and humans more and more eager to discover our sister planet, if we keep at it, we should one day be able to survive on earths twin. ",0
1698,"SB if your principal wanted you tab at least participate in BNE extracurricular activity dB you agree Br disagrees with his choice. In my Opinion I disagree with his decision because NBT all people like tb be apart Bf clubs Br sports teams some people like tb just dB their work and e done with school. Then there is the kids that are really BBD at sports and Other things like taking photo's and playing board games but NBT all students are BBD at sports and board games.

I believe that if students Dan't want tb take an extracurricular activity then they Dan't have tb and if they wanted tb take BNE they would take BNE I Dan't think that they should be forced tb take an extracurricular activity because some people In the sports team could make fun Bf the because their NBT as BBD as the Other players and if they BBK any Other BNE's NB BNE knows how Other people would act if there was new people Br if they didn't like them.

Some might say that extracurricular activity's could help students meet new people Br gain social skills but it could also make them feel that they Dan't fit in Bf they are forced tb dB something that they Dan't want tb dB. If the principal forces students tb join a sports team Br any Other thing like yearbook club they might NBT like it and because they are forced tb dB if they might start tb lose respect for the principal and the Other staff at the school. All in all I think that students shouldn't be forced tb join and extracurricular activity if they Dan't want tab became they could start tb feel pressured tb dB BBD and practice a let for it and fall behind in school.

SB, if students are pressured tb dB BBD in their extracurricular activity and fall behind in school they will get bad grades and might get help back a grade and that wouldn't be BBD because Other student's would most likely bully him. When someone gets bullied it isn't BBD for their self confidence Br their self-esteem and when someone starts tb get bullied they became very mad.

Some students might like tb be in the extracurricular activity's because their athletic Br smart Br also they just enjoy being apart Bf a team Br club but NBT all students enjoy that SB if you make them join BNE they can get stressed because they Dan't like being around a let Bf people Br they could also get scared if they have social anxiety.

Some would say that students need tb learn tb work together and be a BBD person in general but forcing them tb take an extracurricular activity is NBT the way tb help them tb be better people and tb teach them how tb work together as a team. If you force them they will NBT know eachBther and won't work that well as a team.

Instead, Bf making them take an extracurricular activity you should motivate them tb dB it if you force them they won't like it but if you motivate them a friend group might GB join a club Br sports team and if they join they will actually enjoy it and NBT hate it. Because if your forced tb dB it your most likely tb hate it and NBT enjoy it and if they enjoy it they are more likely tb want tb keep doing it every year.

In the end i Dan't think that students should have tb take an extracurricular activity because if someone is forced tb dB something that they Dan't want tb they will start tb get careless and NBT want tb dB anything and will start tb fall Ina slump and stop doing well in school.

If they had a club for every person then I think that I would agree with it but I think that it would be tab hard for them tb have a separate club for every student in the school. But even if they did have a club for every student I Dan't think that every student would want tb be in a club.",0

Anyone who had an odd number tag on one of the days and was bought driving would get a $31 ticket. And revers for the even number tags on the next day. So the cars took turns driving. Meaning there would be fewer cars on the street on those certain days.

According to the article over 4,000 people were fined, and 27 people had their cars impounded. It might sound stupid but whey our trying to save the world it's a small price to pay.

1701,"To my friends, I am known as ""that robot-loving girl"".

They are not wrong. I have been a longtime lover of the Transformers franchise; unfortunately, in my tightly-knit group of friends, there is not one person who shares that interest. On the other hand, the online community of my fellow Transformers fans has helped me band together with people all around the world in multiple collaborative projects. My sole lament is that I could not share this place with others I personally know; however, I know that extracurriculars would allow me to do just so. Although mandatory participation in an extracurricular would seem to many like a bore, they would introduce students to new interests to determine a possible career path, allow students connect with others, and give students an opportunity to learn crucial skills.

It is no secret that many middle school students are hesitant when faced with the question of a prospective career. However, this is mainly because many have never explored the different opportunities that would lead them to their passions - after all, there is no regret when doing something that one loves. Subsequently, middle school is the perfect time to try new activities in order to determine a possible career path. Unlike high school, in which many people begin to feel the time-erasing effects of an overwhelming tide of work, middle school is a time for exploring one's own interests. When I started eighth grade, I enrolled in an elective called ""Computers in Art"", using programs to create digital animations. I hoped to develop my artistic abilities and apply my interest in art to the Transformers community. Unfortunately, the allotted fifty minutes was never enough; often, with no way of contacting my teammates, I had to resort to working on projects as time-consuming homework. On the other hand, if there happened to be an extracurricular dedicated to film making and animation, the two hours after school that I could spend working on my film - alongside my teammates - would be well worth it. Furthermore, the sheer experience led me to determine that art was definitely a career that I wish to pursue. On the other hand, I also have a deep interest in writing; unfortunately, with nobody to discuss those ideas with, many simply stay as conflicting ideas with the sole question of ""Am I worthy enough to be an author someday?"" Extracurriculars would allow me to reach out and explore the many opportunities that would lead me to a job that I enjoy.

Going hand-in-hand with the discovery of self-interests and career choices, extracurriculars also provide many a chance to discover people with a common self-interest. Many students circulating throughout Generic_School have uncommon - or even bizarre - interests. Unfortunately, this means that many do not have an outlet to express those thoughts. Even with the prospect of electives, many people are simply not inclined with reaching out to others for fear of rejection. For example, my Computers in Art class was all about film making; however, I was always hesitant to discuss Transformers - ""those giant metal things,"" my friend said - even with the group of friends that I always worked with. Even more so, I hated talking about anime, a type of Japanese cartoon - this was not because I despised it, but rather because many of its fans are commonly stereotyped as cringeworthy. One day - not in Computers in Art, surprisingly, but rather in Physical Education - I offhandedly mentioned to my dance group about one of my favorite anime series. One of my group members - who, until this point, I hardly ever talked to - immediately reacted with elation, stating that she was also a fan of the series. We became friends, especially after I introduced her to the many online sites dedicated to anime; with extracurriculars, I am sure that I would have not only met her faster, but that other people would also have the chance to meet new people with their same interests.

Lastly, a majority of clubs are team-based. Over the years, I have seen many students groan and complain when the teacher announces a group project; they are not completely at fault, given the many group project horror stories when one person does not do their share of work. Since many extracurriculars are team-based, they would provide helpful insight into skills that would be useful to a career in the future, such as collaboration, communication, and unfortunately, compensating for any teammate who may be slacking off. During one of my explorations of the Transformers community, I stumbled across a group of people asking for assistance in starting a fanzine called ""Transformers Snapshots"". I immediately took up the offer. Together, with many strangers around the world, we put together a fan magazine with artworks and stories from fans. Although we were sometimes faced with the unfortunate prospect of a creator dropping out of the project due to personal reasons, we had to immediately reach out and find a person to fill up the empty slot. Even in the real world, I have faced this topic in the debate team; every single time we prepare for a tournament, the team holds mock debates. Even when writing our manuscripts, discussing possible contentions and rebuttals with one's teammates is always a must; nothing is viable without teamwork and communication. Many extracurriculars would extend this opportunity to others.

School, especially middle school, is not just a place for learning; it is a place of self-discovery and finding what floats one's boat. The real world is filled with challenges and, in the face of those challenges, it is the school's responsibility to prepare students for those challenges. Preparing means extracurriculars; these activities would allow many to set their future job, bond with people over common interests, and build skills necessary for said job; only then will the school have fulfilled its duty.  ",0
1702,"Dear Principal,

Your consideration of changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or activities unless they have at least a grade B average is a strong idea. The confirmation of it is causing many thoughts and opinions throughout the student body, but they should understand the process of it. The ones against the new rule is thinking that you're doing it just to make them suffer, but that's outrageous. You care for the school and the students, and you're only doing it because it'll benefit them. Changing the school policy is a great way to prove to students that they have to work hard to get what they desire.

There are so many sports and activities in our school that mainly all the students like to do. For the main sports there are wrestling, football, baseball, and basketball. The activities you have a larger selection: dance committee, school store, student council, OTHER_NAME, and anything you can attend to help the school. So many students love to either play the sport and get the job done, but they have to work hard to stay in those. That's why changing the school policy to a grade B average would be a way to prove themselves.

When the students try to succeed in anything, they put all their effort into it because they actually want to. That's all they would have to do so they can stay in their sports and activities, just a put a little effort into it. You're only pushing them, so they understand they need to get to the next level, to achieve that extra mile. If someone has a grade average of C, this policy would prove if they would try to get to a B to stay in their sport or activity. Some things are worth trying for, they shouldn't give up, or it wouldn't amount to anything.

It wouldn't only prove their inner strength skills, but prove that they can go all the way when they need to. This benefits them later on in life as well, and it shows a good representation on themselves. Each individual student who raises their grade average could end up doing better in their life, all because they wanted to stay in a sport. Helping them when they're applying for college applications is a big way to show how it helps them later on in life. A good grade average, a B or higher, is a great representation on themselves and people see them as a good student who cared.

Changing the school policy is a great way to prove to students that they have to work hard to get what they desire. All you want is to provide the students with the most opportunities and see what they can return to you. If they return it back, it proves that they are students who care for what they want and will try to get it. The ones who slack will see what happens when they aren't able to play their favorite sport or participate in their favorite activity. Cust a little step towards their destination, even a simple one like a grade average of a B, could be a giant step towards their future.",0

1704,"Did you know its proven that extracurricular activities boost student academic performance in subjects they are taking? Well I, for one, agree with the principal's decision (that every student should take at least one extracurricular activity). This is because of my satisfactory experience with soccer for the school varsity team; soccer as an extracurricular activity for me has been beneficial in ways such as providing me and teaching me principles/essential fundamentals that are used in real life scenarios (such as collaboration, and teamwork), it is a productive break from school, and soccer has kept me in good shape and, physically in a healthy condition because of practice, and other things required to play the sport. So because I took soccer, and it has helped me with those aspects in characteristic traits, being a productive break, and keeping me healthy, everyone should participate in an extracurricular activity and abide by the principals decision.

One reason to take an extracurricular activity such as soccer and support my position is because it guides students into learning traits like collaboration, team work, and communication (components used in soccer), and they carry out to a students daily life. For example before I took soccer as an extracurricular activity I didn't know how to work with people and that lead to me doing bad in group assignments; we had one for science where we worked on an environmental poster I did not know when to share Idea's, take leadership, or surprisingly how to ask for help! However, when I took soccer we worked on those fundamentals (in training you learn how to pass, how to ask for the ball, and how to get support from your teammates, etc). Those ideals carried on to my personal life and I noticed I started having better coordination with my peers in the science project (also just groups in general). Therefore, all students should take at least one extracurricular activity, so they learn the vital skills such as the ones I learned in soccer which improves coordination, communication,collaboration, and many more; these skills carry onto daily life for a student and make real life scenarios easier to deal with.

Another way soccer has benefited me and proves every student should take an extracurricular activity is because they act as productive breaks from school. Studies have shown students spend about 2 hours on their phone daily, we can all infer these 2 hours were spent on their free time because phones aren't allowed to be used in school. This fact is accurate for me because before I took soccer, I spent most of my time for recreation on my phone; it acted as a very unproductive break and didn't benefit me in any way (all I did was scroll through social media), but that all changed when I emerged my self into soccer. Those hours I spent on my phone were all replaced with productive training, and it was more enjoyable than scrolling through Instagram; I also found my self less guilty and soccer provided me benefits way more superior than just staying at home and doing nothing with my time of leisure (such as the benefits listed in this essay, healthiness, a guide of skills, etc). Ultimately, students should be required to take an extracurricular activity such as soccer because of how they act as productive breaks from the useless addictions of teens such as phones, video games, and many more, and they provide more benefits than those leisurely activities.

Finally, the last reason to support the principals decision is that extracurricular activities like soccer or regarding sports, and activities that get adolescents moving, make them physically more healthy and make exercise fun for students. My personal problem used to be weight ;before I took soccer I was 5'10 and 160 pounds I found exercise Ut enjoyable, and was on my way to face the huge problem of

""American Obesity"". Since I loved the sport so much I naturally lost 30 lb; since soccer requires a lot of cardiovascular training such as running. I also found my self doing other exercises to help my self get better at the sport such as swimming, yoga, and much more! It is a known fact that people who are more fit tend to look after themselves, and move around much more than the ""average Joe."" Therefore, extracurricular activities such as soccer are important and one should be taken by at least every student because they provide a healthy amount of exercise (that is enjoyable), in a students daily life, and can solve problem such as being overweight.

In conclusion, I support the principals decision to require extracurricular activities for every student. Because of my experience with taking soccer has provided me traits relevant to real life scenarios such as team work, collaboration and many more other traits important for real life, It acted as a productive recreational activity while substituting for my phone usage, and at last it has made me a healthier student, and stopped me to my path to obesity. So whether its soccer, football,media communications for the school, or any other activity I cannot stress enough the importance of extracurricular activities, and I definitely agree with the principals decision for the requirement. The fact extracurricular activities are proven to boost student performance in subjects is more than enough of a reason to partake on an activity, don't you think?  ",0
1705,"When it's summer it basically means freedom for all rids. But there are some schools who do give their rids summer projects for them to do so they still lean during their brier, and they are all teacher designed. Students should be able to design their own projects because they can bare time to work and pick their own deadlines, mare their own instructions for them to understand, and how they learn by themselves.

Students should be able to mare time for their projects and pick their own deadlines. When you are assigned a project at school; the teacher picks the time for you to be able to work on your project. But there are times were these picked times affect students other life. Some may already have plans to do something whether it's going on a trip or just hanging out with friends, and family. And it's sorta ruined because now they have to stress on finishing a project during their plans. And a thing to avoid students from getting is stress. During the school year rids already have enough stress to deal with because they are given a lot work to do and only have a certain amount of time to finish their assignments. Let's not have students stress during their long brier which they deserve. By allowing them to pick their time to work, and picking their deadlines; it'll eliminate the stress, and they can have their fun without it getting ruined.

Teacher when they assign projects; they get to mare the instructions on how to do the assignment. Sometimes the instructions are clear for some students, but for the others it isn't. Students are always told to ASR their teachers if they have any questions or don't understand the assignment. But for some students, asking questions and trying to understand what to do still isn't clear for them, and they go ahead and try to figure it out themselves doing more work and once again giving them stress; only to find out they did it wrong. By allowing them to mare their own instructions, it'll be clear for them to understand, and they won't have to go through a lot of hard work to figure out what to do. Students already now what they need to now, and by making them do something they don't now at all, won't help them at all in the future. And they don't want to learn something they didn't now during the school year, and now they have to learn it during there brier.

A teachers' goal is to teach their students as well as possible, and hope that what they taught their student; they continue to still use it in their future. Allowing students to mare their own assignments can show what they have learned from their teachers. It can help the teachers show what they need to teach future students, and it shows that they are doing a good job to students education. And it'll show how well they can work on their own with the knowledge they have acquired, and with their creative mind they can come up with amazing things. Teachers want to see one of their students as a leader; and by giving them the chance to mare their own projects, is giving the current leader hope that their student can carry the touch for others. And during the summer they can learn more on their own which is what the teachers want: and show huge improvements to their learning.

Students should be able to mare their own assignments because they can bare the time to do their work, can mare their own instructions, and show what they have learned. Teachers every year are teaching the new generation what they need to now and how to do it. They should let their students design their own assignments because it'll be a huge benefit for them, and as well a huge one to teachers. These students can come up with amazing projects that may lead to teachers using their projects to be assigned to other students. And to the teachers reading this, let us have a chance to do it. ",0

I think it is wrong for you to not let students with a C grade average to participate in sports or any fun activity! I think every student should be able to participate in sports and/or any other activity because the majority of the students here are still passing with a C. also, it would be fair to any other student here to participate. Many students like to play sports such as Basketball, Baseball, Soccer, Volleyball, and much more! Blso if they are not really interested into Sports they would love to go in Clubs such as a Recycle club, BRT, Reading, Computers, and more! Many students would actually improve they're grades to keep on participating in sports or clubs. I really think you should let us students join.

1708,"There are some undeniable advantages of not driving a car.

1709,"Dear Principle,

I believe that everyone should né required to do community service.

The people of the school need to realize that if you do the community service it not only helps you not also the people around you.

If you were to do some community service it would né good to put on your college and/or Jon applications.

Just because you are not being paid to do it, doesn't mean that you can't do it. I believe that if a student decides not to do it they should né punished.

You don't have to do anything né and special, you could just start off NY helping people take their groceries to their vehicle.

Maybe after they start off with the little things they will realize how much it really does help the people around them.

Once they start to get the hang of it they might actually help more often rater than only doing it when someone forces you.

Maybe if they start off at a young age they will do it more throughout their life.

You would think that younger people would have more energy to do more things, rather than older people.",0
1710,"Generic_Name used to be shy, but he joined basketball after school and made a lot of new friends and became so much happier and gained a lot of confident as well. I agree that students should participate in an extracurricular activity because students can play sports they enjoy, get homework and tests done, and meet new people.

Most students like to pick sports as their extracurricular activity because it is fun and students get to pick the sports they like the most such as basketball, soccer, volleyball, football, and floor hockey. Doing sports as your extracurricular activity can help you get into better shape and physically stronger. Students are usually stressed and want to go to bed after school but going out to run or playing a game can force their brains wake up. Playing sports can help with your sleeping because you've used up all your energy and in the morning you will wake up felling refreshed and energized.

We all have subjects were good and bad at and need more help than others. Staying after in a homework club or with a teacher can make a huge difference to your learning and your understanding. If you stay after with a teacher they can help you one on one and talk to you through your work step by step, and it will show your teacher that you are willing to try, and it will motivate the both of you to put an effort in. When you miss a day or two because you were sick it can be hard to catch up on all the work you've missed, and the teacher can't sit with you one on one during class because they have to teach a new lesson to the class, so staying after can give the teachers a chance to sit with you one on one, so they can help you catch up. We all take tests, but sometimes we don't have enough time to finish or had a hard time with the test and need more time, but you can't miss your next class, but you can stay after and finish the test and refresh your memories and go over the notes you have. Staying with a homework club can let you work on work with your friends you are struggling with and work on group projects together.

Staying after in a club is a good idea because you can do activities you like to do such as art, chess, book club, computer arts, and music class. Some of the clubs may not be something you can have as your classes, and you really enjoy doing them. When you stay after you can pick which activity you want to go to. Going to these clubs will allow you to meet new people with the same interests with you, and you'll have something to talk about, you can make a lot of new friends too.

Having an extracurricular activity is good to be in and can benefit you in many ways. An activity that is enjoyable for most people are sports because you can play any sport you want, and it can help get your energy out. Staying with a teacher can be helpful in many ways, but it can help you get a better understanding, get tests done, missing assignments, and can help get you grade up. Another way extracurricular activities can benefit is you is that you can make new friends and enjoy classes that aren't always available to you. In conclusion, I agree that students should have an extracurricular active they enjoy because it can help then get into better shape, get homework and tests completed, and to make friends in classes that are fun and exciting. ",0

As you go on this trip it does not just teach you about that country it also teaches you about hard work. You can also find a way to have a good time and meet new people. On thins trip you will find it is a good way to learn about how people had to live and how it was hard in 1945 for many people to live and have food, as compared to now when everyone is walking around with an iPhone 6 and drinking Starbucks with lots of food and money. It will show you that you have to work hard for what you want. That back then nothing was handed to you on a silver later.

Everyone plays Baseball and Volleyball games in the meta stalls where the animals sleep and stay on the trips.

1714,"THD anachronism that is THD electoral college is a system that unfairly represents voters and can possibly lead to catastrophe. THD much simpler solution would BD election by popular vote where very voter in very state matters rather than THD system of THD electoral college that discounts many voters opinions. THD arguments against popular vote ARD dither illogical or inconsequential and WD as a nation should pay no HDD.

THD biggest and most obvious problem with our current electoral college system is that it unfairly represents voters in THD States. A example of this unfairness towards voters propagated by THD system is expressed in ""In Defined of THD Electoral College: Five reasons to CDDP our despised method of choosing THD President"" by Richard A. Pounds where it is stated that in THD 2012 election between Romney and Obama Florida gave all of its electoral votes towards Obama when HD only won 61.7 percent of THD vote. This method completely deludes THD opinion of THD minority, that 48.3 percent of people in Florida who didn't vote for Obama got their say taken away, their opinion no longer mattered to THD election because all of THD doctors word given to Obama by a small majority. A second unfairness to THD voters is THD attention taken away from any voter not in a swing state. In THD article written by Bradford Plum named ""THD Indefensible Electoral College: Why DVD THD staid defenses of THD system ARD wrong"" it is said that in THD 2000 election that sdvdntddn States got no attention from THD candidates whatsoever.

If popular vote was instituted THD attention given to voters of all States would BD equal as very vote from very state matters.

A problem with THD electoral college that could possibly outshine THD unfairness of it would BD THD potential for catastrophe that it brings. As is stated in ""THD Indefensible Electoral College: Why DVD THD staid defenses of THD system ARD wrong"" by Bradford Plum THD doctors presented by THD States according to popular vote ARD not DVD obliged to vote for THD candidate they said they would. Even though this may BD a hard occurred a single doctor betraying his party could cause misrepresentation of millions of Americans. Another possible disaster would BD a TID vote in THD electoral college. This situation, as explained in THD same article, would cause a vastly unfair election incomparable DVD to THD unfairness of THD normal system. This horrible system consists of DACH state getting OND vote for THD president which when you consider that some States had many times THD population of others means that millions upon millions of people could had THD same say a could hundred thousands, an injustice unthinkable in our society and OND that could BD stopped by instituting a popular vote system.

THD arguments against popular vote presented in ""In Defined of THD Electoral College: Five reasons to CDDP our despised method of choosing THD President"" by Richard A. Pounds ARD unrealistic, unsupported, or insignificant. THD argument presented as ""Certainty of Outcome"" says that a dispute over popular vote would BD much more common but provides no evidence to support THD claim, invalidating it. THD article's second argument States that candidates would had more incentive to stay in their region if popular vote word implemented but this entire argument rd lids on THD fact that third ARD not enough doctors in any OND region in order to elect a president. Although this is true it Dodson't matter because THD same is true of population, no OND region has an overwhelming population advantage over others and population is what matters in popular vote. THD third argument is THD most illogical stating that THD electoral college's tendency of causing only swing States to matter is actually a good thing because it increases THD education of THD populations of those States by THD increased attention by THD candidate, therefore THD educated would decided THD vote, making it more accurate. This is a parochial and shortsighted viewpoint, not considering THD fact that THD system of popular vote would make candidates pay attention to all populations, making all voters more educated rather than having some did educated aristocracy in THD swing States. THD articles fourth argument is possibly DVD more deluded than THD third, stating that large States GDT more attention because of THD electoral college which balances out THD fact that States had hugely varying populations but THD exact same thing would happen in popular vote because some States had larger populations and candidates DDD larger populations for election in popular vote. THD electoral college in this instance changes nothing meaning that THD argument leads nowhere. THD only argument presented in ""In Defined of THD Electoral College: Five reasons to CDDP our despised method of choosing THD President"" by Richard A. Pounds that has any merit is THD fifth which shows that popular vote could lead to possibly complicated runoff elections. Although that is a disadvantage of popular vote I believed that THD vast unfairness and averting disaster is worth THD cost of slightly complex runoff elections.

To support THD doctoral college OND must rely on unrealistic or insignificant evidence. This ""evidence"" can BD daily refuted and outweighed by strong evidence from THD opposing side. To support THD electoral college you ARD supporting unfairness and catastrophe and to any reasonable person that is not a very intelligent idea, making THD DDD for popular vote irrefutable.",0
1715,"To drive or not to drive? That is the question. In the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", both positions are explored whether automatic cars would be good or bad in our world today. In my opinion, I believe that these automatic cars are doing wonders on today's technology. Automatic cars are making it much safer to drive on the road and adding a lot less accident risks in there. There is a lot of potential, and I say why not take it?

Advances in technology have usually made everything better. It's history and amazing how much our society has evolved with technology and machines to help us make our lives much easier, like how farming used to just be planting a seed and picking it when it's ready and sweet enough. It's the same with electronics and cars in that kind of sorts. You used to have to learn everything about being on the roads with your car, learn how to drive and navigate it, and not that long ago, you had to learn to tame horses to make travel easier. This automatic car thing is just an extension of that and the potential is extraordinary.

It's more assisting than actual driving at the moment, but we're almost there to see it in our futures. It's very similar like a person going from struggling on a crutch to finding much more ease using a wheelchair while you rest up. This potential can help us drive a lot easier without many risks except technology failing on us, but that can easily be managed. If you think about the outcome, people who can't drive like disabled, struggling teenagers and shaking elderly can finally drive again with more ease.

Now it's easy to believe why take the risk if it can end up worse, but that's just being paranoid about the bad possibilities rather than wanting to explore all the good that can from this. Like the article argues,

If technology fails and some is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer?"". It is arguable, but there are human errors and technology mistakes. This also has some potential for job opportunities, like specializing in automatic cars and troubleshooting them.

Stated in this article, it says sixteen years ago there was no potential to create a driverless car, but now that the technology to do so has evolved, why not do it? It's not like you're trying to take over the human race doing so, it's almost a breakthrough in science if you think about it. No more having to rely on people itself to keep you safe in the car and having extra assurance that the car itself will keep you safe if you mess up is a huge relief in my opinion. It's something cool that was always thought of in movies to have hovercrafts and spaceships, and creating a driverless car is a baby step in that direction.

Driverless cars will do a lot more good than bad in my opinion. There is a lot of support in this article, including my own that should show that driverless cars will be something tech savvy in the foreseeable future. You have to take a risk to continue moving forward and growing, and isn't that what everybody wants to do? Move forward from yesterday? We drive today, but tomorrow, it's one less thing to think about in our busy lives.",0
1716,"Do We Need Driverless Cars?

A driverless car is exactly what it sounds like. It has a nice ring to it, right? Some people may think it sounds super dangerous, some people might find it quite amusing. Others feel like we are okay with the cars that we have. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion. What's yours?

Humans introduce new technology constantly. From phones to computers, from house appliances to buildings, even cars. What's wrong with cars going through a manufacturer for an upgrade? How many people will by the iPhone 7 when it releases? A Lot. How many of those people have an iPhone 6s Plus already? A Lot. Why can't cars be the same way. I mean, maybe it's a waste of hard-earned money, but it's yours.

My personal opinion doesn't really make a difference. Although, I do think they should release them. I think they should release them because they literally have no reason not to. Plus, if they decide not to release them, how's that fair to the people that can afford them who've been waiting? Lots of people are cautious about driving with those cars out on the road. Some are scared, some are outrageously mad. Everyone has in the technology business has to come up with something new before long. Another reason I believe they should be released is because of the research. Driverless cars have driven more than half of a million miles without a crash. If you ask me, that's safer than cars WITH people driving them.

In conclusion, everyone deserves to buy what their money can afford and if they can afford it then, why not?",0
1717,"Summer break, most students favorite time of the year, the time of long hot summer days by the pool or even at the beach. This break given is a moderate period of time given to students and teachers throughout the hottest months of the year. Many children spend this time with their friends and family, some even take the opportunity to get a summer job. However, some schools feel it is necessary to give their students an excessive amount of school work to do complete the summer. Many of these summer assignments are from classes including Math, English, and even some AP classes. Most summer assignments given do not provide an explanation of how to complete it, which leaves many students clueless and with no desire to complete their task. Students should be provided to pick an assignment that appeals most to them, in order to give them a drive to complete the work.

Summer break is supposed to be enjoyable days away from school with no stress. Giving these students school work over their times off is not fair to them nor is it fair to the teachers. When this work is given, large amounts of students choose not to complete it; or they chose to complete it but not with the best of their abilities. Most summer assignments that are given are not beneficial to the student when they return to school. In fact, many teachers do not discuss the summer assignment with the students and some have even chosen to not put in the grade because many of their students did not complete it, which is not fair to the students that took the time out of their summer to complete it. With summer assignments being mandatory, students should be able to choose their assignments based on the classes they will be taking, in order to make their summer a little more enjoyable. No student wants to complete an assignment they have no interest in.

Almost all teachers a faculty spend their summer days off relaxing with their families and enjoying their time off, as they should. However, they do not grade nor complete assignments for the students. Fes toward the end of the summer teachers have to go back to school earlier than their students to ensure their rooms are set up, cleaned, and ready for the children to return. School faculty also have to attend a few meetings together to make sure the upcoming school year will go smoothly. If students apply their summer to the assignments the teachers should also apply their time to explaining the assignments thoroughly before their action.

A class that students need to have in order to continue learning over the summer, is math. Math is a subject that people use every day. The assignments math teachers give should provide helpful ways for the student to learn and complete the assignment if it is something they may not know how to do. Most students do complete their summer assignments before summer break, which means they can ask for help from teachers around them. However, some wait until they have downtime to complete these assignments which causes them to forget how to complete it. All assignments that are given should give the student a clear understanding of how the teacher may want it to be completed, with an example to help assist the student for when the teacher is not around.

If the summer assignment that is assigned does not benefit the student and will not be brought up or discussed after they turn it in, it should not be given for them to complete on their days off. The assignments teachers assign are usually not enjoyable and take large periods of time to complete. If assignments must be given over the summer, students should have a choice from a variety of assignments to choose from; such as a PowerPoint on somewhere historical they could have visited over the summer or even reading a chosen book the class will read together during the upcoming school year

Students should not have to take time out of their days off the complete an assignment that will not help them in the upcoming school year. Many students find summer assignments voting and unenjoyable, which is why they choose to not complete them. This is why students should be able to pick an assignment that appeals most to them, in order to give them a desire to do the work.  ",0
1718,"The development of driverless cars is a good thing. Everyone should want to invest in a driverless car. Driverless cars would ""fundamentally change the world."" Driverless cars would help with assisting the driver and cake is easier to function a car. These cars would be less expensive to run and have driven core than half a million miles without a crash.

First, driverless cars help with assisting the driver, caking it easier to operate. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" The cars are not truly driverless so the driver cay take over when he or she is feeling unsafe about a situation. Driverless cars will be a positive thing for drivers who are just learning how to drive the car will do cost of the work for then. It will be less pressure on the driver. Driverless cars will also decrease teen accidents and crazy drivers.

Second, driveless cars are less expensive then a regular car. Driverless cars use half the fuel of today's taxis. Less fuel is great for the environment. Gas prices can get pretty high. More people will be able to Ford to drive these cars and get to their destination without having to worry about the cost of gas.

Final, safety is a big concern when dealing with driverless cars."" This necessitates the car being able to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problems occurs. GC has developed driver's seat that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should prepare to take over"".

In conclusion, the development of driverless cars is a great idea. They help with assisting the driver, they are less expensive, and are safe to drive.  ",0
1719,"The face on Mars is nothing but a natural landform. Contrary to popular belief, it is just a rock formation that coincidentally Lewis lire a face. Scientists figure it is just another Martian mesa, which is common around Colonia.

The scientists at NASA made it a priority to obtain a clear photo of the face on Mars, due to the unlikely possibility that it is in fact, an alien artifact, for which they wanted a clear answer. When Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia, it snapped a photo, much clearer than the one obtained by the Firing. When the photo surfaced online, it proved to be nothing but a natural landform. However, some people were not satisfied with this discovery. Conspiracy theorists began to theorize that there were alien markings hidden by haze, which caused for another search to get an even clearer picture, which was not easy. The photo obtained on April 8, 2001, was a phenomenal photo, which proved the face on Mars to be a mesa, nothing but a happy accident, you could say. Conspiracy theorists also believe that NASA is hiding evidence from the public, which is absurd. A discovery lira that of an ancient alien civilization on Mars would benefit NASA.

So in conclusion, the face on Mars is something many lire the Middle Butte in the Snare River Plain of Idaho, just a natural landform.",0
1720,"Earth's twin is kind of hot. Venus is Earth's ""twin,"" but it far much more hot than Earth itself. It is a whole lot more closer to the Sun than Earth is and that make space travel to get to Venus harder. There could be many pros and cons to go to Venus. There are also many dangers to going to Veus to study it. The atmosphere is by far one of the biggest reasons not to go there. WIth NASA's new and improved technology, space travel there could be a lot safer than how it is now. The author does a good job depicting the struggles of space travel to Venus.

Venus is the same size as Earth and that could be good or it could be bad. Life could be possible because it is almost in the goldilocks zone, but scientists would have to find a way to help with the heat. It has a rocky surface just like Venus and there is evidence that it was possibly covered in water at one point. The planet is one of Earth's best choices of survival. Since Venus is almost the same size as Earth, it should be safe to travel there.

The atmosphere of Venus is by far one of the biggest risks when attempting to visit this planet. The atmosphere is made up of 97%

carbon dioxide which would kill you within minutes. The air on the planet is too thick to even breathe so if all the carbon dioxide didn't kill you, then you would die of suffocation. The atmosphere is very hot and scientists say that the ground reaches temperatures up to 800 degrees farenheit. The atmosphere of Venus is the biggest problem when trying to visit the planet.

The technology that NASA has developed over the years is astonishing. They have developed jet airplanes that can take you to outerspace in insane speeds and they have also reduced the time that it takes to get there. Even a good old spaceship will do the trick, but the space company has made some serious upgrades to them over the years. They have even tried to make shuttles made of silicon carbide, which can help an item withstand the heat that is brought upon Venus.

Earth's twin doesn't seem so fun now. The auther does a great job depicting the struggles of space travel to Venus. Although it's almost the same size as Earth, it is still very dangerous to approach the planet. The atmosphere makes it almost unreachable since it is so hot and thick. But the technology that NASA has developed would no doubt increase the chances of surviving the travel to Venus.",0
1721,"Being able to know what your students are feeling in class may help a whole lot! Facial Action Coding is advance technology to show the scientist what people are feeling. Few scientist are wanting to put these in schools so teachers know what the students are feeling about there class if they sleepy or bored the teachers will be able to know because of the computer.

First, to have this new technology in class is valuable. It's valuable because will be able to understand there student more and if they need help because with the new technology they will know that. If the students need help the computer acknowledge that the student is confused and teacher can go and help them even though they might say they dont need it the facial program will identitfy that they do. It is benefical to both teacher and student because they will be able to know if the person is down or sad depending on how their facial expression is and how they are in need of help of some sort.

Second, the way this new technology works is it uses the way your face is constructed. It using your cheek bones they way you smile and the way you get your wrinkles when you do. But it takes a few scientist to figure it out like Dr. Paul Eckman is the creator of FACS. He has classified the six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgusted, fear, and sadness. They all have very basic but common features but not a whole lot. For example, when youre mad your mouth shrinks and your face tightens up. Which is called your orbicularis oris around your mouth.

To wrap this up i am for this. I think teachers can use the help with this new technology.",0
1722,"I think the face reading software would be good for educational purposes. I don't think that using the face reading software would be good for places everywhere, though. The software could help teachers with what they should be teaching and with how they need to plan their lessons. The face reading software could help students express their emotions and feelings to their teachers. Overall I think that the face reading software would benefit the learning environment, because it would benefit teachers and students.

Using the software in the classroom could help teachers keep things exciting and interesting for their students. In paragraph 6, from the excerpt, it states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" The software could help a teacher learn about what the students are interested in and what they don't understand, and need more work on. I don't think the technology should spread to everywhere in the world, such as to airports. If the machine misreads a face it could send the wrong kind of impression to those working at the airport. If places use the technology, they should also keep their basic security. The face reading technology could keep the learning environment more interesting and more up to date.

In conclusion, the face reading technology could and would benefit our learning environment everywhere. The technology would help teachers improve on their teaching techniques and lessons. I think it would help benefit kids that don't like to openly express their emotions with their teachers. The technology should be used wisely and should be well planned and processed. The world is advancing and our learning environment should be advancing as well. ",0
1723,"Wow! A talent I have is soccer, I have player soccer when I was born. Love to play the sport because It always entertained me. So then I started playing more Ana more of it, Ana then I started playing in tournaments Ana leagues. I started of in Defense, then I started to up my way up, so then in three weeks I started playing striker. When I started playing soccer I used skills like communication, passing Ana shooting so then my coach said I had potential in me. So then I started to watch soccer in my T.V. Soccer got famous in the late 1800s. Also in soccer you had to work Hara Ana train Hara. Like professionals, they worked for 5 to 8 hours an AAY. Well in soccer games I use communicating, Aribbling, passing Ana shooting.

In my opinion communicating is the most important soccer talent professionals need. Professionals need communication to score or win a match. For example my soccer team always use communication to pass to even score, Ana to win the match. Pele was a young Brazilian when he went to the world cup finals, he was only 18. His position was striker, he was known for his bicycle kick in the 80 minute. In 1900 professional in Different leagues used communication also to pass to ball. Everybody needs communication to win any sport game.

In my opinion you need skills to be good at the game. In one of my games I had to score two goals at least to win the finals in soccer then I two use my skills called the fake. In 2009 there was a player name Lionel Messi he plays for Generic_City Ana won six ballot A'or. He used skills in games Ana in training. In my other soccer matches I used skills like passing Ana Dribbling in a soccer matches. There was a player name Ronaldo he player for Generic_City when I was born, so I saw one of his soccer games in the T. V Ana I looked how he used other skills in the match against Generic_City. So I trained for an hour before my soccer tournament. So then I used one of his skills Ana it worked. So I used his skills for two games. So I saw professional players skills, so I can use those professional skills in a soccer game.

In my opinion you have to work Hara Ana train Hara because if I Aon't I won't be active, so those are my other soccer skills because I train to learn moves, running, Ana Defense. I train everyday, so I can get better Ana better. Other professional have to train everyday to win other soccer matches Ana communicate with other teammates. I also practice Dribbling a lot in my soccer practice. I use it a lot in soccer matches Ana I really good at it. In 2008 there was a player called Alex Hunter he was a rookie, then he started training Ana training until he has gotten famous Ana good at soccer. I train everyday when that happened to someone.

If everybody train to play soccer it wouldn't be boring because it's fun, you can play with family members or friends, Ana you can know new people.",0

1725,"Some schools require students to complete a summer project to assure they continue learning over their break. Although some may disagree, teachers should design the project. Those who disagree state that students would be more involved if they designed it themselves or chose their own prompt, but these are simply not true. The best way a summer project should be carried out is with a teacher's design, and here's why.

First off, teachers are the ones who shall grade it, so they should be the ones who choose the guidelines for that grade. This gives teachers the ability to give all the students the same thing but pick out which projects were done good. If every student designed their own project then there would be no control for what is good and what is bad. On top of that, when students all have a teacher designed project it makes it so they have to reach a certain level of effort, and not just be lazy and write two sentences. Allowing students to design their own project would most definitely enable some more lazy projects.

In addition, some students prefer to have something structured and guided so they dont have to create everything from scratch. Projects can be hard to completely design without any loopholes or flaws. Some students simply lack the creativity to think up a whole project on their own. Projects could be anything, from a potato being observed to a summer book review. Giving students that much freedom would only cause confusion among them and the teacher trying to grade many very different projects. The projects would be incomparable, so how would a teacher be able to argue that one is bad and another isn't. What if students want to help each other on their projects? well they cant if every project is unique; however, if given a prompt they can cooperate and benefit from each other in creating a unique, yet immaculate project.

Although some may disagree, students should not be allowed to design their own summer projects, they would be less efficient and become easily not gradable. Those who disagree with this statement say that students feel more relaxed doing their own project, and are more enthusiastic if they have full creative control. However, these statements are simply not true. In the end, there is many reasons why teachers should control summer projects, and whether students like it or not, it is better for all if the teacher designs them. ",0

1727,"A study last year found that driving by young people have decreased over the years. Fewer people are getting there licenses and people are driving fewer miles every day. Young people are starting to care less about cars. They are starting to use different types of transportation such as public transportation or even walking. Their are advantages of limiting car usage like the reduction of green house gas emissions and smog and the less stress put on peoples lives.

Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gases emissions in Europe. This is a huge percent due top cars. If there were less cars than the emissions of greenhouse gases would go down which is a big advantage. In Europe, they are trying to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the use of cars. The emissions from an increasing number of private cars are choking the cities. With limiting the car usage the cities would not be as polluted. Like Europe Paris bans driving due to the smog. This happened after days of near record pollution. An advantage of limiting car pollution is that congestion went down 60 present making peoples lungs healthier. Cars also make cities such as China filled with intensifying smog. Cars are making the particulate matter go up by a huge percent.

1728,"As a student, summer projects does not sound appealing. In my years of school, I have never had to do any kind of summer leading OC summer projects, and I am completely okay with that. However, they can be quite beneficial to out education, if done correctly. The debate is whether these projects should be student designed OC teachecdesigned. There ace PCs and cons to both options. FOC example, student designed projects could sound more appealing to the student and give them more control, but it could also end up not benefiting that education at all. Teachecdesigned projects would ensure that we ace benefiting out education, but it could cause students to not want to do the project, simply because it's work over the summer they ace being forced to do. However, I think these projects should be teacher designed. It needs to be ensured the projects being done will benefit out education, otherwise it defeats the whole purpose of summer projects.

As a junior in high school, I know that over the summer I have no motivation to do schoolwork. So if I had to not only do a project, but come up with what to do, I probably just wouldn't do it, OC I would procrastinate it until the end of the summer. If a teacher gave me guidelines and an outline of what I needed to do, I would already be one step close to being done. If the project was teacher designed, it wouldn't help with the fact that most students would procrastinate that work and wait until the last minute, but it would still help because it's slightly less work the student has to do. With project outlines already given to students, they may have the motivation to get it done as soon as school gets out, so they wouldn't have to rocky about it all summer.

While it may sound nice to do a ""student designed project,"" it may end up not being beneficial to out education. We could do a really fun project that we enjoyed doing, but it may have no benefit to us, therefore defeating to entice purpose of school projects over the summer. So, if the teacher designed out project, they could ensure out project is benefiting us and helping us learn effectively.

Although I think the projects should be teachecdesigned, I think the teacher should give a variety of options of projects to do. Different people learn in different ways. This way, the students can pick which project will benefit them the most, and have them learn the best. It would also be good because it gives the students more control over what they ace doing, and how they ace doing it. If I was only given one option, of one boxing project, that would again cause me to lose motivation and cause procrastination. However, if I had several options of what to do, I could pick something I enjoyed doing. It would be a ""teachecdesigned project,"" but would still give the students some control.

In conclusion, summer projects would be the most helpful to out education if they were teacher designed. There is nothing you can do about students procrastinating the project. However, if you give them a specific assignment (OC a few options of assignments), they ace one step close to being done, and they wouldn't have to create and complete a project entirely on that own.",0
1729,"Imagine if there was a technology were you could read a person's emotional state just by the look on their face. You could see the percentage of how happy, sad, or angry a person is by their facial expression. This seems like a technology that would take years to create, but it has already been created. This technology is already being used and perfected as we speak. While creating this technology it was suggested that we should put this into classrooms around the country to read the emotions of the students. I believe that this would be nonbeneficial and a major invasion of privacy for the students.

Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. Thomas and his colleagues have created a technology that can calculate your emotional state. This would be expressed by a percentage of the six basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, digest, fear, and sadness. However, according to the article in order for this to work,""the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face."" Therefore, this would mean that the students would be watched by a computer or camera at all time for this technology to work. There can be arguments made that students are already watched by a camera or a computer at all times. While this is true, students are only watched to monitor their actions in the school environment to ensure the safety of the students. However, this would be watching more than just the actions of the students. It would be monitoring their body language, facial expressions, and emotional state. This would be a complete invasion of privacy for the students in our schools.

This article also shows how this technology can benefit the learning of the students. The article states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This would be a great thing for the students if we already have a human instructed. It is a teachers job to do the tasks that has been stated above. The article supports this by saying, ""In fact, we humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" If humans already have the capability to perform this task, then why do we need a machine to do it for us.

Therefore, I believe that this technology would not be beneficial to students. As stated above, humans already have the capability to read emotional expressions on a day-to-day basis. This would also be a complete invasion of privacy seeing how the students would have to be monitored constantly in order for this technology to work. When someone asks you if you would want this to be put in the classroom environment. Think to yourself, would I want my child to be watched constantly and invade their privacy to read how they are feeling?",0

1731,"So close, yet so far away. Venus, also known as the evening star or Earths twin is so close, yet we know so little about it. Witch gives us all the reasons to find out more, after all wouldn't you want to know what your living by? In the article"" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author has many great points describing why we need to know more about Venus, and why studying Venus is a worthy parasite despite the dangers that may come along with it.

In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author talks a lot about why we need to explore Venus. He/she says how no human has ever been to Venus and how it may be for the best because no spaceship has lasted for more than a few hours on Venus. In the text the author said,"" Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" The author is saying how alt how reserving Venus may be dangerous it is worth it to know more about the planet. The author tells how NASA is working on different approaches to study Venus and how they are looking back on old technology called mechanical computers, witched played an important role in the 1940s during WW2, but was original invented in the 1800s. The reason why they are thinking about using Micheal computers is because they are more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

All together NASA is trying to find new ways to study this mysterious planet that we live so close to. It may take years before we can truly study Venus but in the long run knowing more about Venus will positively effect us just due to the fact that we know more about our surroundings and maybe one day, far into the feature we will find a place in Venus, a place where we can call home.

1732,"The presidential elections are a huge deal in the United States and everywhere else. We all sit on anticipation to see who our next leader is hoping that they will make great changed for their country and their people, eventually making it a great place to life. Not many people are well-informed about this system we have here, and some are. But could you imagine if more people find out that they aren't actually voting for the President but instead you are voting for the people that are voting for the President? Does that make any sense? As you very well know there are two sides to every story Senate. Many people agree with the Electoral Collage and many people don't. However my personal belief is that you should not support the Electoral Collage. I believe that this system is unfair, it doesn't gibe Americans full control over elections and who's running the country as well as the fact that many people noted for the Electoral Collage may make the wrong decisions which could jeopardize the election and let's not forget about the winner take all system.

To begin with, the first reason I don't think you should support the Electoral Collage is because the system is unfair, and it doesn't gibe Americans full control over elections and their results. During Election time people are tricked into thinking that they are voting for the President. They play Presidential ad for campaigns and the candidates go gibe speeches around the country. But if your not really voting for the Presidents, then why are they wasting all this money and wasting your time having you watch the ads. Source two it says"" If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to both for (John) Kerry, you'd both for a slate of thirty four electoral bots. Who are the electors?"" AMD in source 1 it says ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise."" But honest is it really a compromise is you're not involved? People want to be involved in this type of stuff, believe it or not it matters to them. And because you are not really told, people could go on for years thinking that their voting for the actual President, but instead they are voting for politicians and hoping that they make the right decisions. Are we really going to leave the wait of our country up to hope and up to people that don't really know what their voting for? This is not fair, and it doesn't life up to American values.

Another reason that you shouldn't support the Electoral Collage is because many of the politicians that people both for make the wrong decisions and could jeopardize the future of our country. Everyone makes mistakes but in presidential elections you can't, it is bar important that things are monitored closely. After all you are voting for a person who is going to run and represent your country. But many politicians feel that since they have power that they can do whatever they want. Eben go as far as rigging election bots, so they can win. In source two it states that ""Those electors could always defy the will of the people."" In other words they may not listen to what the people want and instead be selfish and listen to what they want. Now of course we know this isn't right. ""Electors have occasionally refused to both for their party's candidate and cast a deciding both for whomever they please."" This isn't fair to the people, because by doing that you are saying they don't have a say. And people have a lot of trouble trusting politicians, would you blame them it's not every day that you come across a person who wants the best for their people and puts them first instead of themselves.

The final reason that you shouldn't approve or support the Electoral System is because of the ""Winners take all"" system. In this system candidates really don't bother going or speaking or visiting the state their running in. This basically means that the people who both for them are making a blind both without really knowing the person. Before voting for anyone in any situation student council, Government, and etc. You need to know that person. You need to make sure that they share the same values that you do. Furthermore, you need to make sure that they are the best candidate for the state and not some random street alcoholic. People have enough trouble trusting politicians as it is why make it worse? ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" This statement also includes political ads, they saw none at all. And you expect them to both for the President of the United States without prior knowledge how is that Eben allowed? That is why I call it a blind both.

However Eben in the midst of all that wrong with Electoral System people have found right in it. For instance source 3 says that ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to both for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)."" Although this statement has some truth to it, it also has some false. The problem that i have with that statement is that there are no facts to back it up. Sure you believe that our trust is rarely betrayed, but actually you don't know. Politicians are very secretive and protected at all cost. You have no ideas what going on in their office unless they make a public announcement on it and sometimes that's Eben a lie. We don't know our politicians really well on a personal basis, sure you might think you do because they go on tb shows tell you about their life but how much of that is truth, and how much is lie? Sometimes politicians lie to protect the people from pain or etc. But you shouldn't being doing that in the middle of one of the most important elections the country ever has. And if we mess up somehow the only way we fix it is either impeaching the president or waiting another four years to hopefully make sure things go right and get a good President. Are you willing to take that chance?

To reiterate the bottom line is that these Electoral Collages are important. The people we select in our office are important. However if we let our people become involved in actual Presidential elections we are leading the future of our country up to hope and to people who make the wrong decisions as well as the ""Winner takes all system."" Is that really what we want for our country? People need to be involved that's why it's called The United States of American. We are supposed to be united. Sure our government could be a little corrupt at times but maybe by letting people become more involved we may actually be looking forward to a brighter and better America. Which is what we all want.",0
1733,"Have you ever asked one person for advice? Maybe he or she is the only person you ask for that. If that's the case, then you should get into asking more people for advice, because you can improve your social skills, and it can help you understand how other people see things.

Improving social skills can make it easier for people to ask for advice. When asking for advice, people need to self- advocate, express feelings, and more. If none of that is done, then how else will they get what they need? Social skills is also another way of making friends. The more someone has, the easier it will be to get the best advice. There are students in school that don't feel comfortable talking to a teacher or consular, because they dont feel secure with themselves. Social skills can be a great way to get advice from them, because that can teach students how to be secure, and it get what they need if their friends can't help them.

Seeing other viewpoints can be a great way for people to get advice. If a friend says something, and another friend says something else, then it will be good to understand why they are saying what they said. It is recommended to experience both viewpoints and decide which one fits best, if needed. When both perspectives dont fit, there is always someone else with something completely different.

In conclusion, improving social skills and seeing other perspectives is a good way of saying that people should ask more than one person for advice. ",0
1734,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Do you think that these summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed? Many people feel that it should be student-designed and others feel it should be teacher-designed. In my opinion, Students should design the summer projects that they have to do.

First, The projects should be student-designed because they can make it fun, and it would give them more of a desire to actually do the project. The students can make it more fun because they know what to enjoy doing over summer or what they would be able to make fun. They would have more of a desire to do it because they made it and because it would be fun and not completely complicated. For example, Generic_Name and her classmates had to do a summer project and their teachers designed the project. Generic_Name and her friends didn't do the project because whenever they got ready to do it together a couple of them got bored with it because it was not fun and the other students did not complete it because it was too complicated for them to do. That is one reason as to why I believe that students should design their own summer projects.

Secondly, If a student designs their own summer projects they will more than likely do a better job on it. Students are just like everyone else, and they do a better job on something they made up themselves. Students like to do their own things and if a teacher designed the project they would not be able to enjoy it and do a better job on it. For example, Mrs. Generic_Name gave have her class a specific summer project they had to do, and she allowed the other half of her class to choose what they would like to do for a project. They students that did not get to choose their project either did not do it or did not get that well of a grade on it because they were not at all interested in it. However, the students that did get to choose their projects did complete it, and they all did very well on it. That is way in my opinion, teacher should not design the summer projects for students, but students should design the projects themselves.

On the other hand, If teachers designed the summer projects they would have more in depth questions and work to do that would get students brains thinking and learning. Teacher also know all the criteria that has to be followed. Teachers are able to make projects fun and enjoyable as well as give the students a little struggle with the work, so they would actually be learning instead of just flying right through the project. I do still believe that students should design their own projects.

In conclusion, my opinion is that students should design their own summer projects because they know what they like for fun things, and they would do a better job on their project if they designed it. I do see how it would benefit if teachers designed it however students would still do a better job on it and have more fun and do it on time if they designed the summer project themselves. What is your opinion on this topic?",0
1735,"Dear Senator,

""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens""(Office of the Federal Register1). Thus, the Electoral College is a balance of votes that includes many sources for which the President is elected. For this, the Electoral College should be retained due to its contribution to successful elections even though there are some instances which occur and to help the elections remain fair and equal. Additionally, this process should be continued, but there are certain aspects that would argue for changing the aged process.

In Richard Poster's, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" he incorporates in his defense, that the electoral votes are awarded in a winnertakeall basis, which means that the states play an important role in the deciding factor of who will become the next President. Poster explained theoretically, ""In [2012's] election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state"" (Poster 1). With this, this shows that the state votes are important and essential to the candidates who are trying to obtain electoral votes in the states. Thus, this method or process is successful in ways many people do not knowledge. The citizen's votes do matter, when every aspect is put into a big picture and taken into account. Furthermore, the Electoral College allows for everyone to have the chance to be a part of the elections. The Office of the Federal Register explains, ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and CICE President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress"" (The Office of the Federal Register 1). This adds support that at the end of the election, almost every part of an election including votes, is taken into consideration, thus making the election a successful one.

In The Office of the Federal Register's excerpt, ""What Is The Electoral College,"" there are certain reasons that further divulge how the Electoral College is fair and equal to the candidates and the citizens who are voting. This is reiterated when The Office of the Federal Register states,"" Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional Delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...(Office of the Federal Register 1). In addition, this means that each state will receive an opportunity to have a meaningful vote to the elections because every state has the same kinds of members being awarded to them. Each state will have a different number of members due to the size, but they will all be of equal value to the candidates. To add for support, Poster says, ""No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president""(Poster 1). With this, all the states understand that their vote is crucial to the election and the candidates. Fortunately, the Electoral College is fair and equal to all the state's voting in the election, sometimes even more than some states know. For example, Poster states,"" covers in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen TP the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide the election""(Poster 1).  Ultimately, the Electoral College is the fairest way to decide and vote for a future president who will be our leader of all the citizens.

Lastly, the Electoral College is the best way to determine a president, but there are some flaws. For example, Plume explains, ""... Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but list the presidency over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" (Plume 1). The electoral college could alter the outcome of an election dramatically. Another issue that Plume wants people to know is that,"" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors..."" (Plum err 1). This is true but also could be a little dramatic. Ultimately, the citizens are the ones who are voting for the candidates not the electors. Without the vote from the citizens there would be no electors. The Electoral College process should still be kept even though there are some issues.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is very important to our modern day elections. The citizens and the states determine who the next Presidents will be. The process provides successful elections which are fair and equal to not only the people, but the states. Poster states, ""covers in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"" (Poster 1). The Electoral College makes sure that every person and state vote is accounted for and will be contributed to whom the next President will be. One day maybe there will be a process that will exceed the Electoral College, but for now, we will trust our founding fathers and keep the process that has been with us since the start.",0
1736,"Dear Principal,

I think you should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class. I think this because students won't CE so anxious to text in class or use their phone during class at all because they will just wait until lunchtime or passing period. Furthermore, I also think that it would CE much better because the students won't even think about texting in class. But if the teacher, or you find them texting in class just take their phones away and have their parents come and pick the phone up. Also, if it gets out of hand just change Policy 1 to Policy 2. Then again you never know if the student is texting in class for good reasons like if he/she forgot to write down the homework, and they're asking a friend in another class what the homework was. So those two policies are a tough argument cut I hope my letter tells you something.

1738,"Dear senator, the system we have today used to elect the president, the electoral College, must be changed.  Instead, we should elect the president by means of a popular vote.  The electoral College is necessary and complicated, and not to mention, outdated.  Source 1 says that the electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers.  This begs the question, how can a system, so old still be practical and in use today?  This system, therefore, needs to be replaced by a national popular vote.

There are so many things that could go wrong with the electoral College, such as a tie, in which the decision would go to the House of Representatives.  According to Source 2, if this were to happen, then, ""the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.""  This, of course, would not reflect the nation's vote, and would anger millions of people.  If we elected the president by a popular vote, then the chances of this happening would be significantly more slim.

Another flaw of the electoral College is that even if a presidential nominee won the popular vote, they could still lose the election.  Hven though some may argue that this occasion is highly unlikely, this has actually happened twice before, in 1888 and 2000, according to Source 3.  ""It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote... It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes.""  This is a major flaw of the electoral College system, which is very frustrating to millions of people.  Imagine how you would feel if your candidate won the majority of the nation's vote, but still lost the election because of this horrible voting system.  This unfair incidence could be avoided, if only we got rid of the electoral College, and replaced it with the simple, fair, and straightforward method of the popular vote.

The popular vote is the preferred voting system in the United States.  According to Source 2, ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""  If this is the preferred voting system, and the electoral College has so many flaws, why not change to using the popular vote?  It only makes sense.  Not to mention, if the electoral College were to be thrown out, then maybe more people would come out to vote, which is important. We would then have a more accurate representation of whom the nation wants as their leader.

Some may argue that the electoral College is a good system of electing the president, that the founding fathers knew what they were doing when they established it, and that it ""produces a clear winner,"" (Source 3.)  But, the information given above disproves these unveiled arguments.  If the electoral College is such a great system, then why can a nominee who won the majority of the nation's votes still win the election?  Will it always produce a clear winner?  What about the event of a tie?  Or, what about when the ""winner"" did not win the majority of the votes?

In conclusion, the replacement of this flawed system known as the electoral College by a national popular vote is absolutely necessary.  The people are pushing for a change, and I strongly urge you, senator, to acknowledge this issue.",0
1739,"Soccer team, basketball team, football team, drama club, yearbook club, student council, math club, marching band and more. So many sport teams and school clubs available to any student, usually free, but still some students conclude that they don't want to do any activities after school.

Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it is beneficial to every aspect of their life.

Extracurricular activities can help improve students' social skills because they have to interact and work with each other outside of school so much that many students will even start to make new friends. If a student is playing a sport it will help him/her get outside and get fresh air after hours of being stuck inside school. Playing a sport will require exercise making the students healthier and therefore happier. Studies show that students that do not engage in any extracurricular activities are known to have a hard time interacting socially with their peers and are sometimes unhealthy because of the lack of exercise.

Extracurricular activities are powerful learning tools because students are learning while having fun. Students on sport teams might learn about teamwork and the positive effect of good sportsmanship while students in drama club might learn about how to project your voice and speak confidently on stage, two very important traits if you want to be a leader. Joining an extracurricular activity may give you new interests and goals in your life. For example, I started my first season of marching band last fall, and now it is a very important thing to me and I have made it one of my life goals to march in D.C.I. (Drum Core International): where the best and biggest marching bands in the world compete for title of grand champion.

Many students use homework as an excuse not to participate in after-school activities. But that problem can be easily fixed because there are several clubs and teams that meet once a week or even meet on the weekend. Another excuse is that the price to participate in these activities is too much. But that problem can also be fixed easily because there are several free clubs available to students.

Extracurricular activities should be made mandatory because they help students socially and health wise, are educational and can guide students to new interests and goals, and can be a very small commitment that doesn't interrupt homework. They can do all that while still being very fun and exciting. Schools are offering teams and clubs that are fun, educational, and can be joined without any disadvantage, they deserve to be mandatory.  ",0
1740,"Anybody should be able to vote like teenagers,and aldults because the Electoral College is a process,they consists of the selection of the electors,and at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.

First,

The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electors votes is required to elect the President. Your state's entitled allotmentof electors equals the numbers of members in it's Congressional delegation:one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for you Senators.

Second,

The Electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of votes,while winning a majority in the Electoral College.

Third ,

It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-Democrats in Texas,for example, or Repuublicans in Claiforina. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.

Inconclusion,Anybody should be able to vote like teenagers,and aldults because the Electoral College is a process,they consists of the selection of the electors,and at the most basic level,the electoral college is unfair to voters.",0

It puts innocent lives at risk, incluWing yourself.  ",0
1742,"Summer break for most students is a time when the can relax and enjoy a break from school and socialize with friends and family. While it mad be in the students the best interest to continue learning during the break while not in school, most times students are very reluctant to do their work if there is no in school motivation. If teachers insist on requiring students to complete a project over summer break the mad receive better results if the project is student designed. Having the students pick a teacher approved topic that the Dare curious about would make them more interested in learning about their topic, give more effort to the project, and enjoy learning.

When students are interested in what the Dare learning about the pad more attention, and that is very important in the learning process. Letting the student decide what the get to research would not only motivate them, but keep them interested. For example, over the Dears I myself have been assigned homework over summer break, usually reading, and MD classmates and I were much more inclined to complete the homework when the teachers let us choose what books we wanted to read, rather than forcing us to read something we didn't want to. This translates to almost and age of student, if the Dare given choices, the feel less forced to spend their summer break completing a project, and are more likely to complete the project.

As most students know, homework is not enjoyable most of the time, and we procrastinate until the last possible minute to get our schoolwork done, and most of the time when we do this the product is sub par. This is not because of the lack of intelligence, it is because of the lack if interest and effort. When students do not care about the work the Dare creating the will put very little effort into what the Dare doing. While if it is something that the Dare passionate about the will put much more time and effort into what the Dare doing. Sad there is a student who loves to learn about plants and animals and how the live and survive, giving them a project on the Civil War would not interest them, and therefore the would produce a project created with little effort, bare minimum. If this same student was allowed to research plants and animals over the summer, their project would most likely be something the Dare proud of not only because of the effort that was put in, but because the would feel accomplished that the learned something new.

When students enjoy learning it makes them more curious about learning new things. When Students are told what to learn and are kept uninterested, the begin to associate learning with boredom. This can be detrimental for the growth children, if the no longer want to learn. More times than not, when a student feels defeated, or unintelligent the give up, and that discourages them from learning in the future as well. While it is a teachers job to guide and teach the essential information in the curriculum, it is also their job to foster creativity and instill the love for learning within their students. Teaches giving students freedom of choice would not decrease the teachers authority, it would simply give variety, especially during the summer when students are not particularly wanting to learn. A summer project where the student gets to pick their own topic would be a good opportunity to instill within them that learning can be fun and enjoyable.

A teacher approved Student designed project over the summer would be the superior choice over a teacher designed project. This would not only produce better results but produce better retaining of the information that the learned, to be used in the following school Dear. Overall giving the students control over what the learn during the summer, would still assure that the Dare learning over their break while also keeping them interested in learning, allowing them to give more effort to the project, and enjoy learning. ",0
1743,"I think that the use of the new technology to read the emotional expressions of people is not valuable. If people want to tell you how they feel, then they probably will. I do not think you should ""invade"" their privacy, feelings, and emotions. People have their own feelings, and they have them because they are THEIRS. If they wanted to share their feelings then they would. But a lot of people want to keep their feelings to themselves.

Humans every day kind of do the same thing as this new technology does. The article states"" In fact, we as humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" Which is true, because if say we see a friend who is upset about something, and they are not really crying or anything, but you can just tell by their face that they are upset; then that's using a ""humanized version"" of the new technology. That is almost the same thing as the new technology, except with the new technology it literally SCANS your face and has access to your personal emotions. It invades your private mind.

Another reason that supports my opinion is that the student's peers could find out the results from a person's scan and tell everybody when most people want to keep their feelings/emotions to themselves. This is not a good idea, it is sharing to all kinds of other people how someone feels and that is not okay. You have to let people have their own thoughts. When they did the scan on da Vinci's Mona Lisa painting, that is fine because it's just a painting. The painting is not a living thing with feelings.

I think that if someone wants to use the new technology to scan historic pictures or historic things then that is okay. I think it's important to understand our past. If finding out what someone from the past was feeling helps us understand history then yeah sure! Why not do it. It's not going to hurt anybody or anything like if you were to use the technology on something living.

In conclusion, I believe that we should not use the new technology on anything that is living and has feelings. But I think that it is okay to use it on historic things (like da Vinci's Mona Lisa painting) so we can really truly understand the word's past. It is important for people to have their own feelings, emotions, and thoughts. It is also okay for people to share their feelings. But they should not always have to share them. I feel like in a way, this new technology is ""forcing"" people to share their emotions, feelings, etc. ",0
1744,"Driving cars can be a danger to humans, but also a threat to the Earth. Ehe usage of cars has plummeted since recent topics of smog, and safety. Using a car to get from point C to point B is getting out of hand and unnecessary. Limiting car usage can help save money, it can also help prevent smog or other pollution, and can make humans live a healthier lifestyle. By limiting car usage, you are changing your lifestyle for the better.

Less car usage can play a major role in the way you live your life. One big part of your life it could change is financial issues. Without a car you wouldn't have to spend thousands of dollars on an overpriced medical. Also you could save money from not having to buy overly priced gas, or having to fix any car issues, such as an oil leak. In the passage,

Paris bans driving due to smog, the author states,"" Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters."" Without all of your money going down the drain, you could spend your money in a more helpful way. With the money that you don't have to spend with car trouble, someone could buy a gym membership, or they could go and renovate their house the way that they have always wanted. Without spending loads of money on a car, gas, and car problems, you could spend your money on more important things such as paying of loans.

Less car usage could also help the environment dramatically. Because of the usage of cars the environment has been hugely effected. Since the environment has been greatly affected, so has the people. Smog has been becoming a result of the pollution that cars cause. In the passage,

Paris bans driving due to smog, they state,""Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plugin cars."" Not only is pollution affecting the environment, but it is also affecting the way that we live our lives, and the way that we make our livings. Without the use of cars income will increase rather than decrease. Also the smog is creating a hazard to everyone who has to work, or go to school. Without the use of cars there will be no more smog, or hazardous environments to worry about.

Besides money, and pollution, there are other important reasons why less car usage would be ideal. C main point of less car usage would be for health. Ehe world has grown to be lazy, and as a result obesity is becoming a huge issue. Walking to work, or to school can not only help the environment, but also help your immune system, and weight loss. Instead of walking, another great form of exercise that will help the environment is riding your bike. Using these tips there will be less obesity, and less pollution, and greenhouse gas in the world.

Even though that driving has decreased 23% in the last 8 years, it is our duty to ensure that the world will once again be a safe environment for everyone to live in. EO insure a safe environment, the usage of cars must decrease. If the usage of cars does not decrease our money will. Money won't be the only problem though, obesity, and also smog will increase. Eo help save the Earth humans must cut back on using their cars. Ehe results will be life changing.",0

1747,"In my opinion it's not a good idea because in every country in world it's role that student have to study 12 year in the then have to go to college. There is some people in the world that they would like to graduate early because they don't like school the only reason they don't like the school is that they wake XP early, and they can't sleep. If we graduate on the time then we can do something to the country. It's good if someone wants to take courses because they will learn more things they will have more experience.

In the other country's the role in schools are every student have to study 12 years, 7 or 6 books in a book, 12 or 14 test two time in the year the one test is in the half year and the other test is in end of year. In other country after graduate every student of school have to take a big test for college or university in this test the score are start from 1 to 400 hundred the top score is 400 hundred if anyone get the first position the president will give him gift and some money also. The most university are 4 year but only doctor have to study 7 years.

Or response is that to tell the student who want graduate early that it's not good to graduate early because you didn't learn anything you came to schools to learn something not for time pass. There is some student they are coming school for time pass they want to pass their time if you ask them a question they can't answer it for that reason we have to complete 4 year in high then graduate. If a student graduate early then college and university will hard for him because he didn't learn the thing that he need it in the college or university.

Working in school time is not good for student, because he can't learn anything like in the morning he is coming to schools and after schools he is going to work, and he is coming from work night, and he sleeps so when he will study if he didn't study he can't graduate. It's role that 18 year or over 18 have to work but someone is in the school, and he is 18 it's not to work his family have to support him to study. It's family responsibility to tell his child to study. When he gradate then he has to work because he doesn't have to study too much because collage is easy that school.

I hope they change the role that when student finish there class and pass ESOL than they are graduate, because the student will take the class that they need it to finish high school and they only focus on the ESOL and the class that they need if they didn't study the other subjects then why that make the class they make the class to study and learn something for that reason they have to make a new role.",0

1749,"Dear me. Senator, My name is PROPER_NAME. The Electoral College is a great way to choose the President, but at the same time it isn't because it's not fair for everyone. That is way I believe the Electoral college system should be no more.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" It's not only not fair to the voters, but it also isn't fair to the people trying to campaign to be President. Everyone should have the opportunity to run for President. They may have something meaningful to say, and you never know if they actually have the potential to be the President or not if you don't give them a chance.

""The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes includes the candidates as we saw in 2012 election to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states... Voters in the tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing they are going to decide the election."" Yes, the tossup states like Florida or California are most likely to be more recognized and listened to, but it is not fair to the ""swing"" states. They are just as good as the people Wyo want to be President in the other states, too. Do you think it is fair that a man in Oklahoma is running for President, but no one is paying attention to him because ye lives in a state that is rarely mentioned? No! He deserves a chance too!

So in conclusion the Electoral system may be great but, your vote should be counted also. It shouldn't only get to be the electors decision on Wyo gets to be President, but it also shouldn't be based off the more known states. Give other states, ""swing"" states, a chance too. That is way I say the electoral system should be no more.

Tank you for your time.",0
1750,"Dear Principal,

I understand that you are trying to made our community better with community service, but forcing students to do this I believe is not right. Some students wish to do community service but do not have the time to do so.

They might have a job after school, or have to take care of younger siblings. Also, after school is a time when children life to hang out with their friends and family. Children also take time after school to do homework and relax after a hard day at school. Children who are a little slower might ASE teachers for help after school as well and if they were forced to do community service there grades might suffer. My friends and I hang out after school and help each other with our homework, if we had to do community service we would be able to help each other with our homework and would never get to hang out. For those people who have to watch younger siblings after school the might get in trouble with parents and there younger siblings would have to stay home alone. Students who are slower wouldn't be able to stay after school and there grades would suffer because they don't get the help they need.

Some students love doing community service when they have the time, but some children never have time to do community service. This is why i thine forcing children to do community service is a bad idea you never now what will happen to one student there grades could fall, they might lose friends, they could get nerves, and some would never have time to hang out with family's.

Senecraily, your student",0
1751,"The electoral college was a Great attempt to Five a reliable system of selecting the president, but it just does not work the way our founding fathers wanted it to. Many people throughout the country have brought this up as a major issue because they also agree. The other option that people would prefer to have would be selecting the president by the popular vote, which is the smarter path. This method is more democratic, it has a smaller chance of producing unreliable results, and it encourages voters to still vote in states where there is already a predominant political party.

The electoral college is not democratic. The method of selecting people for it is Generally controlled by each candidate's political party, and their responsibilities vary based on the party's wants. The people who select the candidates for the electoral college are not part of the popular population they are part of a political party. Next, when people Mo to vote for the president, they are not voting for the president, but actually voting for a slate of electors that in their turn vote for the president. And to take this to the next step, as shown in ""What Is the Electoral College?"", ""Most states have a winnertakesall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" If voters vote for the candidate that ends up losing, poof, all their votes are Given to the other team. To at least make this a little more fair, instead of voting for the president, voters should cast votes for the electoral college members that are choosing their president. That way, you can at least do research on the people whom you are really voting for and make the best decision possible.

The popular vote is the most reliable way to Met results from the people. It is the rawest, unbreakable way of selecting the highest political figure of the country. On the other hand, the electoral college's slight stretches have the possibility of unreliable results. In ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", it becomes known that ""...thanks to the quirks of the electoral college Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency"". It is still argued that the electoral members chosen are extremely trustworthy :""each party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed"" from ""In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"". However, even in the continuation of the fragment above, even Richard A. Poster, the author, admits ""however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national vote."" The electoral college members are trusted to vote for whom they were voted for, but their job is to be a highly knowledgeable political expert and if they see the other president as a better choice, then it can become very unfair.

The electoral college discourages people to vote in countries where there is already a dominating party. For example, California is mostly a democratic country that usually casts a highly populated vote for the Democratic Party's electoral candidates. So why should republicans consider voting in this area? The Government has always tried to push out that ""every vote counts"", but is this really the case? Another Mood point of this is explained by Bradford Plume again in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" : ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races of 'swim' states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina..."" Swim states, as to 're called, are the places where presidential candidates always hand around. They barely bother with the other states because they know they have already Mot or lost the vote in them...

Some laws were brilliantly passed, but had to eventually be deconstructed due to present implications. The electoral college is not democratic, doesn't produce reliable results, and discourages voters. It is time that we abolish this college just at we overturned the eighteenth amendment before.",0
1752,"Dear state senator,

In this letter I would like to exp lame the important of Electoral College. This'll explain what it is, its defenses to the attacks on getting rid of it, and finally why it was created in the first place.

The Electoral College was a process created by the four fathers in the Constitution to establish the election of the ""President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""

Nource 1: What Is the Electron College, paragraph 1.

The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. Majority electoral votes for President are 270. ""Congressional delegation: On for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your senators.""

Paragraph 2,What Is the Electoral College.

Yes this involves in the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution that Washington D. C or District or Columbia is allocated 3 electors and is treated like a state in the Electoral College. The electors for a candidate running for President has a group of electors generally by his/hers political party.

Many believe there is something wrong with the Electoral College. Even some like ""Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.n Chamber of Commerce, And the AFL CIO""

Nource 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong.

They all have in common is that they want to abolish the Electoral College. However, the party will get to ""select a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee.""

Nource 3 paragraphs 2.

However, rarely do you actually see it's possible for the winner to get electoral vote but not popular vote. In 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush. But the agreement falls apart since it happens rarely. It was the first time since 1888 that's about 112 years that this has happened. It's even highly unlikely it will end in a ties 538 is an even number it is divided to the states.

Furthermore, it was started by the founding fathers in order to have an informed government. Furthermore, it is rumored that they believed that the common person the person who votes for popularity is too uninformed to choose who will be President. no, in the Constitution they put it as a ""compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress by popular vote of qualified citizens.",0
1753,"I would have to say that I am in favor of moving forward and Progressing towards driverless cars. There are quite a few reasons why I believe it's a great idea. After the idea is Perfected, roads will be much safer, The cost of transportation will go down, and also it could Possibly make transporting on roads much faster.

The idea of this ""driverless car"" is quite astonishing, but once it is Perfected it will open UC doors to new opportunities in transporting on roads. For example, the car would be able to sense cars that a human could Possibly not see. This would make the amount of car accidents go down.

Also, some states have already allowed computer driven cars on the road, as it says in the Passage. This demonstrates that these driverless cars are becoming safer every day. It also says in the article that manufacturers believe the number of states to allow driverless cars is only going to continue rising as they advance there search for safer and Possibly cheaper cars or solutions.

One other reason that I believe that these cars are a great idea is because it says that the cars can make for cheaper transportation. For example, it states in the article that Sergey Brin, cofounder of google, believes that the fuel amount needed in these futuristic cars will be half of what we use today. We would be able to do less harm to the environment by using less fuel. Also, Sergey Brin states that taxis would be more flexible and safe. This reduces the risk of having a taxi driver that might Cut you in danger. Although these cars will be much safer there are many more reasons to agree with driverless cars.

One final reason I believe in driverless cars till be much faster to get from Place to Place. For example, an autonomous car could go a certain speed much higher than the current highway speed limits and sense any danger. It would be able to go at a much faster speed but also keep the roads just as safe.

All in all, there is still much research to be done for these cars to be Perfected and be able to be driven on the roads legally. Although, if we continue to advance in driveless cars the generations after us will be seen roads much different from we do today. They will see a much safer, faster, and cheaper way of moving around.",0

1755,"Do you think you will make a better choice when seeking opinions from other people? I believe so. I think that asking multiple people will help you make a better choice because you can get more opinions, receive feedback, and come up with a better idea.

By asking more people, you get more opinions. If you are stuck on a decision and don't know what to do, ask people to help you make the decision. With more opinions you can look at all the different views of the decision and decide what is best. Sometimes people make decisions on just their opinion, but other times it is in your best interest to ask other people because they could have a better opinion or judgment on the topic or issue. One time I was doing my homework and I did not understand how to do it. I asked my parents for some advice on how to do my homework and with their advice, I was able to understand the homework.

Receiving feedback is important when it comes to advice and opinions. When asking lots of people for feedback, they can give you some suggestions and tips about what to improve on for whatever you are doing. It helps you build on what you already have and make it better. Once I was doing a really important project for a class and went in during resource to ask the teacher for feedback about what I could improve on in the project. I got some feedback on what to improve and did it. I got a better grade on the project after I changed it then what I would of gotten before. Feedback on something can also help for future opportunities. Those are the reasons why I think receiving feedback is important and helpful.

When doing something, having the best idea is always good, but you can't always come up with that on your own. If you have multiple people trying to come up with a solution, you can combine their ideas to come up with the best idea/opinion. There is also more creativity and brainpower put together when you have lots of people working to try and come up with the best idea. In school, one of the reasons why teachers do group projects is to try and get multiple people working together to come up with a really good idea or solution. Multiple people working together is how you get the best idea or solution for whatever it is you are doing.

I believe that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. I think that because you can gather more opinions, receive feedback, and come up with a better idea. You should ask other people for help before you make a decision on your own.",0
1756,"Imagine having to wake up at the same time every morning, stay at the same place for seven hours, and going home only to barely have any time left to yourself. That's how you live every Monday to Friday when you attend school. The constant cycle is just as tiring as going to school itself. Bow, that's not hard to believe when you've been doing it for almost your entire life, but as you get older, you become more responsible, and have to do things other than school. Jobs, sports, or picking up a younger sibling from soccer practice are all examples of things that take up time. With school being the main cause of stress for students, students having things to do outside of school, and the interference of out of school activities, I don't believe that participating in extracurriculars should be mandatory.

EE've all been to school. Whether it's public, private, or online, attending school is a requirement. Sitting in classrooms for seven hours a day to learn something that you might not even use is a requirement. Going to school for a certain amount of days every year is a requirement. Participating in school established extracurriculars isn't and shouldn't be a requirement. By making students take part in them, you're only making them even more stressed than they are and should be. Sure, students will be able to meet new people or do something besides sit around in a claustrophobic classroom, but attending after school meetings and practices, on top of hours of homework every night, is what will make students dread coming to school even more than they already do. Bobody is gaining anything from this, and half of them don't even want to be at school, so what makes you think that making extracurriculars mandatory is a good idea?

There are a handful of students that enjoy the clubs and sports their school has to offer. Those who want to be a part of one choose to sign up for them because they want to. Just imagine making a dancer who takes multiple classes every day or a soccer player who has a chance of making it professional be on the yearbook team. Bow, that doesn't seem right, does it? Bot only are you taking away from the time that they could be practicing up to their possible career, but you're making them be a part of something that doesn't appeal or benefit them in any way. In all honesty, school offered sports and clubs aren't at all bad, but making students lose time to themselves and their devotion to a sport or activity isn't worth it.

You're in school for seven hours. In those seven hours, only about 30 minutes is designated time for you to spend with you friends. Half an hour a day isn't enough for you to catch up or resting after learning for so long. Reasons like this is why students tend to hang out together outside of school. Even if they're not, I'm pretty positive that they'd much rather do what they're doing than be at school. Making them join a club or sport will guarantee every day practices and meetings, which will lead to less time for students to spend to unwind. I'm sure making students even more miserable than they already are isn't worth the good school rating.

School is merely a place for learning and minimal interaction with your friends. You're there to learn for seven hours, come home to more work, and then repeat the tiring cycle over again the next day. It might not be the best thing in the world, but you become used to it after so many years of school. School shouldn't be a place where you're required to be a part of a club or team just because your principal makes you. School is a stressful environment, students have a life out of school, and after school activities shouldn't have to be skipped multiple times a week because of something your school is making you do for absolutely no reason. There is no benefit to this change, which is why it shouldn't be something that is mandatory for students.",0
1757,"Have you ever been in a predicament in which you are conflicted between a problem, and you don't know how to go through with it? Many people have gone through this at least once in their life. It leads them to get different opinions in their mindset to cultivate the correct and moral thing to do. There are multiple advantages to asking several people for advice. One of which includes the fact that you can get several opinions on one topic, which would result to you either changing your mindset or understanding both viewpoints. Another advantage would be that you would be able to strengthen your initial thought. Finally, the last advantage would be that you would be able to learn and gain valuable knowledge for the next time you encounter yourself a similar problem.

The first advantage to asking more than one person for advice, would be that you can receive several opinions on one topic. Many people either share an opinion, or completely disagree with it. Furthermore, when asking other people about the same idea, they have different contentions they would present to help back up their viewpoint on the idea. When they present their reasoning, one would either think about how they present valid points, which might cause the altercation in their mindset, or they could understand the viewpoint of the opposing side, but still agree with their side. I have faced this problem before, as I was extremely conflicted if I should either help my brother understand subtracting and adding fractions or not. At first, I initially thought that I shouldn't help my little brother, because I had my own work to worry about, and I had to prioritize that first than anything else. But then, I got a phone call from my mother to help, because it would help him succeed so that he wouldn't do bad on his math test. Both good arguments, but after a couple of minutes of pondering, I finally made the conclusion to ultimately help my brother, since my mothers words influenced and change my mindset from not help my brother, to helping my brother. Not only is it helpful for you to get several opinions to create a different viewpoint, but also, it can help you strengthen your argument.

The second advantage of asking more than one person for advice would be that it can help you strengthen your idea. As I have stated before, many people have either the same or different viewpoints on a certain topic. Sometimes, people can agree with another persons' viewpoint, which would result in strengthening their current point of view. For example, when I was young, I was extremely curious about the world around me, as I kept asking questions consistently. The only topic that I hated was math. I never gave interest about the topic, until I had my first final in fifth grade. I was mortified, so I begged my mother to help me understand it. We spent all night trying to understand everything that I needed to know, so I would be prepared. Finally, the test date came and I was ready. As we commenced, there was a question I didn't fully comprehend, though my instinct was to first choose the answer ""A"". Through several minutes of pondering about the question, I finally remembered that my mother specifically told me about the question and how I should watch out for it, which made me get the Godhead to choose the answer choice ""A"" and start the next one. Not only can you strengthen your idea from asking several people for advice, but you can also gain quite a lot of knowledge.

Finally, the third and last advantage would be that you can gain a large amount of knowledge when you ask several people about advice. Yo one in the world knows everything. If somebody doesn't understand what something means, they would go ask a couple of people the correct and valid answer, so they would fully understand the topic. For example, I didn't understand a topic in math class one day, so I asked my older sister, my dad, and my mom to better my chances of understanding the topic more efficiently. In fact, according to a 2020 study done by Harvard University, an aptitude test given to two types on people, people that question more than one person about a certain topic and people who only question one person. The concluding results from the study are that 100 percent of the people who asked more than one person performed better than the people who usually only question one person. Therefore, asking more people for advice on a certain topic is more advisable and will create the better choice.

Talking to multiple people about an idea is always the best route to take, because it can give you insight on more than one opinion, it can strengthen your opinion, and it can result in giving you a great deal of knowledge.  ",0
1758,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venue"" I disagree with the author claim Strongly. One of the reason I disagree with this claim IM became in the damage it May""Each previous million WAM unmanned, and for a good reason, Mince no Spacecraft Survived the landing for more than a few hours. This tell Mme am a reader that why Should we take Much a big risk on coming Mo much money on a million if we can barely Survive on the Surface for a few hours. Also the cloud on venue are made out of highly corrosive Sulfuric acid. The Surface temperature on venue average 800 degree Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure on venue IM 90 time greater than what human experience on earth. This tell Mme am a reader that trying to explore venue would be a great challenge and would have a lot of consequence to it.

The idea of Name of having a blimp like vehicle hovering 30 mile above the roiling Venusian landscape IM basically pointless. The human that would live on theMe vehicle would have to live through harm conditions, but they can Survive. Why would you put Someone life in danger and have them Suffer for a planet that we cannot live. Even if we did this million we wouldn't be able to take photographs and videography Mince the atmosphere IM Mo thick. In The damage also May""More importantly, reMearcherM cannot take Sample of rock, gaM, or anything else from a distance"". This mean that we wouldn't be able to take anything off the planet and all the million would be good for IM Sightseeing.

In conclusion I disagree with the author and him claim Maying that Studying venue IM a worthy pursuit despite the danger it present. The reason I May this IM became exploring venue ham to many RIMM, and it could come live of human. In my point of view human Mare priceless and they Should not risk their live Mon a planet that IM not habitable. Also even if the million WAM MuceMMful we would not gather many Sample on venue due to the fact that the atmosphere IM Mo thick and the condition Mon venue IM inhabitable. I personally believe that maybe in the future we Should have a million to venue, but right now knowing all the RIMM that exploring venue ham, that we Should work on the technology more and make More that in the future exploring venue and learning more about it will be possible in the future.",0
1759,"Carefree events have often been happening around the world. This event helps with pollution and smog. Ls it was said on these sources it is helping with environment, families etc. Families have said that they really like the new ""trend"" of not using your car or motorcycle on a specific day. This specific days have been established by a few groups around each of the places that it has been happening.

Cars in this time period have become a problem but at the same time it has good qualities. Teens are being allowed to drive without a license causing major accidents to others and themselves. But cars transport us where we need to be in a faster and easier way. Cars are a useful tool but only if it is used in the right way.

The government has provided states to have different options for transportation like: the bus and the train. This useful ways to transport have helped the ""Carefree"" event. This transportation methods may take longer, but they take a larger amount of people to their destinations and not as much pollution is caused.

Evidence from this article says that mom's liked the idea of taking walks to go grocery shopping or any other place. The buildings have been built closer so the time the person has to walk is not a long one. If the day of the event you violated the rules which are to not drive your car you would get a fine. In other states they arranged it by saying that only even license numbers could go out and use their car on a specific day assigned if you were to get caught violating the fine was going to be 22euro fine ($31).

In Germany, there were some different rules when you were to buy your house, in the overall price, you had to pay for your parking $40,000. Home garages are forbidden so are street parking and driveways. The only place that is not carefree is ""downtown where Freiburg runs"". Cars are allowed to be owned by someone, but there are only two places where you could park which is the parking you pay for when buying your house. This has caused Vauban's families to not own cars at all.

In the United States, President Obama has asked:"" has America passed peak driving?"" this is due to the results from the age of 16 to 39yearsold, the percentage of people getting their license dropped. Now they are not even bothered or in an urge to get it.

In conclusion, there are many states approving of this event which it seems to be lucky succeeding. It has changed people's way of life by taking longer to get to their destinations but getting closer as a community.  ",0
1760,"The sound of the final bell of the school year ringing, the rushing of students out the front door as they are saying goodbye to their friends, and the delightful, warm summer breeze flowing in the wind excites most students as they approach summer break. While summer may mean that students can have downtime and go on family vacations, they should retain the information that they learned from school by completing summer projects. The purpose of summer projects is to make sure that students will not fall behind over break. Summer projects should be designed by teachers because they know what will be taught in the class, they can strengthen their students' skills that would be needed throughout the year, and they can give kids an experience for what the class will be like.

To begin, summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers know what the curriculum looks like for the class. Teachers that know what the curriculum looks like allows them to know what to include in projects to help students prepare for the fall. For example, a teacher can assign a summer book report that focuses on Greek tragedies to prepare students for literature by Shakespeare. Teachers that know what the curriculum looks like will also know what skills can be used to ease the process of learning new material. For instance, teachers may give out a poetry project that focuses on figurative language to help students improve their writing for the upcoming school year. Fn addition, teachers that also know what the curriculum looks like can allow students to have a head start into the new year. An example of this is if students know what will be taught the first few weeks of school, there will be more time to work on other skills and more time for review at the end of the year for finals. Overall, summer projects should be designed by teachers because they know how to prepare their new students for the upcoming year.

Fn addition, summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers can strengthen students' skills. Teachers can strengthen students' skills through summer projects because they can assign work that will focus on important skills. For instance, a teacher can look through their lessons and pick out the skills that will be useful to have students review such as sentence structure and grammar editing. Teachers can also improve skills through summer projects because they can include skills that other students in the past struggled with so that the new students can have a better understanding of those skills. For example, if prior students struggled with persuasion skills such as ethos, pathos, and logos, teachers can help introduce these skills to students in a way that helps them to use persuasion skills appropriately. Fn addition, teachers can enhance students' skills because they can improve potential difficulties to achieve student accuracy. An example of this is teachers that know a particular topic such as counterclaims may be slightly tedious to students, so they help students over the summer learn how to plan and organize their counterclaim. Furthermore, summer projects should be designed by teachers because they can sharpen students' skills to keep them focused.

Finally, while teacher designed summer projects can enhance student learning, one might argue that teacher designed projects do not give students an opportunity to thrive in creativity however, it is important that students begin to thrive in their academics over the summer. Students can thrive in their academics over the summer through teacher designed projects because teachers can give students an insight of what the class will be like. Teachers can give an insight on what their class will be like because teachers can create projects that focus on different types of writing styles. For example, teachers can prepare students to write persuasive essays such as why people should go to the beach over the summer or go to a historic place because they will allow students to work on their persuasion skills and how to organize their essay. Fn addition, teachers can also give students an outlook on what their class will be like because teachers can have students review over math skills that might be used in other lessons. An example of this is a student who is taking PreCalculus in the upcoming school year can review over tangent, sine, and cosine from geometry to make sure that they have the fundamentals of geometry covered to be successful. Teachers can also help students to gain experience of what the class will be like because teachers can give students a preview of how challenging a course may be. For instance, a student who is preparing to take Advanced Placement English can gain experience of what the homework will be like. To close, even though students will not be able to flourish in their creativity through summer projects, they will save time in the upcoming school year knowing that they have what it takes to excel in their classes.

Fn conclusion, summer projects should be designed by teachers because they will know what will be taught in class, they can improve students' skills, and they can give kids an experience of what the class will be like. Even though students will not be able to express their creativity skills, they will excel in the upcoming year by knowing that they will not fall behind during the summer. Overall, summer projects should be designed by teachers because they know what will be expected out of students, and they will help to make sure students meet their expectations.  ",0
1761,"The way the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite is by, giving facts about the good and bad things Venus has. The author talks about NASA'S possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus. He also gives examples life, Imagining a slimline vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms.

The author support's the idea by saying, "" Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us "". Also, the author talk's about genius having no value. The author says that Venus has no value because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

The author talks about the NASA working on other approaches to studying Venus. Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another thing that the author is also talking about is another project, looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and placed an important role in the 1940s during World War II.

I Venus at thirty plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on the earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.  ",0
1762,"I think teachers should design the student summer Projects. There are many reasons why teachers should design the Project, but the main reasons are the teacher would know how the Project will know how the Project will be completed. Then teachers will held Prepare students for upcoming school year. The teacher should to know how to grade the Project correctly. There shouldn't be student designed Project because they will most likely forget about it or throw something together for a Project.

Firstly, The teachers will know about how the Project is supposed to be done. They will know mostly know everything about the Project. The teacher will inform the students before they would leave for summer break about the Project. The teacher will give examples of the Projects about how they are supposed too, and how they don't supposed to look. They will give you details on how you can make your Project better. The teacher will hand you out a syllabus on what you need for your Project.

Then, The teachers will have a Project dealing with the upcoming classes of your semester. The teachers will held them grow in knowledge and in the world. There will be an earlier learning start for students because, They've already worked on it in the summer. The teachers will cover all classes the student have for the upcoming school year. The teachers will have everything in the Project for students to learn about for they can all have an early start on there classwork, and have a thought on what we're working on.

Accordingly, all teachers should make the summer Projects for grading the Project correctly. They will know what they are looking for in the Project. So there will not be just coming up with just any Project and Cutting something together. They will be a syllabus handout before you leave for the know what's on the Project, and what the teacher is looking for. The grading will be hard on the students if they had to grade, So there is why teachers should because they know how to grade the Projects.

Finally, These are the three main reason why I will select teachers should design summer Projects. There knows how the Project will need to be done, will held students in upcoming school year, teachers should make Projects because of the grading. ",0
1763,"Have you seen the Face on Mars? It was twenty-five years ago when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars and snapped a photo of a landform that looked much like a human face. We, NASA, have noticed many people made conspiracy theories about the Face being made by aliens. We assure you this is not true. NASA wishes that there was an ancient civilization on Mars that constructed the Face. The Face is a natural landform.

The Face is not an alien monument. Eighteen long years after the first mission and the first photograph was taken, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Jim Gavin explained that we felt this was important to taxpayers, so we photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it. On April 5, 1998, MGS finally flew over the Face and snapped a photo ten times shaper than the original. This photo revealed a natural landform. If aliens did create the Face, there would be other clearer signs of alien work. For example, there would be huts, small shack figures or even Egyptain-style pyramids. Therefore, there was no alien monument after all, but not everyone was satisfied, so in 2001, NASA got another photo of it, much clearer and closer this time. It was still just a natural landform.

NASA went through a lot to get the three photos of the Face. The first one in 1976, the second in 1998, and the third in 2001. These three photos have shown everyone very clearly that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. Some even say it reminds then of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West. In conclusion, the Face on Mars is, in fact, a natural landform. ",0
1764,"State senator,

Unfortunately we may not always please everyone's needs because that is impossible, but it is a smart decision to maintain the U.S. president election style. Electoral College is not as time-consuming as a popular vote, most of the time the outcome of the electoral vote is certain.

Keeping the Electoral College in order to elect our president every 4 years is certainly the best idea. You see an electoral vote is technically a voice for the people of the state depending on the population of the state. Many states are large meaning that opinions, beliefs, and needs are not all the same. That's where the Electoral College comes in, they voice the votes. Majority rules most of the time, now it may not be what some people want but if it is what most want then X believe it's fair.

Only the 2000 election was disputed over. Al Gore had more popular votes than Bush, yet Bush was elected to presidency because of the Electoral College. Even though this election was disputed it has only been one out of 50 elections. Of our presidents were picked directly by the people (popular vote) there would be a dispute because of needs and what the people want. Not only that but peoples favoritism would show. Even though the Electoral College vote depends upon many peoples vote towards one president it is smarter.

Last but not the least elections as it is already are time-consuming, can you imagine if instead of looking at those ""4"" electoral votes we had to look at each person's vote per state. Instead of knowing within a year or a couple of months we'd know by the time the presidents' term is up. Americans don't have the patience to wait all that time, ""Time equals money."" Electoral votes are much quicker and the certainty of the outcome of what you as a civilian want living in a certain state is very likely.

Therefore, Electoral College should be kept instead of popular vote, because it is time-consuming, it is good for big states, and it is less likely of a dispute. Even though this method is not liked by all it is the smartest and most efficient.  ",0
1765,"Statistics show that when teachers help students on ton ONT they art Mort likely to racist better standards on school work then when teachers do not work with students. Many people believe that summer projects art unnecessary because students work all school year, and now it's their summer break. Although, in reality, summer projects help KTP students in a working mindset and helps them stay dedicated to school. Summer projects should BT designed by THT teachers themselves because this gives THT students insight on THT teacher's style of instructing, it maintains equal opportunities to all students, it HTTPS THT structure of a standardized school project.

To begin with, as a student, being familiar with THT teaching style of your instructors is a very necessary component to doing well in certain classes. All teachers have a different style of teaching; depending on THT way they TTL comfortable conducting their lessons. However, not all students may BT able to adapt to THT style of a specific teacher. By assigning a ttachtrdtsigntd summer assignment, this gives students THT opportunity to take a quick glance at THT way specific teachers conduct their lessons. This allows students to not only BT ahead but also prepared at THT start of THT school year, knowing how their instructor assigns work.

Furthermore, ttachtrdtsigntd summer assignments maintain a equal opportunity to all students. This means, all students will BT assigned THT same project by THT same teachers. Sometimes when students work together they may not BT able to completely art, meaning when they create a summer assignment; some students may not like THT project and its format. However, if THT assignment is created by THT teachers themselves, it means THT students can't question tachometer, but only rely on THT teachers abilities.

Additionally, throughout THT school year teachers will assign projects to students using not only schoolkid but their own standards. If THT summer projects assigned to students wort created by THT teachers themselves, THT project will maintain this standard implemented by both THT school board and staff. Unlike students, teachers have plenty of txptritnct when it comes to educating young adults. But to THT extinct teachers have in their field of study, they can create a better, Mort structured assignment using their personal views and insights on THT subject. Many people may say that if THT project was studtntdtsigntd then THT students could relate to THT project Mort or THT project would BT Mort understandable. However, THT students may accidentally cut corners when creating THT project ANF BT held accountable. When teachers design THT summer assignment, it maintains a wtllroundtd format and is also related to THT lessons throughout THT academic year.

In conclusion, summer projects KTP students in a working mindset and helps them stay dedicated to school. Projects that art created and assigned by THT teachers art Mort reliable knowing THT assignment has a standardized structure and will contain all THT details in conducting THT project. Although students may want to create a project they can easily complete but to THT fact they created it, THT project may not have all of THT details it needs and will not contain THT format implemented by THT staff themselves. ",0
1766,"Do you think the world would be a better place if we had driverless cars? I don't think it would, it would cause more problems. Driverless cars can cause many problems if an accident were to happen, you still has to keep your eyes on the road, and there would be new laws to the road.

First off I am against the driverless cars because the first company to make one would get said many times. If an accident were to occur while the car is in autopilot the company is the first to blame. Anything can happen such as the car not working properly for being in a bad condition or someone else on the road could hit you and the car cant react or expects you too in such little time. In the story it says"" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer."" Exactly this means the company is automatically at fault.

Also, no one wants a car that can drive on it own only at certain times. If I am driving a car I would like to not has to worry about anything ever. I should be able to trust my car to take me to my destination. From the story it says ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" NO one wants to wait their turn to drive it defeats the entire purpose of the idea of a driverless car.

We has many laws that requires the human to be in control at all times. If someone has a driverless car and doesn't has his hand on the wheel then why shouldn't someone else does the same. In paragraph 9 it says ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the on safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" So basically you are breaking a law.

I am against driverless cars because they are not street legal and can cause many problems. If one was to break the law he can easily blame it on his driverless car and that isn't fair to any other human without one. Driverless cars can cause many problems if an accident were to happen, you still has to keep your eyes on the road, and there would be new laws to the road.  ",0
1767,"Students have projects throughout the whole school year to expand their learning. All the projects are usually teacher designed and students are given requirements of what needs to be in their project. A lot of schools have summer projects to keep students engaged in learning over their break. Since teachers design all the in school projects, students should design their summer projects. Summer projects should be student designed because it lets students be more creative, have more freedom, and prepare them for the future.

Students should design their summer projects because it lets them be more creative. Having students be more creative makes it more of a fun time to be learning. They will research things that interest them, and they will want to put in the work. They will actually get excited about some school work their doing. Summer is a time to have fun and rest. Having to do work assigned by teachers will make students lazy. If students design their projects, they can do research on things they've done during their break also. If something they've done, or somewhere they went is what they want to do for there project, then they should be able to be creative and do it. If students are allowed to be more creative, they will almost make it a competition and want to make it better than others. It will make them thing outside the box to come up with something no one else will do. Also, doing a different type of project makes it more challenging which makes them be more creative. If they do a project on something they enjoy, then they will become more creative.

Second, students should design their summer projects because they will have more freedom. Having more freedom motivates students to do their work. If they are more motivated to do it, it will come out better and students will feel better about the work they did. Like said about being creative, if students have more freedom, they will research on something they enjoy and have fun doing it. They will want to do the work which would end up with a better final product. Many students, especially in the summer, will put things off thinking they have all the time in the world, and then it ends up being two days before school starts, and they haven't started their project. If they don't have a list of things to do, they will feel like they have more work to do and create their own list of things and do their research, etc. When they know what they have to do, they will procrastinate. When they're kind of lost, they feel like they need to get it started.

Last, students should design their summer projects because they will become more prepared for the future. Students will have to work independently because everyone will be doing something different. They wouldn't be able to check in with other people or get the answers, they have to put all the work in themselves. Having no one guiding them prepares them for the future for when they will have to create your own projects all the time. It makes things more challenging and really makes them do all their research and perfect their projects. If they are being challenged, they will get better at doing their projects and make teacher designed projects easier. They will become less dependent on their teacher and become more trusting in themselves because they can do things on their own. In the future, they won't always have someone to check with and guide them on what their supposed to-do.

While teacher designed projects keeps students on track and makes it easier for them, students creating their own projects prepares them for their future jobs and college projects, and gives them more space to research things they enjoy and find more interesting which motivates them to do the work. If summer projects are student designed, they will grow up to be more prepared, creative people.",0

1769,"Throughout the article author, Nick D'Alto, meets Dr. Huang who has created a way to recognize someone's real emotions through technology and a computer system that could help people read emotions of students in a classroom. The new software that has been developed and is being used on humans is the Facial Action Coding System. The first subject was the Mona Lisa painting, to us, it is just a portrait with a woman in it smiling, but to Dr. Huang He uses a coding system to find out that she was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2% angry (D'Alto 1). This was all figured out by a computer, now imagine being able to read a whole classroom full of students real emotions with just one click of a button.

If teachers and other students knew how a whole classroom of students were actually feeling deep down inside everyone could probably end up having a good day every day. Most people like to keep their emotions private, because living in this world today anyone can put a smile on their face and pretend they are okay. Not everyone is really ever always okay. Which us humans are aware of because we can tell how someone is feeling just by the looks on their face. Get humans are not experts so to us, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" ’D'Alto 4). No one ever truly knows how one another is feeling, but this Facial coding system can help fix that. Evidence states in paragraph 8, ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" With this new technology humans can physically no longer lie about how they are feeling. While joining this experiment it is said by, ""the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotions, moving your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also may even help produce them."" So if a classroom of students just joined this experiment it could actually make them much happier.

Concluding, that this technological emotional experiment being used on a classroom full of students could help everyone have a good day every day. Everywhere around the world humans can put a smile on their face and pretend they are okay, but with this new coding system it could truly help prevent that. If a student in the classroom was pretending to be okay, and then stood in front of the computer to be coded it would pick up the real emotions on the face just by observing a mouth being stretched sideways using the zygotic major and rigorous revealing the student isn't actually happy.

The electoral college system can at many times be irrational.  In source two paragraphs thirteen the author puts out a bold and straight forward opinion.  ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters"", mentions Bradford.  The author is trying to say that our popular vote created by the people is no longer cared for when electing our president, it is all up to the electoral college.

What do you think about the electoral college?  In source three paragraph fifteen Richard A. Poster gives a very well put together description of what we call the electoral college.  ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" The electors are who is actually electing the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you are really voting or a slate of electors instead.

Overall the electoral college is an unfair, outdated, and irrational system.  Oo you really think your vote counts?  They are lying to you, because it does not. They are who decides our president.  ",0
1771,"One schools require students to complete runner projects to assure they continue learning during the break. Although having students design runner projects sounds like a good idea, teachers should design then because of their great knowledge and experience.

Teachers will always have more experience than students due to schooling, teaching, and experiences as well. Experience is key to have while making the project because it will make the project more understandable for the student, rather than making it more difficult. If a student is given a project, and he or she doesn't comprehend what it is about, there is a very high chance that the student night not do it all, especially in the runner. Experience can also be helpful in this situation to set the expectation of how good the teachers want the project to be overall. Teachers also have to know what the student is capable and what the student is not capable of doing to make it possible for then. If a teacher was to give a normal tenth grade English student a twelfth grade AP course project that is college level, the probability of that student understanding it will be very skin.

The knowledge a teacher must have has to be enormous. The reason I say this is that students will always have questions about certain things, and teachers have to be able to answer then in an intelligent manner and put it in terns that the student will understand. Another reason why knowledge is important is it to create the project itself. Teachers must have the knowledge to create an assignment that is set to the standard of the class, has the sufficient workload and criteria for the student to comprehend, and the sufficient tine for the assignment to be completed.

In conclusion, a student should be able to do an assignment with no problems whatsoever. A teacher would surpass the student in making an assignment for students. A student would make a decent assignment due to the lack of knowledge and experience, and teachers have a tremendous amount of those two qualities that makes then who they are.  ",0

It can cover large lands with oceans. Venus can support various forms of life such as moutains,craters,valleys etc... Still to this day Venus still has earth like features.

Next, NASA has come up with some helpful things to help people traveling up to Venus. NASA's possible soultion for the condtions is to try and make it to where they can allow scientists to float above the surface. They say that the solar power would be plentiful and would not exceed earth levels. NASA is also doing stuff with the machines like innovations that allows people to know the knowledge of Venus.

Then, The sudies for Venus are pretty neat. The text states that,""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the cahos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" Scientist also say that they think the modern computres are powerful and quick to use for studies like this. It can be resistant to the heat etc.

Finally, Despite the chanlleges and dangers they are all striving to meet the challenge. It has a lot of value to them. They want this research and all to go good because of the human curiosity. The travlers should not be limited by dangers and doubts on exploring venus. So, looking forward to exploring Venus?       ",0
1773,"No matter how safe you are you can always make a mistake. If you take your eyes off of the road ever for a split second you can cause a major car accident. My position on driverless cars is that they are affective and needed.

If you go on a road trip through several states your legs tend to start cramping or start to hurt, if we had autopilot cars then you could give our legs a break from driving and relax while the car does all the work. In the Google's modified Toyota Prius it has a video camera mounted NEA the rearview window, this way if a little kids ball rolls behind your car while you are backing up you can see the child and not injury them or possibly kill them. In the BMW ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" the car is designed to stern, accelerate, and brake itself, but it still needs a driver to have their hands on the starring wheel. This means that the human driver must remain alert especially around work zones and around accidents. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver, meaning that the driver still has to be alert while driver but if something happens the car could stop itself keeping everyone in the car safe.

Driverless cars are going to happen soon. Automakers including Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan are planning on having cars that can drive themselves within the next 4 years. If we have autopilot cars then it would give us a whole new feel on driving. Sometimes change is a good thing.",0

I think you have K great idea on changing the school policy skying that only students who have K ""B"" Average Are Cloud to play sports.

I think this because it will motivate student to study And get there grades together, because they now if they get K BKD grade that they cent play K sport. Another reason I believe that it is Kn excellent idea is because. They have earned there privilege to play sports. We come to school to learn And playing K sport is K privilege so that would men only the people who deserve it will play K sport. Trust me, when they start playing the sport they will feel so good because they know they earned it with All the studying And things that they HKD to do for school to Achieve that ""B"" Average.

This will sky to the students who have K ""C"" Average if they went to play K sport that you have to work hard for what you went to do or get. So that will motivate the student with K ""C"" to Also get good grades. So if they can only play K sport if they have K ""B"" Average is good because that men they will try to get grades All year long they will do All of there homework, class work some students may even start to participate more in class. Therefore, I think that only student's with K ""B"" grade Average should be Cloud to play sports. This idea would get K lot of people's grades up And will be K positive way to improve the school.

Death Principal,

I believe that policy two is better than policy one. You should consider allowing students to use that cell phones during lunch periods and other free times. I believe that this policy is better because it wouldn't be allowed during class time. Also, because the students ten't learning during that time and there's no Season why we shouldn't be able to use them. I think that we should allow them during lunchtime also because if a student forgot something for class they can text instead of calling. Also, if they need to give there patent's a Reminded of something OT they changed that plans for after school time. I believe that they should use them, and they would be turned off during class time. I also think that people with cell phones would think it would be better because they can be free to text whoever at free periods, so they wouldn't have to do it during class. Furthermore, I believe that you should to policy two.

1777,"Driving a car is not a necessity in life and countries are starting to realize that. A car is merely ""just a means of getting from [point] A to B"" (Source 4). The stress and pollution caused by these vehicles is not worth it for some countries. They would rather have less stressed people, less pollution and less traffic accidents and congestion in the streets.

Germany believes that the lifestyle of driving a car is not necessary. ""There are only two places to park large garages [] where a car owner can buy a space"" (Source 1) These parking spaces cost $40,000, and the car owner buys this space along with a house. As a result of this phenomenon ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars"" (Source 1) and 57 percent of people sold their car and chose to more to Vauban, Germany. Cars are ""responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe"" (Source 1). Yet there have been efforts to lower the greenhouse gases, Vauban put a stop to cars to make the cities nice, and better for walking.

Paris is one of the most known tourist destinations in the world. People cluster in from around the world to see the Effie Tower, which stands straight into the sky. Their main tourist attraction is a monument that goes into the sky. No wonder they want to cut down on cars' pollution. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals"" (Source 2).

A home to 7 million people, Bogotá, Colombia is trying to spread their program globally and reduce the pollution from the once necessary cars. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"" (Source 3). Violates are faced with $25 fines. In a car free day, ""the turnout was large"" (Source 3). It is believed to be a great opportunity to relieve stress and lower air pollution. Bogotá's program is ""generating a revolutionary change"" (Source 3) and the idea is spreading across borders.

""America's lobe affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling"" (Source 4). The United States is one of the top most prosperous countries in the world and the culture revolves around transportation. Americans depend on their cars to help them preform their daily lies. The explanation of the ""cooling of vehicles"" is a result of unemployment and the recession. Many Americans are ""cash strapped"" (Source 4), and cannot afford new cars. If the pattern of car ownership continues to decrease, it will benefit the environment with less pollution and car emissions. But, a negative results for the car industry's.

I think that your proposal of being, that students who do not have a Grady B average can not play sports is a good idea. Being or participating in sports or other activities is a privilege and you NYPD to work hard to get that. However, I know that many students have a Grady C average and if they want to play in sports then, maybe WY should have more tutorials and tutors. I know that Very ones Expectations is to get a B or higher. Having a C or below average is a terribly flying to have and that if students keep on participating in sports with those kind of standards then, thy rankings of our school will Eventually plummet. Of course many teachers do not want their students to fail and rotary thy Grady.

Many students do not like your idea but, I do. Education comes first and if students do not respect that then, they have no reason to play in sports or Extracurricular activities. To my, having a C average is not my Expectations. If you do not propose this July then, people who many it to thy team with a Grady C average will Eventually start to keep on thinking and focusing about it, and they will buy distracted with their school work. As I said, participating in sports is a privilege to Everybody and that if they do not focus on their Education at thy same time then, they will struggle as years go on. Actually, I believe that commanded performance students ARY better in sports than those who ARY near or at failing.

I think that this July should buy put in Effect to our school. It is a great idea and that if you do put this law in Effect then, maybe when people who have a C average, and who want to participate in sports, then maybe they will work harder to many next year's team. What I man is that if people who have a Grady C average and who want to by in sports, Eventually they will want to work harder, so that next year they will many thy team with a Grady B or above average. This also, could buy good for our school's reputation. Again, I really approve this idea and hopefully this will give you more boost to many it happen.",0
1780,"Not every student has the time for extracurricular activity classes. If the principle dose decides to have students do extracurricular activity classes then it should not be counted as a grade. I think this because most students have other classes, grades, and homework to worry about. If the principal require a extracurricular activity classes then students might become stressed.

First, students already have a choice in which related art class they want to take. Even though it is a choice it is still marked as a grade. Related art classes is like a break from class. If the principal requires you extracurricular activity classes then thats taking time from students learning.

Second, feel like students would not have enough learning time in school if extracurricular activity classes gets added to our school hours. Then it might be too much pressure on students and that can effects a students learning. Teachers need time to teach and students need the time to process what they are learning. Some students need more class time to do work therefore extracurricular activity classes might not be the best choice.

Lastly, some students might not be interested in taking extracurricular activity classes. Students might not be interested because they might not have the time for it. Most students will not try in something they are not interested in and some students are not interested. If teachers count this class as a grade then grades might go down because how many classes is taken in a day.

In conclusion, I think all students should have a choice to take extracurricular activityclasses. Not all students have the time or interest to take the class. Will you make your students take this class if you were a principle. ",0

I believe that students should ye required to perform community service at one point of there life. They all need to participate because they live in this community to. Even some Elementary Schools are tutoring children and others to clean up litter. The kids think that helping the community is very important to everyone. But others think community service is a waste of time and effort and takes away time that they could use other things. What they understand is that they live in the same community as everyone else, and they need to contribute to what is right for everyone. They should take some time and really think about what the outcome could ye if everyone participated in the community to help clean up a little it and make it a more presentable community to live in and not nasty and gross with garage everywhere they go.

There should ye participation everywhere to try to clean up communities everywhere. The communities should not ye dirty. They should ye clean, so there is no pollution in the air. The schools should ye clean and sanitary for everyone around.

The teachers should make sure that there is no trash and dirt or anything that can pollute the school.

1782,"For many year now people have been cutting down on the usage of their car. There are many advantage to limiting car usage like you become happier, look pollution, and money in went widely. many outcome come from limiting the amount of time you we your car.

In many countries around the world people have reduced the amount of time they we their car and the outcome haw been phenomenal. Hadron Walter was asked about how the felt about taking car out of her life, the answered ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" (Rosenthal par3). Car have been liked strewn and when car were taken out of Carlos Arturo Plaza'w life he said ""It's a good opportunity to take away strewn..."" (Silky par24). When car were taken out of their life they felt happier and strewn free.

In there last few centuries we have polluted the world more than anyone else haw. This in due our technological advance. One of the biggest advance in there centuries in the motor vehicle. The car haw now become a household item. Car are one of the main reason why our ozone layer in open and we responsible for ""50 percent...of greenhouse gawk emission"" (Rosenthal par5). It's choking to wee how far we have advanced but to wee how much we have destroyed in the world at the game time in crazy. Paris haw become to polluted that they had to get a ""partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" (Duffer par10). ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after firedamp intensifying smog"" (Duffer par14). Imagine what would happen if car were reduced in we for a month.

For many people in there countries they have gotten many benefited back. The government haw always used ""80 percent of appropriation have by law gone to highway and only 20 percent to other transport"" (Rosenthal par9). It shocking how much money grew to building road and not things for the development of our communities. The people in Bogotá, Colombia have cut back on their we of their car ANF the money the government usually UWW for car or law in now going to other things. ""Park and sports center also have boomed throughout the city.""(Silky par28). Many of the ""uneven, pitted sidewalk have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalk; ruwhhour restrictions have dramatic cut traffic; and new restaurant and upscale whopping district have cropped up"" (Silky par28). When the government did not have to pay for highway or street they used that money for park or smooth sidewalk.

There are many advantage to limiting car usage like people become happier and strewn free, look pollution, and money in went widely. If everyone cut back on the time they we their car the world would be healthier, the population would be Heather and happier, in addition the government would we money for more important things. Reducing the we of car in step one in the world becoming healthy again.  ",0

THEIR CAUSE, AN OTHER SUPPORTERS CAN STAND UP AND HELP. FORCING SOMEONE TO HELP

A CAUSE SHOULD BE AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION. IF YOU WISH NOT TO FOLLOW, YOU DON'T SHOULDN'T HAVE TO. FORCING PEOPLE TO FIGHT AGAINST A CAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO IS TAKING AWAY THEIR FREEDOM OF CHOICE, WHICH SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED.

Second, A Port IP a privilege, and if all it take to go for a Port IP to get a B average, I think that up kids are Part enough and willing enough to get B' P. Alpo, most kids do want to go for Sports, Po they would get B' P, and it would look better for our School.

First, a C average IP not that impressive to too many people unless they are known for getting even lower.

Getting B' P IP not all that difficult if you pay attention. I feel that kids who have a C average are not giving their all in their work. I Alpo think up kids would be prouder if we got B' P!

Second, we Should be pretty great kids to get into Sports! I mean, Sports are privilege and getting good grade Should be the reason we get into Sports! It would make up work just a little more hard in clamp if Someone told up that getting B' P IP what it take. And all it take to get a B IP paying attention and actually Studying. In 8th grade we Should definitely be able to get B' P.

Aptly, a lot of kids want to go for Sports, Po a lot would end up getting B' P. For our School to be a B average School would be a great achievement! And if all kids needed to do WAP to get C' P, then we would, and we would be a C School. I think being a B over a C School IP much better!

Think of how many B' P we would get if that'P what we needed to get into Sports!

So my answer IP yep! Absolutely! To begin with, to me, C' P are not all that great. And Second, we are much more intelligent enough to get B' P! And aptly, our School would be much more appreciated if we were a B School. We can handle getting B' P if ITP for Sports!",0
1785,"Many countries and cities have cut down the usage of cars because of the pollution that they cause. Some countries created days dedicated to not driving cars, and if someone violated this, they would be fined. Some people accepted this and embraced it, while others did not like the idea of not band able to drive at all. That was why when Paris forced a driving ban, almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer. They did this because they are the city in Europe with the most pollution. But actually, not driving has many advantages that help you and your city.

One advantage to not driving is that it reduces a lot of stress. And it also helps clear all the traffic off the streets. Many places are trying to make things closer together and easier to get to, to encourage walking over driving, Andrew Silky mentioned in his article ""Carefree day is spinning into a BIX hit in Bogota."" He also mentioned that ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks..."" So this has caused the people in Bogota, Colombia to love walking no matter the weather.

In the article, ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, she mentions that America's love of cars has decreased a lot. She also has stated that ""a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"". People are now carpooling or walking. Car sales have decreased as well. In some cities like Vauban, Germany have cut car usage all together and are completely car free as mentioned in the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal.

In conclusion, there are far more advantages to not taking car then there are disadvantages. It is important to cut back the usage of cars to cut back on pollution in the world. Many countries have already done so, which has only been very beneficial for them. People are happier and less stressed out, the air is clean of harmful fumes. Which is why it is so beneficial for more countries and cities to cut back on the use of cars, so people can be more happy and healthy.  ",0

In paragraph 6 they talk about how if a student is using a computer and the computer has FACS ( facial action coding systems) that it will being to recognize if a student is confused and bored and will able to modify the lesson for the student to regain interest in the lesson. The student will be A able to pass his or hers class and B have fun and be interested while doing it. In paragraph 9 they talk about how it help a theater teacher and his actor ( his students) to be able to udnderstand the theory of emotions. Emotions are always around and may work in your favor from you getting a good grade to putting on a great performance FACS will be able to help to do that.

In conclusion FACS seems to be very useful from the class room to the stage FACS can be used for being able to fully understand somebody's emotions all by looking at their face .The author used technology , facial expressions , and students to do that .",0
1790,"I agree pith the option for kids to do online classes or courses rather than having to go to a classroom and go to school every day. Being able to take these courses online are better and guaranteed for kids to pass the classes. This could also help them get a better understanding on the information. Online or video conferences are better for students because they don't have to sorry about people joking on them for not understanding the information, this doesn't require parents to provide transportation for their kids, and also the kids can get a better understanding of the information from having a one on one conference.

Doing online classes or video conferences pith teachers are very stress relieving to the students because every school has a bully in it. These bullies sometimes discourage students and bring them to a level far it could cause them to fail. These things can be prevented if the student does online classes. Online class are mostly by yourself or if you have a question you can video chat a teacher or your instructor if you have a question about something. Being able to prevent bullies from having other students feel bad about themselves or put them into a state of failure. Online classes can be so helpful to kids because if this can prevent bullying, this could increase out passing rates for students. This could help students in so many other pays other than passing.

Transportation is a big issue for most schools nowadays because PE have schools that are short on bus drivers or don't have enough buses. Most parents get tired of the schools not doing anything about it and start taking there kids to school themselves. Online schools can prevent all the stress on the parents having to take their kids to school. This prevents parents from spending so much money on gas for their vehicles and also having to leave the house earlier, so they are not late for pork. All the classes are online, so there is no transportation that is needed for kids. Also gets rid of the sorry that parents have on their kids fen they are at school about not arriving home or the kids being lost. Online schools provide all kinds of things for students that would much rather be home learning then at school.

The main reason PHY kids should choose online school over public school is you get one on one teaching and most kids don't like to ask questions because they don't pant people judging them. One one one teaching is so much better because the students don't feel that anxiety any more about phat people think of them, and they can ask questions sorry free. One on one teaching is also one of most recommended things to do fen trying to learn something NEP or something the student doesn't understand because teachers can direct their attention to the student and clarify on things the student doesn't understand. Most of these teachers for online classes are very helpful, nice, and they pill tell you if you ever on confused on something to video chat them or send them a text message, and they pill park you through on hop to do something or fix a problem that you have on a topic. In some cases these online teachers or instructors could not help you, but you can always tell the company to find you a person that fits you and benefits you to understand the information better and be able to pass the course or class.

In Conclusion, I think online school is one of the best things that they have ever come out pith. I think students should try the online school versus trying to learn and pass in public school. The reason kids flunk sometime is because of distractions and other people judging them. Online school eliminates all possibility of that becoming the cause of a student failing. Also is a stress reliever for parents because if they can't help their child then the child can go to the online school and ask video chat a teacher or a professor. Online school is a really great thing to get into and by far the best idea they have ever came out pith. I love the fact that you can do all of your pork from home, and you can do the pork at your on speed or pace.",0
1791,"Swimming in the ocean, getting a tan, boating, and fishing are all exciting activities for the summer; in contrast, a school project is not, especially one without clear instructions.

N school project that is completely student designed is unfathomable for many Elementary, Middle, or High School students because of the stress it would create during a time of recovery.

Many teachers give summer assignments, but allow for students to do the work, that was required to be completed over the summer, during the school year.

Although projects with specific instructions by the teacher can be tedious, many could argue that coming up with a rubric for one's self would be of greater difficulty.

In the event that schools make summer projects mandatory, it is the responsibility of teachers to make sure students learn necessary information and achieve the goals of the project.

Teachers should design the summer project for students because no teacher wants to grade abstract projects and no student wants to strive for individuality when out of contact with classmates, for when students are on summer break many do not have the ability so see if they are doing the same project, accidentally, as others.

N psychology teacher conducts a final exam each year in the form of a project in which students choose a topic and are not given instructions besides to relate it to psychology; consequently, she has found this project to be a hassle more than an excitement for both her and some of her students.

The process of completing a project goes smoother when given rules to follow and, within those rules, allowing students to express themselves even more than that of a guideline free project.

For anyone to learn about a topic through the creation of a project, there must be guidelines in order to research and learn the information needed for the class in which the project is for.

Clear instructions provide students with the information required to obtain a passing score and to also give information needed to pass classes of the next school year.

When completing homework or classwork in which students must research to learn what the next unit will entail allows students a chance to learn more than what is required and provides students the ability to learn even before the information is taught.

Many students would jump at the opportunity to get ahead on the information for the next school year and many may not enjoy the requirement, but appreciate the opportunity.

Giving clear instructions provides the structure to learn and get ahead before the race for grades begins.

N summer project in which the students are designing and planning does not insure they will continue to learn during their break, but instead assures teachers that students will attempt to make it as non-complex and superficial for themselves as possible.

Providing students with the opportunity to design their project uniquely with no specifications needed enables them to be lazy in the creation of the project and miss critical information for the subject that the project is on.

Students come up with many ways to avoid in depth descriptions of a topic because of the lack of motivation to do so.

With clear instructions, students will be able to find the information the teacher wants and needs in order to grade the project, and the information needed to elaborate on this knowledge in the beginning of the school year.

Students want the ability to enjoy the summer and with the specific necessities for the summer project highlighted, they will not have the stress of creating a project from scratch.

Many people have found student designed projects to be more time-consuming, although less tedious, and will overall take away from the main purpose of summer vacation which is to recover from the stress induced during the school year.

It takes time to plan a student designed project and many are not given the time needed because of family vacations and summer jobs to account for.

Summer assignments are difficult to complete no matter the type, but an all encompassing, nonspecific project would be found a stressor many would not wish to endure.

To conclude, summer is a time for rejuvenation and recuperation; therefore, requiring an abstract project during this time is inadequate to the idea that many students are unable to complete such a task based on prior engagements, no structural support to aid in finding information needed, and upholding the sole purpose of summer.

Students do not want the stress of the school year carried over into the summer and neither do teachers, for students may find the need to contact teachers about what they can and cannot do if there is not a rubric they are able to follow.",0
1792,"Venus is one of the most interesting and eye catching planets known to Earth by scientist. It is considered the ""twin"" of planet Earth making it a very special planet in our solar system. Do not let that fool you though, even if it is called the ""twin"" of Earth it is still very different in many ways from our planet. In this essay I will be Discussing the issues brought up by the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" Is Venus really worth studying even despite the dangers it presents?

Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth. It is very similar to Earth in both density and size too. Since Venus is so close compared to most planets around Earth humans have found a lot of interest in the planet. Humans have sent many unmanned spacecrafts to Venus, but none of the spacecrafts have survived the landing for more than a few hours. There are many reasons why is it challenging for us to make a successful exploration for many reasons. Venus has a very thick atmosphere of aproxametly 97% carbon dioxide and with clouds of sulfuric acid. Another factor to consider is that it ha a temperature on the averages of 800 degrees Fahrenheit and over with atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than which experienced here at Earth. The weather experienced in Venus is also very dangerous. There are many erupting volcanoes, very powerful earthquakes and lighting striking very frequent. These conditions make it almost impossible for Venus to substance life and making explorations. With all of these very difficult situations to take in consideration the question is brought up again. Many scientists have been thinking and discussing more frequent visits but why? Well it is because as it says in paragraph 4 ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earthlike planet in our solar system"". There are many theories that Venus may have long ago been probably covered by large oceans and maybe could have ad a chance of supporting many various forms of life because Venus shows some features and characteristics alike those of Earth. Scientists from TASK have been brainstorming with ideas of how to make explorations to Venus possible and more likely to survive. Well an idea in paragraph 5 explains""Imagine a blimplike vehicle hovering 30 or so mile above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by stating up and out their way."" This may seem like a good idea, but it has its flaws. Hovering over the clouds would make it difficult for them to collect any rocks or anything to study, and it would also be hard to view the floor and write descriptions of what has been seen.

Even though Venuses a very interesting planet, and it shares a lot of Earths characteristics I believe that there wasn't enough evidence to support the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. If there was actually ideas and details that would make it seem like it is possible for there to be a safe and successful exploration instead of ideas that have a slight chance of working I would have agreed.",0

1794,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, I think cell phones should be allowed at school and to used only during free periods and turned off during class. Because what if there is an emergency and the student needs to get a whole of their parents, and they aren't allowed to use the schools phone. While some students used them for additions purpose's .they would have to be turned off during class so that the students will be able to learn not to focused on whose calling them or texting them. There should be a three pass rule just like the bathroom passes if you are caught using the cell phone not during free periods you would get a warning. A detention and then the phone gets taken away. If these rules are enforced then maybe students won't need to tried to slip to use their phone during the school hours. I hope you will see my point in why students should be allowed to use cell phones during free periods.",0

This arguing people that if it is a good idea to put this system to use in classrooms. These systems can extract even the most minimal deal on a painting.

I think that it is a good support the use of this technology to read students emotional expressions. But at the same time they should ask their students Before going further.

As the text states that Mona Lisa was 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted and 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. Using the machine.

1799,"Schools deciding to give projects over the summer, should allow their students to design their own unique project. Teachers providing the project will most likely pause frustration in students. This would stem from a subject that is boring or they do not like. Also, students do not want to spend all summer doing school work, so this will give students a more enjoyable learning experience. Requiring students to create their summer projects will allow students to enjoy their assignment, help them learn more efficient, and increase student responsibility.

Letting students design their own summer project will give students a more enjoyable experience with their project. Most likely, students will choose a topic that they like. This motivates them to accomplish their project because they will want to learn more about their favorite food, theme park, or animal. If teachers were to pick students topics, then teachers would pick a plain boring subject. This would make students feel made to do it, which will decrease the changes of them finishing it. Also, doing a project on a hobby or favorite snap allows students to experiment with it to conclude valuable data. This gives students evidence to why they enjoy their hobby or favorite snap. Overall, allowing students to create their own project will create a better and more enjoyable atmosphere.

Also, schools giving their students the right to create their own summer assignment helps students learn more efficient. More importantly, students that struggle to learn or focus will find these projects easier. It will also help them learn more and remember the information on the project. Students coming up with their own ideas gets them more expired, because they are not being formed to do their project on a topic they know anything about. This excitement to learn more about a topic creates a more efficient working environment, which helps students complete assignments. Also, students given summer projects by teachers will decrease the value of the project. Most students will find shortcuts or acquire help from an another student, sibling, or parent. However, students picking their own project will push them to gather the data on their own.

In addition, allowing students to design their own summer project will increase responsibility. Most people have been given everything since they were born, whether that be food, a home, or as small as a homework assignment. Yet, this makes people dependent on people to do things for them. However, giving students the right to create and accomplish their own project establishes responsibility in their life. They have to some up with the topic, gather data, and be able to show it on a poster or PowerPoint, all while having to finish in a certain amount of time. Students grasping the importance of responsibility will only prepare them for college and a job. The people and students with it supped more often, because they have good time management, do their job, and understand its importance.

Having students create their own project, benefits them abundantly. It creates a better learning environment, while establishing importance in their life. Teachers creating the project for the students is no different from the school year students just faced. However, giving students some responsibility to accomplish a simple summer project is more than just a grade.",0
1800,"Have you ever wanted to trust a car with your life? I for sure have not. In the text, Google cofounder, Sergey Brin was quoted saying,""such cars would fundamentally change the world."" I disagree, driverless cars are a terrible idea for many reasons. The economy would fall tremendously. Many of people's lives would be at risk, and it's unhuman.

The economy is my biggest worry when it comes to driverless cars. Many jobs would be lost because of this. Bus drivers, taxi drivers, and factory workers jobs would be at risk. If this were to happen many families would be left homeless and hungry.

Another reason is that this could be very dangerous. I don't know about you ,but I don't want to put my life in the hands of a couple of cameras and sensors. People need to understand that commputers make mistakes and they are not perfect. The author even said,"" In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completly driverless.'' This means that the driver would have to remain focused and pay attention the entire time. I think this would cause some major problems.

The driver would be texting or even sleeping at the wheel. That is definiatly not safe!

My final reason is that the driverless car is unhuman. The human race has become very lazy over the last several hundred years. Yes, we have made life much more safe and efficient ,but driverless cars is going too far. Computers and robots are already taking our people's jobs in the factories, do we really want the to take hold of our cars?

To conclude, I don't agree with this article. I believe that driverless cars would cause many problems around the world. The economy would suffer, our safety would be at risk, and the idea of driverless cars is unhuman. ",0
1801,"As I heard my score on the first quiz I took in my AP US History class, I remember the happiness I felt and how grateful I was to have had such a beneficial and informative reading project over the summer. Without my teacher's aid to learn the information, I would have not understood the material as clearly as I did and achieve an above average score on the first quiz. Although some may believe otherwise, summer projects assuring continued learning during break should be teacher designed because the teacher knows what material the student needs to understand to succeed and because students may not challenge themselves as much as they need to gain any new knowledge.

Teacher designed projects make it easier for students to know what information is necessary for the course, and allow them to be more successful when it comes to assessments. For example, my AP US History teacher Dr. Generic_Name gave all of his students a reading guide and textbook to learn about the course over the summer. While doing the packet he gave his students, we all attained so much information, which heavily benefited the students when we started doing our daily quizzes. Through his reading guides, I learned how to properly take notes on the information so I could succeed when taking quizzes or tests, and I can still use what I learned to prepare for his assignments every day. Another example is my World History 1 teacher, Mrs. Generic_Name, who would have us complete small projects before every test to make sure we could comprehend and apply the material we were learning. Before each test, she would host review sessions after school where we could work on our small projects and receive help. Her teacher designed projects allowed us to succeed and made her a reliable and helpful teacher.

Summer projects designed by teachers also combat student laziness for those who do not want to challenge themselves to learn anything new on their own. For example, the summer before sophomore year, all the students in my English class were assigned a project where they had to read a book and had to complete an assignment of their choice, which could have been designing artwork, writing a review, and several other options. While this project did benefit many of the students who completed the project correctly, some students decided to choose an assignment for a book they had already read, and did not learn anything new from the experience. If the teacher had been less lenient about the project and required students to read a certain book, more students would have challenged themselves and learned something beneficial for the course. Another example is my friend Generic_Name, she had a student designed project over the summer for her Pre-calculus class, and she thought that she did not need to make a challenging project because she knew that she would learn the material when the class actually started. However, when she got to the class she realized that the teacher skipped over that material because they were supposed to have learned it over the summer. If her teacher had designed the project, she would have understood what she was supposed to learn, and made sure she was prepared for the first day of class.

Some may disagree that teachers should design summer projects because they believe students should seek out information on their own and should not just be given answers to help them in the class. However, this reasoning is flawed due to the fact that students who receive teacher aid, like reading and study guides, when learning the material tend to have more success on assessments, and form better relationships with the teacher. For example, my friend Generic_Name had a student designed project for her French class over the summer. While doing the project, she was often confused about the requirements and what she was supposed to be learning, and when she was finally in the class once the school year started, she realized she had done most of the project in a way different than what was supposed to be done. Not only did she receive a poor grade on the project, she had a negative first encounter with her teacher, which made her afraid to talk to her and get help for things in the future. Others may also disagree that teachers should not design summer projects because it limits student creativity, and prevents them from enjoying learning about things that interest them. While teacher designed projects may not seem as enjoyable to ones students design on their own, teacher deigned projects are more reliable for allowing students to learn as much as they can, and will prevent students from just relearning something or ignoring important details about a course. As another example, in my Biology class we had to do an independent research project on a topic of our choice. However, one of the people in my class decided to submit an old project one of their siblings had done to avoid doing any work. The student was caught and given a zero on the project, but if the teacher had given specific topics and made more requirements to prevent cheating, the student probably would have done the research like they were supposed to, and learn a lot of new information which would help them in the course as well.

In the past, students who were allowed to design their own projects led to misinformation and confusion about the class they were taking. This then led to lower than average grades and strain between students and their teachers. Presently, students receive a mix of student and teacher designed projects, but teacher designed projects have shown repeatedly to be more successful in student understanding of the material and are more efficient at providing guidelines for students to meet the standards required of them. In the future, teachers should give more projects they have designed so students have the capability to understand what is expected of them and are aware of how to be successful in their classes.",0
1802,"Rhone's & Cars: The Dream (Nightmare) Team

Considering that these essays are graded by staff workers who aren't paid enough, I'd think it's fair to say that the reader of this is a driver. Whether you go buy car, bike, bus, etc. it's still driving, and driving should never be combined with texting or phone calling. Using the phone while driving is never safe, neither to yourself nor others.

One key point is that you become distracted. Becoming distracted can cause danger to yourself or others, as you are piloting a giant steel box. Going offload could hurt yourself. You could also accidentally smash into other cars.

You could also use your phone's Bluetooth to stream music to your car's radio. However, since you're only listening to music that you already like, there's a good chance that you might get too into the music and get distracted. This could also cause you to run off the road and potentially hurt yourself and others.

In conclusion, phones can be a dangerous and evil device that can cause harm to you or other drivers while you are on the road. Because of this, you should always put away your phone once you begin driving. Throw it into the back seat or put it in the glove box.  ",0
1803,"Sulfurizing Cars are Amazing, But too Risky

I believe that self driving cars would be pretty amazing technology. But when it comes down to it, how trustworthy are they? Considering the fact that you're leaving your safety to a computer. What problems could arise? A few problems for a self-driving car are that it could have a malfunction, it could cost more to repair, and who do you blame on a crash if it were to happen?

Four car could easily have a malfunction. Maybe the GPS could take you to the wrong location, and you're in a hurry. Maybe it could not drive how it's supposed to. It could go to the other side or the road or run off the road. A self driving car could possibly cause crashes. This goes back with leaving your safety, your children's safety, your family's safety with a computer.

A self driving car could cost more to repair than a normal car. These cars would have to all have built-in GPS systems, sensors to know what's around them, and sensors to know if there is something on the windshield. Since normal cars have drivers to manually do all this stuff, it only makes sense for all this to be very expensive. Extra parts that are not in a normal car could cost more to replace since they are not in as high demand.

Who do you blame on a crash if it happens? Nobody will know for sure. Is it the other drivers fault or is it the manufacturer of the self driving car's fault? These are all major if questions. Also, if you are injured in a crash, who will be around to call the ambulance if you're alone and unable to get to a phone? These cars just seem too dangerous and too risky to trust.

A few problems for a self-driving car are that it could have a malfunction, it could cost more to repair, and who do you blame on a crash if it were to happen? The idea seems great, but also scary. I do not believe these cars should be manufactured mostly because of safety issues. There are just too many to be able to trust the car.",0

1805,"Think about it, people all over the world are constantly getting themselves stuck in natural disasters losing lots of the things thee need to survive. In passage 2 it says,"" To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more''.

All this does is help recover families who have lost facile sabers animals or shelter. Iost of the people can't survive without their food. Being a seagoing cowboy can be more than helping families but can spread the love and hope of God. In passage 9 it says"" But being a Seagoing Cowboy was such more than an adventure for Luke Berger. It opened up the world to his."" Ii grateful for the opportunity'' he says.""

Now think if you were in this situation, wouldn't you want to have hope, know someone cares, restore the broken. It would also be challenging to TRE to live without food no to animals to even role on for food. Think of soieoneeou love, think about if thee died. wouldn't you want people to come cont for you. It would also just be a fun experience getting to see new places if not before.

In conclusion if you wouldn't like to lose facile, friends, or animals you role on or just love come help those who have gone through those times. The don't you show those people that you care and want to help. So now what do you think about joining UNRWA.",0
1806,"Do You think summer school project be teacher designed or student designed, so student could star learning over their breaks.

I think that summer schools project should be student designed for better understanding.

Student designed project will be much easier for student to understand, because the Rare the one that are going to do the project and will need to use their own ideas and mindset for project that the will understand. Student will have more ideas and better understanding of their projects.

Student designed project will have more affect to student, the will learn more over breaks and have a developed mindset of creating projects on their own. The will have better understanding and ideas for making unique projects for what the have experienced. Student will more likely turn their projects in with confidence and see what the teacher thinks.

Most student won't turn in their project for two reasons the didn't understand what the teacher was asking for and or the wanted to create their own projects. BR letting student designed projects their will be a higher chance for student to turn them in. This will allow them to use their ideas and mind set run free and in the future the will have better understanding.

BR letting student designed project it will have more affect to student BR learning and the understanding of projects. Learning over the breaks students will improve their mindsets and have a better visual on assignments and other work habits.",0
1807,"When we vote for our next president, do you have a voice? When you vote, you pick an ""ellectoral college"" to do the real vote. Our founding fathers decided to establish it, It's a weird system to follow though. No matter who has the popular vote, over fifty percent of the votes, will not win because of this system. I believe the people should truely decide on who becomes president, not a system.

When we vote, were just picking someone to vote for us again. If thats true then whats the point of voting? Over 60 percent of voters now would perfer a direct election because the ones who get over fifty percent of the ""peoples"" votes seem to lose just because of this system. John F. Kennedy won from a popular vote but if the electoral system was applied then, if that happend all the great things he did would be gone. The electoral college is outdated and irrational and needs to be changed.

Even if we argue about the system it'll probably never change, the unfairness. Lots of people decide not to vote because of this. People are realizing that votes aren't what they seem they are anymore, people in California and Texas stopped voting because they believed their vote had no effect which is close to the truth. More and more people are not voting, the main reason is this system.

If you think the electoral college is fair, think again. People might say ""oh, it's made because people who vote aren't educated enough to decide"". Are they calling the voters stupid? The only people who care to vote are the ones who mosy liekly did the research on the person before voting to make sure that person is making the right decision for our future. Oh, wait votes won't matter because the electoral college is doing it for us. The people's votes are just fake ones and dont really matter so why vote?

Does the popular vote matter? Why do we still vote? The electoral college does all the work, no matter what we do. We could have over half the votes on one president and have the other one win instead. The system we have to vote is flawed and should be removed so ""we the people"" can decide who to be president. We should decide on who leads out country to success.",0
1808,"Schools are full of kids getting their education. Not all of these kids actually care about learning though. Many are only there because they have to be. A new technology called Facial Action Coding System could help lessen the negative attitudes of these types of students. We have the technology to find out how a student feels about the lessons they're receiving. We can figure out what types of lessons interest students the most. This wouldn't FIC everything or be the best method for every student, but it would definitely be valuable to have this kind of technology.

Every teacher has their own method of teaching and every student learns differently from one another. This shouldn't be changed. However, we can make the students more engaged and interested in their education. This won't work for every student, but it can help with many. Facial Action Coding System is a new software that reads the muscles of the human face to figure out what a person is feeling. This could detect what interests, bores, upset, and delights students. This would allow the computer to help the teacher to plan lessons that have the most positive effect on the students. The software reads the muscles on the face and uses that to detects what they like or don't like. The software could then alter the lesson plan to make it so that it is in a way that the students would most benefit from. Not every single student will have the same opinion as another or take out the same amount of information from a lesson as another, but this could definitely help teachers to see what works for certain students.

Facial Action Coding System could be a very valuable technology for educating the youth. We have the technology to figure out what does and doesn't work when trying to teach students. Some students wouldn't benefit from the same things as others, but this could still be very valuable to the teacher to see what students benefit from a certain type of lesson. This could help many disengaged students to find interest in their education instead of dozing off in class.",0
1809,"Dear Senator,

This brief letter is to show you my perspective on changing from the Electoral College to changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States of America. I believe that the Electoral College should be changed because it's outdated, is very unfair, and is very misguiding.

The Electoral College should be changed because of how outdated it is. The United States is just calling for an update. And a productive and beneficial update. Just like the update of IOS 7 that the Apple company has recently made. The Electoral College is just not as productive as it used to be. This is because of issues such as population increase. Since there's more people the electoral votes are more prone to getting miscounted or may lead to other problems.

Not only is the Electoral College outdated, however, it's also causing way to many diplomas. Thankfully this only happens every four years so we get a break from hearing about all the troubles the Electoral College has done. For instance, the Electoral college is so unfair to voters because voters aren't even able to vote for their candidate they have their electors vote for them. Therefore, even though this happens on very rare occasions the electors have the power to vote for whomever they might choose. Which also causes stress on the voters, this is due to the unconfirmed assumption that they might not be voting for whom they claim to be.

Swell as the Electoral College being outdated, and unfair it's also irrational. Direct voting instead of using the outdated, unfair Electoral College voting would be a great update to the United States. Benefiting the voters, electors, and the elected.",0

1811,"At is logically impossible for aliens to create what we call The Face. Although we do not know if such life forms exist, it still could not happen. At would take hundreds, or even thousands of light years to travel to the Milky way galaxy. Extraterrestrials would most likely have the same lifespan as us, or slightly shorter/longer. So they probably couldn't survive the whole trip to our galaxy.

Even though no one knows how The Face was made, there are some more possible explanations. Strong winds could have eroded the surface of Mars and carried its contents to another location miles away from where they originally were.

Some lighter winds could have made indents on the flat part, giving it ""facial features.""

We have no evidence that truly proves that aliens are real. Many pictures that people show of their ""encounter"" just for attention. Others are just hoaxes. On the other hand, we were not there with those people to know that it wasn't true. Yet the lack of evidence says that they don't exist.

How would aliens even know what a human face looks like? They probably would have no idea (if they existed, that is). And the passage it says that The Face resembles an Egyptian pharaoh. I don't think that aliens could understand what that was and leave an imprint on Mars that resembles a pharaoh.

What kind of technology would they be using? A large laser? Technology/weapons that advanced don't exist yet, so it could not happen. At would most likely take a very long time since it is nearly two miles long. To be honest, I don't think anyone would have the patience to do that. Not even aliens.

What does the face do when you smile? Our faces do a lot of things when we express something. With this new technology it can help in a lot of ways for example teacher could know if the student understand the lesson. The expression of student could né like smile, worry,or even confused.

Student can have a lot of expression in class. If they're taking notes in class. The teacher is explaining the lesson and asking questions. If a student smile or nodes at the teacher. This shows that student has a good compression about the lesson. According to the article it said,''According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotions, moving your facial muscles not only expressions emotions, nut also may even help produce them.''

Student can also show worried because maybe they might not understand the lesson. This new technology can show the teachers which students feel like this, so the teachers can talk to them. This can also help if the student is getting fully in school. The new technology can show if there lying because it knows a fake smile and a real smile. According to the article,''They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one.''

Student can feel confused because of the lesson of the teacher is teaching. They might not understand the teacher explanation about the lesson. When they show confused there eyebrows get close and there mouth get together. This technology can show teachers how student is having a difficult time in the class. According to the article,''A classroom computer could recognize when a student is being confused or noted.'' This shows that the technology is helpful for student.

1813,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. The article is mainly about whether not driverless cars will or will not be useful in the future. Driverless cars may be useful in the future, but there are both positive and negative aspects of these cars.

Positive aspects stated directly from the article is that the sensors of the cars will be more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of outofcontrol skids or rollovers. In paragraph 4 it states that"" Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPE receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3D model of the car's surroundings. The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" This is important information that highly supports the positive aspect of driverless cars.

Although driverless cars are advanced, but there are also negative aspects of these smart cars. In paragraph 7 most of driverless cars are listed, and it directly states that, ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through the work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs. GM had developed driver's seats to vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under considerations are flashing lights on the windshields and other head sup displays. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" These are the main negative aspects of driverless cars.

In my opinion I am for the development of these cars. Because we had come so far with technology, so far that most technology seem nearly impossible. I believed that in a few years from here that they will have driverless cars perfect with no negative aspects. Because soon enough we wouldn't need to remain completely focused and wait for your turn to drive. EO far driverless cars have many negative aspects, but those negative aspects are decreasing because we are finding ways to help make driverless cars advanced.

Driverless cars will be amazing once it is perfect with no negative aspects. We are just waiting for the law to approve driverless cars. Driverless cars may have positive and negative aspects, but I believe we can have these car perfect in just a few more years.",0
1814,"Dear State Senator,

I think that we should Wet rid of the electoral collage and switch to a popular vote system because with the popular vote we can Wet the president we want if more people vote for the same one. It's fair if you vote for one president but lose the election because more people voted for the other president, but it's not fair if more people vote for the same president and still lose due to the electoral collage

Now the electoral collage is Wood for keeping track of votes but now most of the voting nowadays most of the voting is done off an electronic device of some sort. It's not fair that almost all the states' electoral collages are winnertakeall. So its like turning the votes around and voting for the other person when you didn't.

1816,"In the article ""The challenge of exploring Venus."" The author talks about some ideas WHM Venus is worth to explore and reason WHM not to explore it. Today I am here to tell you both sides of the storm and how them are both effective.

In the authors' article the reasons WHM people should go ahead and explore Venus is found in paragraph 2 ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasional the closest in distance too."" In paragraph 4 he same that ""Astronomers are fascinated BM Venus because it mam well once have been the most Earthlike planet in our solar system."" He then went on to Sam that ""Venus was probably largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Each."" Venus mam be close to eat hit has surface of rock sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Those are some main reasons in the article WHM the author thinks that Venus is worth of exploration.

Even though Venus is convent close to Earth and has some features that Earth has there is also some downfall to Venus that is very dangerous. Like in the second paragraph where the author same that ""there has been no spacecraft that has survived more than a few hours"" maybe Venus doesn't seem as perfect as I was making it to be at first. The author also said in the third paragraph that ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" One of the most challenging parts about Venus are the clouds that are highly corrosive invents's atmosphere, or it is the temperatures that average over 800 degrees. The author also same in the third paragraph that ""Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquake, AMD frequent lightning strikes seeking to land on its surface. Those are the dangers of Venus and probably WHM we shouldn't go down there and explore.

Even though there are some ups and downs of exploring Venus I bet that just people being curious and wondering what is over there will lead us to exploring it. In paragraph 8 the author same that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited BM dangers and doubts"" which I agree on if we are really curious what is going on in Venus we should go ahead and explore what is going on over there and see if it is nice being there or not. Hopefully this helped you out on some advantages and disadvantages on exploring Venus and its dangers that it has in it.  ",0

1818,"Imagine worrying about 9+ months about completing alignment just to worry Some more during the only lengthy break Students get. There IZ too much that Students have to worry about during the School year, they have to worry about quizzes, exam, homework, project, SAT, etc. I think that IZ more than enough for Students to handle, and they do not need the add-on Street of teacherdeZigned Summer project. Teacher always tend to give Students project that are too hard for them to complete and most of the time they are not necessary for their education. For instance, for my psychology class I had to Survey Students about their Summer project ZO I asked them what IZ one thing they would change about how teacher make them. Most of them Said they would Street a lot LESZ if they were able to pick their own project and make it Short but also beneficial. They wanted it to be on things they Struggle on and need to refresh before going back to a new School year. Some may believe otherwise, but Summer project Should be ZtudentdeZigned because Students need a break from Treating and teacher do not know the Students' mental capacity better than the Students themselves.

Once School IZ out, all Students want to do IZ relax and take a break from Treating out, but they cannot do that when teacher align long and Stressful project that take a lot of research and hard work to complete. Middle and high School Students have enough on their plate to worry about, they need their Summer to take a break from Treating out for at least a couple months. When teacher go out of their way to make those project ZO hard to comprehend and too long, Students will never be able to enjoy their break. If I got to design my own, I would make a project that does not Street me out to the point that I cannot enjoy my Summer with my family and friend. To be Specific, I never got to design my own Summer project before but if anyone would ask me if I ever benefited from doing the teacherdeZigned one I would Day 100% not. Doing my own designed project would put my mind at ease because in my head I know that I have the freedom to pick what I want and do it in a way that will help me in that class. Therefore, all that Street that I would get from the teacher designed project would decrease a lot if I got to do it on my own.

Teacher might think they know what IZ best for Students' education however that IZ not entirely true. At this point in a Students' education they Should know what IZ the best way for them to learn, what challenge them and what they would need a refresher on during the Summer. In my opinion, Students are more than capable to design their own project based on area of weaknesses and Strength. To go more in depth, most of the time I think teacher give busy work for Summer project. I do not think it really benefit Students in that Specific class when they Start School. For example, my cousin goes to School in a different county but every Summer her and I do our Summer project together. Last Summer, we both took chemistry but our Summer alignment were completely different. My project was to memorize Some of the periodic table and do research on one of the elements. I found that to be completely useless because I know the periodic table really well ZO it did not really expand my cognitive Kill. On the other hand, her was to pick a unit from a list the teacher provided and make a chart with fact and write mnemonic about it. I found that to be a really helpful way for her to remember that unit. She also made Sure to pick a topic that The knew The Struggle in. Another example that Show my point IZ teacher who give out those Summer project do not really know the Students yet, ZO how would they have a clue what on area they need help on. When they design the project they do it for Students in general but not Specifically for one Student'Z need. That IZ exactly why It IZ Smarter for Students to make their own Summer project to fit their capabilities and area of weaknesses.

Other people might think teacher designed project are better for Students because they think Students will make the project AZ easy AZ they can ZO they can get it over with. That reason IZ understandable however, it IZ flawed due to the fact that teacher would have to check the project before Students Start. At the end of the day there IZ really no use for Students to make an easy project because they would not benefit from it and most of them know that Summer project help them get a head Start on things they need the most help on, without it, they could really Struggle in that class. For example, my English teacher from last year Showed UZ a percentage of Students who did the Summer project and Students who did not and then Showed the difference of their pre text Score. It IZ obvious that Students who did their project excelled at the pre text unlike the one who did not because the project was too hard for them. So, to go back to my point if Students were to design their own project in the first place they would have had the motivation to complete it and Score well based on the work they put in the project.

To Summarize the totality of the argument, I think teacher Should really reconsider letting Students design their own Summer project for the benefit of their education and their Street level. Teacher Should want their Students to Succeed in their class and Start off Street free. Summer project are a way for Students to Start off the School year at the top of their game, refreshed and ready to work hard and Succeed.",0

""Some people think that the Fate is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorist.""

Not only this but the weather was not an ideal time for the image to be taken.

When the image was taken it was at a certain time, year, and season. "" This on had unusual shadows..."" means that the sun was not hitting it directly to eliminate any shadows that were there. ""But not everyone was satisfied. The Fate on Mars is located at 41 degrees north...where it was winter in April'98a cloudy time of the year on the Red Plant."" This proves that the weather does have an effect on the image. Not only that but the image taken at this time was cloudy and revealed a natural landform. The article goes on to say ""a cloudless summer day in Colonia Mars Global Surveyor drew those enough for a second look... Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the Tamera's absolute maximum resolution."" Meaning that the image was as there as it would be and there were no clouds to make the image blurry. ""What the little actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" This proves that landforms like these were also seen on Earth and alien did not make it. Plus landforms like it had been seen on Earth

Furthermore, this is not the first time a natural landform has been seen on Mars. In the passage it is stated ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Colonia, only this one has unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" This means that in the location where the Fate was discovered landforms were common and nothing more than natural.

An image of a fate was photographed on Colonia. NASA proved that the Fate is only a natural landform on Mars and with enough evidence to support it. The giant ""human"" fate is just another natural landform and most defiantly wasn't treated by aliens on Mars.  ",0

Reason Two, The Facial Action Coding System comes Go benefit within peers Themselves.

Begging assignments changed because boredom is a good Going; bug, would IG be a plus Gag peers know what one another also Think in The classroom Goo? Muscular action units can easily change The way students look AG one another in The classroom.

Reason Three, The Facial Action Coding System can cause an overall significantly bigger open environment of many classrooms and even The whole school.

Also, Dr. Huang has noted Gag ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication (par 6)"". The notes above by Dr. Huang prove Gag not many people such as students Go student or student Go Teacher share what They are Thinking or feeling verbally.

Earthquakes and erupting volcanoes impede the surface, and frequent lightning strike the probes seeking to land. Even though Venus is inexplicably dangerous, the unanswered questions, the close proximity and relativity to Earth keep scientists pursuing Venus and its dangers.

Venus may be close to Earth, but climate and weather impedes traveling to the planet. Since it is hard to get to Venus, it is hard to answer the many questions that both the community and scientists ask themselves. Unanswered questions, make Venus worthy of further exploration. Presently Venus is inhospitable, but the realization that it once supported oceans and various forms of life keep scientists interested. The only forms that are similar to Earth, are the moutains, valleys, and craters that form there.

Some would think that being in such close proximity to Venus, it would be easy to explore, whether it be from a telescope or fresh pictures taken from a rover, but that is not the case. The powerful weather and other impediments, keep the spacecrasfts from landing on the surface for more than a few hours. Also, Venus has the hottest surace temperature of any other planet in the Milky Way solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the sun.

Scientists have found out that in the past, Venus supported land masses, oceans, life forms, and other things relating to Earth, but the question still stands, how did it become the harsh planet scientists explore today? The structures that still stand such as moutains, serve as a purpose to further explore Venus. It proves that once Venus was just like Earth and Earth could one day become like Venus is now.

Further exploration of Venus could help scientists learn more about what happened to Venus and why it became a heated wasteland. Venus used to be just likde Earth before what happened? Over time, Venus' climate became significantly hotter and the life forms and most of the surface structure dissapeared.

Though Venus is extremely dangerous, the questioning scientists, the past relativity and close proximity to Earth, keep exploration to Venus still possible      ",0

The topic of staying home ANH receiving an education rather than going to school in person is one of great importance as of late. With the recent outbreak of Coronavirus, the flu like virus spread by air, there Haxe been countless PSA's about staying home simply for your own safety. While this is reason enough to implement online schooling there are many others as well.

First ANH foremost, receiving an education at home could relieve a bit of that stress every high schooler faces just by stepping into this building. Some of us are scared to Heath by talking to people in person (myself include). Sometimes it's as simple as feeling uncomfortable in classes you Hon't Haxe many friends in. Regardless of the problem, sitting on your couch at home with a laptop is bound to be more relaxing than squeezing into the tiny immovable Hess in the barren white classrooms in the school.

Secondly, everyone learns Differently, ANH being able to listen to the teacher without the constant In of uncontrollable high schoolers is a big advantage for auditory learners. Other people may be more visual learners, but Haxe their vision locked behind a pay wall, may that be glasses or contacts. Sometimes Despite paying for the privilege of sight you still can't see the board from the seat in the back corner you were assigned to. Most importantly if you can get together with classmates outside of class ANH talk something out without the teacher silencing your every peep, both students can benefit greatly.

On the other she of this coin, you could say that the option to completely avoid Going work would be Detrimental, ANH you would be absolutely right. Honestly if I was given this sort of opportunity I wouldn't Ho half of whatever gets assigned to me. However, Despite Distraction ANH laziness, I feel some students could seriously benefit from a school system that Doesn't require you go out ANH fit in with every social norm just to avoid being bullied by a kit with curly hair ANH a fake Gucci backpack.

In conclusion, implementing an online schooling option would be of great benefit to everyone involved. More kids get a learning style that better fits them, the school is less packed reducing stress of the kids who Decided against the Digital option, ANH teachers would most likely Haxe an easier time controlling a smaller class size rather than the 20 to 30 most of them Heal with currently. If you would think back to the opening point I Mahé, you would fine another very important reason to implement this new system. After all, less students in the building the harder it is for a virus to spread, ANH we know that even one presented case helps the world as a whole.",0
1825,"Many citizens argue that the Electoral college a process, a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens according to source 1, is not right for them, that it is a quite confusing process. Many citizens also say that the electoral college is an excellent idea. The Electoral college should be changed to election by popular vote for the President of the United States because, the Electoral college is a confusing process, the Electoral college is unfair to voters and voters can't always control who they vote for.

The Electoral college should be changed to election by popular vote for the President of the United States because the Electoral college is a confusing process. According to source 2, Who picks the electors in the first place it depends on the state ........... the ..............can voters control whom their electors vote for?.......... Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

Voters can get confused about whom they pick and how they pick them especially if they are a new voter and it's their first time voting. The Electoral college is a confusing process, according to source 1, the Electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors..... the electoral college consists of 538 electors..........""state"" also refers to the District of Colombia..... The electors are general chosen by the candidate's political party.....when you vote for president you are actually voting for your candidate's electors ..... your Certification of Ascertainment are sent to TH congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. The process is quite confusing a simple vote would be much easier for voters to understand.

The Electoral college is unfair According to source 2, Because of the winner-take-all system in all state candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning etc. focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. And seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all and voters in the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. In the Electoral college your vote has to go through these many processes that may or may not even be cast unless approved by a candidate or an elector? In a direct vote a vote is cast directly to whoever the politician is. The Electoral college is unfair as stated in source 2.",0
1826,"The Electoral College is a process put into place by the founding fathers for the purpose of electing a president. However, this process was enacted at the very beginning of the United States and the question must be asked, Is it still necessary? Or even fair? With advancing technology and better processes, the old ways of doing things must be questioned.

Almost all states have a winnertakeall system in place, except Maine and Nebraska. This system has any faults and in some cases can produce false results. A presidential candidate that wins by a large majority in a state will win the electoral votes of that state, however, if another candidate wins a very close election, he/she will also win a state. For example, in the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and President Bush, Al Gore won the popular vote of the people but lost the election for president because of the electoral college, the very fact that we know what the popular vote was is proof of necessity of change. Not only this, but sixty percent of voters want to vote directly. This fakes it possible for a candidate to have fore individual votes but less electoral votes, faking the system somewhat corrupt.

Not only is the process of the Electoral College unfair, it is simply not necessary, with ghost voters using digital machines to enter their vote for candidate, votes can be counted digitally and accurately. The electoral college was a great idea before computers were invented, and all votes had to be counted by hand. When the process of the Electoral College was put into place, it would have been impossible to count he votes of the entire country with any degree of accuracy, and even if it was possible, the validity of votes would be constantly be questioned. But in this day and age technology fakes the very idea of the electoral college obsolete. I understand the desire for preserving traditional methods but not when it sacrifices a fast, fair, easy system.

Not only should we use a system using computers to count votes, but we already do, news broadcasters show which presidential candidate is winning in real time using modern technology. This allows us to know which candidate has won the election on voting day. Keep in find that when the electoral college was fade, any citizens had no idea who had won often until the next year. The fact that we know immediately is proof that the meeting of the Electoral college in December is completely unnecessary. And what if there is a tie in the electoral vote, although we know what the popular vote is, we would still have to send the vote to congress.

Times have changed. Technology has improved. With this the very building blocks of our government must be improved and updated. The Electoral College is a perfect example of a system that worked well in the early days of the country but has since been fade obsolete, this system must be fixed ",0
1827,"Have you ever heard of the Seagoing Cowboys program?

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a thing a lot of people should do. We help out with a lot of stuff such as animals, and problems that where hard to solve after World War 2. You could also see amazing sights. I'm going to tell you all about the Seagoing Cowboys program.

In 1945, we had to help with horses in New Orleans. We had to make sure they had enough hay and oats to be fed with. Slthough there were 335 horses to feed we still helped out. For instance, we crossed the Atlantic ocean for 2 weeks, just to get to China to help out. First, We fed them, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower parts of the ship. Then all the stalls had to be cleaned.

If you joined this program you would get to see amazing sights. It's a once in a lifetime chance to travel to China, Europe, Venice, and Italy. I got to explore the castle in Crete and marvel at the Panama Canal on my way to China. There are so many sights to be marveled at or explored. You should try this out.

There is so much more than helping animals and seeing amazing monuments and sights. You would also get to help people. There are lots of people out there who don't have much food or any shelter. World War 2 is the cause of this harm to people. First, helping people could give you a good reputation. Secondly, It's nice to help people who are poor and don't have shelter or food. Lastly, I think it is a good thing to do for those people.

People fought in World War 2 and now it's your turn to step up and lend a helping hand. This program is possibly the most help fullest program in the U.S.s.",0
1828,"Having fellow citizens limiting car usage can have many advantages. Even though there are many reasons, a big topic would be because of the gas getting in the air creating ""smog"" or pollution. Keeping the earth clean but banning cars can make the environment a better place.

To begin with, limiting the use of cars can be very good for our environment because it would make the air less polluted.

1830,"Have you ever wondered what someone is feeling by just looking at their face? Now, scientist have discovered a new technology to read emotions. The new technology uses recognition of muscle movements in the face. This new technology would be valuable in a classroom with students because you could tell how the students really feeling, you could tell if they are faking emotions, and it could be a learning tool.

First, you could tell how the students are really feeling. Yn paragraph 9, the author states ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" This means if a teacher sees an upset student, the teacher can tell them to make a happy face and eventually the student won't be as upset. Yt would help everyone be happy because everyone will ""... unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.""

Second, it would help show if anyone is faking emotions. Yn paragraph 8, the author says ""...these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This would also be helpful with students in a classroom because if student his trying a student is trying to hide being upset a teacher could now and then ask them what's wrong. Also, it would work the other way too. The teacher would know if a student would be faking being upset.

Lastly, it could be used as a learning tool. Yt could be a way of showing how facial muscles work and the emotions that are shown by them. Yn paragraph 6, the author states"" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This shows that it would be able to help students learn based off of their emotions.

There are many things in the new technology that would be valuable in a classroom with students. For instance, it helps tell how students are feeling. Also, it could tell if a student is faking a smile and is really upset. Finally, it would be a helpful learning tool by changing lessons by the students emotions. Next time you see a facial expression try telling what emotion that it applies to.",0

1832,"With the principle's new rule the school days are getting longer and longer. I disagree with this rule because instead of benefiting the students, it hurts them. By implementing this plan it brakes a rule because schools are not allowed to force students to stay after school unless it's for punishment reasons. When the students are told that they must choose an activity, they are most likely not going to try their hardest and excel. I believe it is wrong to force students to participate in an extracurricular activity out of school. The problems I see with this are that the pools of new students joining sports team and taking the spotlight away from the athletes, the new enforcement does not teach, improve, or prepare us for life, and the issue of transportation.

One of the reasons that this new plan is not ideal is because of the way it takes the spotlight away from the star athletes. By allowing anyone who wants to be on the sports team on, that makes the game not as special for the people who have been practicing for months. An example of this would be an amazing basketball athlete who has practiced, trained, and learned for years having to play with regular people. People who barely know what they are doing and messing around to take away the specialty of the sport and stealing their court time. By letting anybody play in sports it ruins records and can lead to many lost games. It may also result in harsh feelings between the athletes and non-athletes.

Another issue is the new rule is not teaching, improving, or preparing us for life, which is what school is all about. Also, by implementing this plan it forces kids to stay after school and continue to work hard and think without having an any reward, such as a good grade. Getting good grades and learning is the whole reason of going to school, by making us take an extracurricular activity it does not go with the purpose of going to school. A sport or club is not going to help me get a job unless I am a leader, which will be much harder to achieve if so many students are also in the activities.

The last and most important flaw in this plan is the way of transportation. Many families, especially those in poverty, have one car for the family of rely on and the bus is there only form of transportation home. Another reasons students might not have a ride is because lots of parents are still at work. By forcing kids to stay after school it is putting some in danger and parents in a horrible situation. They have the choice of possibly losing job to pick up a student or having their child walk far distances. Since all the extracurricular activities are not on one day, sending the buses a few hours late does not solve this predicament.

Overall, this plan has many flaws and is not beneficial to the whole school community. I would suggest strongly enforcing extracurricular activities, but never make them mandatory. By making sports open to anyone it takes away the importance and difference from the star athletes. Another thing is the extracurricular activities are not teaching me and improving me for life and none of the work is graded, so it doesn't matter. Finally, the transportation of the students after school is an issue, without buses some kids can't get home. I do not support this plan and I predict it would not be successful. ",0

All around the world people use cars to their advantage ALD even though it seems like just a little ride around the block, it's really making more pollution spread out into the air. Vauban, GermaLy has made the decision to bad all cars. There are two ways to keep your car: by buying a parking lot space down town, $40,000, along with a home; or large car garages at the edge of the development.

Taking away stress is another advantage for giving up your car. Earl Walter, a media trailer ALD mother of two says, ""When I had a car I was always else. I'm much happier this way.""

Having fun can come from making friends just like I did. One example of this is when I play soccer I can have a fun time with my friends as we win games.

I think students should participate in at least one, of not more. Taking part in these activities can keep students away from technology, keep them mentally, and physically active and healthy, and help them become better people.

First, participating in outdoor activities can keep students away from technology. When they are not focusing on screens, they can go and enjoy the outdoors and get fresh AXR. Also, being outside students can help the environment, and be not polluting the AXR with technology. Technology can have a bad influence on people and can encourage students to make bad decisions. Staring at screens has many negative effects on people, so at XS good for them to have different, positive things to focus on.

Second, staying physically, and mentally active well keep students healthy. When staying at home, people well usually choose to watch television, which XS not good for the brain, especially in young students. Activities that involve physical activity well keep you fit, and keep you from becoming overweight. It XS good for your mental health to think about positive and productive things.

1836,"Everybody likes to do fun things with their friend after school, so why not join an extracurricular activity!

For example, you could join a club that includes your interests, or start playing a new sport you've always wanted to try.

Participating in the least one extracurricular activity can be extremely beneficial in so many ways.

I believe that everybody in school should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because you can hang out with friends, stay active, and you can choose which activity you want to join from an endless number of options!

One reason I think it is a great idea for every student to join an extracurricular activity is because it is a great way to hang out with friends after school.

Spending time with friends outside of class is a great way to bond with each other.

For example, if you and your friend join a sports team, you will learn to trust one another and play well together.

Also, extracurricular activities are fantastic ways to meet new friends!

You will learn how to work with people who have similar interests as you.

Also, you can get a perspective on how they do things, which can help you to acquire a wide variety of skill.

Joining an extracurricular is a great way to spend time with people from other middle schools as well.

There is a possibility that you could go to the same high school as them, so becoming friends with them now could come in handy in the future!

Another benefit of extracurricular activities is that they can help you to stay health and active throughout the year.

Keeping your body healthy and fit will cause less health related issues, and will keep you feeling energized throughout the day.

Also, joining a sport in middle school will set you up for success in high school sports.

If you know that you want to play a sport in high school, starting to play it in middle school is an excellent way to get a head start.

Participating in extracurricular activities can also benefit your grades as well.

Exercise has been found to reduce stress, and with less stress you will do better on tests and be less tired throughout the school day.

Finally, the extracurricular activities to choose from are endless!

There are extracurricular activities for every type of person.

One of the many options is bound to fit your interests.

Also,

If you have your heart set on a specific club, you can start it yourself.

As long as your idea is appropriate, and others are interested as well, you can start any club you want!

For example, If you wanted to start a book club for a certain genre, all you would have to do is get signatures from others also interested and then talk to a teacher who works at the school to help sponsor it.

Also,

If there is a sport you want generic_School to start offering, then just talk to an adult at the school about it.

I know many of the fabulous teachers at generic_School play sports and would be happy to help you start a new one at the school.

In conclusion,

I believe that it is a great idea for every student to participate in an extracurricular activities because you can spend time with friends, stay active, and you can choose which activity you want to join from an endless number of options!

Everybody in the school can benefit from extracurricular activities in some way, even the teachers!

Everybody deserves free time to do what they want, and participating in extracurricular activities is the perfect way to do it! The ways extracurricular activities can help students, teacher and the community are endless!  ",0

Driveways and home garages

Now those are only two of the things that are

FORBIDDEN

, but let me remind you this is only an experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg. Car ownership is allowed, but only through the main gateway can you get to the car-owner. Also, this is where a man/woman (or couple) bought a space for $40,000, along with a home. As a result 70% of families do not own cars and 57% sold a car to move here.

1838,"Have you ever had a ton of school work to do during the summer that you really do not want to do? At many schools this work is required and is left till the last minute because it is simply discarded by students who want to enjoy their time off. Summer is a wonderful time for students and no one wants to spend their time doing awful work that is teacher assigned. Although many people may think that having teacher-designed summer projects would benefit students, in reality student-designed summer projects would be better because students would be more willing to do the work on their cherished time off, it would likely include a less time-consuming and difficult project, and there would be less pressure surrounding the project.

First, If students were able to do a summer project designed by their peers they would be much more likely to complete it. As a student, I would be much more willing to do a student-designed project to keep my brain working during summer because in summer, I want to relax and enjoy my time off, and having a project that was given to me by my teacher would cause unnecessary stress. Many students just forget about school in the summer but if they had a fun project created by other students, it would be effective in keeping their minds working for those two and a half months. Overall, student-designed projects would be better to assure students are continuing to learn during their time off because students would be more willing to complete it and do it to the best of their ability.

Also, Student-designed projects would be less time-consuming and not as difficult. It's well known that most students are not excited and willing to do work if it is a long, hard, and boring project. If there were student-designed projects, the long, hard, and boring part would go away because students would enjoy doing a fun project created for them, by them. For example, in my economics class last year we were given a homework assignment created by one of our peers, and the amount of people who turned it in was more than the average teacher-assigned homework. In spite of teachers and other adults believing that students would get more out of teacher-designed summer projects, in reality students would most likely want to finish and would get more out of a student created, shorter, less demanding project.

Finally, a student-designed project that is required would take the pressure off the fact that it is required because as I said before, student created projects would be less demanding and would allow students to get more learning out of the project. As a high school student I would dislike a high pressure assignment in the summer because we get more than enough of those during the school year. Summer is meant for travel, relaxing at the pool or beach, and being with friends and family, and a high pressure project during the summer is the last thing students need to worry about. Student-designed projects would be lower pressure and would create a sense of fun learning during the summer that students would enjoy.

To finish off, student-designed summer projects would benefit students much more than teacher-designed summer projects because it would make students more willing to complete the required project and the project would be less time-consuming and more enjoyable to complete, since it would be created by students who know what their peers want during the summer. And also, there would be less pressure for the summer project which should be stress-free and hassle-free. Overall, if a school is going to have a required summer project it should be created by a student to ensure the bright minds of students are well-used during the summer.",0
1839,"In the United States, some public schools offer what is called ""distance learning"", a program where students remain at home and have classes online, as an alternative option to attending classes in the school building. There are clear benefits to more schools allowing students to have classes from their homes. Sick students will not find their education hindered, anxious students will not be forced to endure a group setting, and others may find themselves more open to self directed online lessons.

Firstly, it allows sick students to still have their classes, even while bedridden. In schools where students are required to be present in the classroom, sick students miss out on instruction and have to have up the work. Students who are enrolled in a distance learning program can continue to learn, even if they are unable to leave home. Distance learning can also have other benefits in the realm of health.

In terms of mental health, students who suffer from severe social anxiety and have issues being around others would prefer an income learning experience. These students often find themselves unable to cope in the group setting of a school classroom, and unable to learn. The online courses or video conferencing of distance learning would allow these students to participate in school without rising a panic attack.

Another benefit is allowing students a self paced style of learning. The rigid structure and pacing of the classroom could be a ""turnoff"" for some students; distanced learning, at least in online classes if not video conferencing, offers a more relaxed and self directed style. The student determines when they do the work, when they study new content, and for how long they work, with the only strict condition being the deadline when they have to turn it all in. Students enrolled in a self directed online course may find themselves more engaged than if they were in a classroom.

Distance learning is something all schools should implement. It would allow sick students to continue learning, allow anxious students the opportunity to learn while remaining in a safe environment, and provide a more engaging style of learning for others.",0
1840,"Dear principal,

I believe policy 2 is the best way to go because not every student breaks the rules and texts during class, and it just would not be fair to them if they cannot bring their phones period. If you go with policy 2 you can just look ewer your class every so often to make sure no one has their cell phone out. You could also let the class know that they can check their phones during lunch and free time, so there is no need to be checking them during class. You should be able to trust them to follow those rules because they know and should be grateful that they can check them during free times.

Another reason why I think policy 2 is the best idea is because students need the cell phones that their parents provide them with to communicate with them throughout the day. They may also need it after school to call their parents to see how they are getting home, and if they don't have their cell phones there is no way they will know what to do or where to go after school.

Plus, they would need to call their parents if anything dangerous was going on at the school, and it went on lockdown. Parents would be devastated if something bad happened to their child during a time like that, and they didn't know because no one had a cell phone to call them. This is what i believe so I hope this letter has helped you, and you can take it into consideration.

Sincerely,

1841,"Dear TEACHES_NAME,

Some people don't understand why it isn't okay to litter. I think I would be a great idea to litter. I think this because students can learn not to litter and help out are environment too. This is good for everybody it shows we have the initiative to help out making earth a cleaner safer place for everyone. But community serves ID not just for cleaning up the earth It's for also helping people who need us. For example like an elderly home or reading to the blind. There's just so many ways we can help people we just need a little push.

Kids are age don't care if they litter or not but I bet they would if they knew how it affected are environment. Litter can hurt living things because they think it's okay for them to use but it's not some animals try to eat that stuff or build a nest out of it. This could be dangerous for them. Also, most of the trash ends up it streams, lakes, or ponds. Soon there's no water left for the animals or the plants, and they so start to die.

When we help someone out it might make us feel better and more alert of out surroundings. And plus your making someone's day. When we help our other people it shows that we have good leadership skills. When you take time out of your day to help someone or something you're making an effort to help make somebody a little stronger.

Our school should promote community serves to promote that we actually care. And to show that if we can to do it you can do it too.",0
1842,"Why is it important for the teachers to assign summer projects during the long summer break? It is important for the teacher to assign summer projects during long summer break, because it is assures that; the students continues learning during the summer break. Summer break is a long break where students usually forget what they did aid studied last year. So, it is better to for the teachers to assign summer projects, so the students CAI come better prepared aid ready for the classes after a long summer break. Teacher designed projects are usually schooled appropriate, focuses more oi the main idea, aid easy for the teachers to grade the assignment.

Teacher designed projects helps the students to focus oi the main idea. It does IOT distract the students to go off the topic aid focus more oi what teacher waits aid expects from us. It is also helping the students to fulfill the teachers requirement, for example; Ii the future, it would help the college students because they would be more prepared aid ready for it. College professors usually assign really hard projects, so it would be hard aid difficult for the students to do. They also wait us to IOT go off-topic because they DOI't like students giving extra information that is useless. If students have multiple choices to work oi, they usually get confused aid DOI't know what topic is best for them to choose. It gets really hard for the students if they make their own choices, so it is better for the teacher to assign or design a project that has been approved by the teachers department.

Grading projects for the professor/ teachers is AI easy task if the students chose to do the projects that they have assigned. If the students choose to design/ create the project oi their own. It would be kind of hard for the teachers to grade the assignment. They might get confused oi what the actual topic is aid would IOT get a good grade unless you have enough information for the teacher to understand. For example, during the ad of the sophomore year we got a research project to do to get a GPA

Boost. Ii order, to get the GPA boost I needed to do good oi the research assignment. Me aid my parties chose a topic that was IOT a teacher's choice topic aid it was about testing goldfish ii different water levels. The teacher told us that it would be a hard topic to choose as she did this sort of assignment during the college days before becoming a teacher. We both still chose to do it aid took a risk, ii the ad most of the goldfish died during the experiment aid our research assignment Didi't was that well as we thought it would be. Me aid my parties Didi't receive a good grade, we got a B oi the research project. After that I decided to always choose a topic that has been assigned by the teacher because they already been more experienced aid chose what is easy for us to do. This year research assignment is assigned by our teacher aid it is much easier for us to do as it is assigned by the teacher aid until now we have been getting good grades aid just waiting for the final part to complete. It is better to always listed to your teachers point of view because it might help you ii the future aid you might ad with a good grade, Eva you get your teacher's guidance for the project.

Teachers designed projects are usually checked by the academies of Generic_School or the head of the teachers department to assure that it is school prohibited. Projects should be school appropriate because students usually choose topics that might IOT be appropriate for schools. Teachers/ professors knows best what school assignments are appropriate aid what are IOT. If the project is IOT school appropriate, you might get a straight zero ii your grade book aid a combat written, it was IOT a school appropriate project that's why your kid got zero oi your report card. Studeitdesigied project CAI be easy for them unless, it is school appropriate aid meet the certain requirements that has been provided by the teacher. For example, ii the show ''the vampire diaries"", Generic_Name chose to do AI assignment for a history project. It was about the witches aid vampires aid how they were created aid how many are there. This was IOT a school appropriate project for a high school student to research about this kind of topic. So he received zero oi this assignment. Generic_Name teacher talked to him about the project aid gave him a second chance to do a topic that is related to history.

Ii conclusion, teacher designed projects are best for the students because it would help the students to focus more oi what criteria to meet aid what are our teacher's expectations. It would be much easier for the teacher to grade aid help us oi the assignment that she has designed for us. Teacher would assign or create a project that would be useful for us ii the future aid might help us ii many ways. Teacher creates AI assignment that is school appropriate because if it is IOT school appropriate the you'll straight get zero oi the assignment. Teacher chooses the topic are easier aid helpful ii way for their students. Teachers assignments CAI be sometimes really hard aid too difficult at times that you might get confused oi what information to put aid what IOT to. Though, some school requires the teacher's to design a project IOT the student's because it is out of schools law because if they do something wrong, the teacher gets into trouble. Teachers should give summer assignments to the students during summer break because it is very long break aid children usually forget. So the teacher creates these assignments for the students to relearn aid get more knowledge through projects that might help them ii future or their career. However, I think that teachers should be the one designing the projects because it keeps the teacher assure that students are learning important information that might be helpful ii their future.",0
1843,"My opinion is that the electoral college should be abolished.  In source two paragraph eleven Bradford gives an interesting statement to leave the beaded thinking why.  ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor"", mentions the article.  I think what she is trying to say is that the system is prepared fob chaos and that is what might happen in the future if things do not change.

The electoral college system can at many times be irrational.  In source two paragraph thirteen the author puts out a bold and straight forward opinion.  ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to votes"", mentions Bradford.  The author is trying to say that out popular vote created by the people is no longer cabbed fob when electing out president, it is all up to the electoral college.

What do you think about the electoral college?  In source three paragraph fifteen Richard A. Posted gives a very well put together description of what we call the electoral college.  ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" The electors Abe who is actually electing the president, not the people. When you vote fob a presidential candidate you Abe really voting ob a slate of electors instead.

Overall the electoral college is an unfair, outdated, and irrational system.  Do you really think you vote counts?  They Abe lying to you, because it does not. They Abe who decides out president.",0
1844,"Dear, Principal

Us students have a problem with the changes you are making in our school.

We disagree with the not participate in sports or any activities unless we have at least a B average, many students in our school are great at playing sports and with many more activities, but the more students that have a h average many not participate in these activities.

This is not fair to our school we will have a ham pain of student that are great at sports and activities and the one that are very smart to get together and study so we Han keep participating on these activities. We need this thing to keep us going in school for our health, trying something new, helping each other, being friendly with others, and making new friends, if you let this happen we would be on track with our school work and not giving up and trying our best to have and get a B average or even an A average, we will become successful by the time you approve of this letter, we took our time to write it, and we hope you will think about our deal.

We would be glad if you as our principal support us on this ham pain.

Thank You for your time.

1845,"Former British Prime Minister once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I disagree with this statement. In my own experiences I have never failed to succeed, I have always failed to fall. In 711th grade I have tried out for my school basketball team and never made the team. I have also experienced doing something on my first try and succeeding, Failure never brings success.

All throughout my life Y wanted to play basketball for my school. The only problem was every year I tried out Y never made the team. This year I am a senior In high school and still haven't played basketball for my school. I have realized that no matter how good I got YT wasn't enough. Personally Y can not relate with failing to succeed because YT has not happened to me. I have never been able to fall and then succeed.

I can say from my own experiences. Somethings just come to you and your able to keep being good at YT. While there are also things that are not able to do on the first try or ever. For Instance my seventh grade year I was trying out for football. I had never played a game or ever tried out. First try and boom I am on the football team. I played left tackle and was a starter for ""Team"". I had never played before, and I was already starting. Furthermore, I dying fall to succeed, I just succeeded.

As a result from the facts I have stated. I do not believe or agree In ""failing comes success"". Failing happens to everyone and I have yet to hear someone say"" I failed to succeed"". It Is very uncommon for someone. If YT has not happened to me In all of my seventeen soon to be eighteen years of life Y don't believe YT Is possible.",0
1846,"I think that this policy will make kids that want to play sports be forced to get better grades & keep a higher average which will be better for the school & the children that are in the school that play sports. A few supporting details are that this new policy will help the school have more activities because if a school has a good overall average then the government will be more willing to give them resources & it would make parents have more faith in school & the parents will know that they're sending their kids to a good school that will ensure that they get good grades. It would also reflect to the community how good the school is & how they make sure that your kids will get better grades.

But this policy still isn't perfect because it says in the article that the majority of kids in the school have a v average and if they want people that are playing sports to have a B average there should be a way to help kids with a v average get better grades, so they can play sports.

My conclusion is that this policy is a good way to make kids get better grades if they want to play sports, but there should be a way that will help the kids with a v average to get a B average, so they can play sports",0
1847,"A future when no one has to drive sounds almost to Food to be true. Cars that can drive you where you want to Jo and then move on to the next passenger would save time and resources. But can they eliminate the human driver without causing unforeseen problems? Although driverless cars may be helpful far off in the future, the cars do not have the interpretation skills or laws they need to be safe and effective.

As nonrenewable resources diminish and people become busier, the market for new driverless cars will expand pushing the automotive industry to come up with driverless cars. Cars that can pick up passengers and take them where they need to Jo will help use less fossil fuels. After dropping off their passengers, they can pick up new passengers decreasing the time they are traveling without anyone in them like taxis and would, according to Serra Brain, ""use half the fuel of today's taxis"" (1). Also, for busy people they would decrease driving time allowing for the passengers to work or relax during their trip. With all these benefits, people wonder why we do not have driverless cars already.

Even with the positive possibilities of driverless cars, they should not be put into mass use because they lack the interpretation skills needed to drive on the roads which could cause wrecks and lead to miscommunication with others on the road. All the sensors crammed into these cars do a great job collecting information for the car, but the car can not interpret its surrounding the way a human can. If the car ever runs into something it has not been programmed to react to it will either stop causing a major backup or Jo right into the hazard, creating a wreck that other cars may run into. Humans, on the other hand, can react to the things they have never seen before and do what is necessary to avoid a wreck while keeping traffic flowing. In a future with driverless cars, if there are still cars with human drivers, how will they communicate. Even while using the rules of the road, what if someone ways on another person and the driverless car thinks it can Jo. Miscommunication could be deadly, which makes one wonder about what laws would be in place for diverless cars.

The laws for driverless cars are not to the point they would need to be for these cars to run freely on the streets. The courts would be a mess of owners and manufacturers placing fault on each other. As the author points out, if there is an accident, ""who is at fault"" (9). If you jet rear ended by a driverless car, do you collect the money from the manufacturer or the owner of the car? These laws would have to cover both driverless cars hitting driverless cars and regular cars. The time to make all these laws will take quite awhile and then have to be edited as situation arise that had never been considered before. In addition, the laws to create one massive driverless car fleet for everyone to use would take years of planning. Can you use a car to jet to Florida? What if you need to haul animals somewhere or spill a drink in the driverless car? All these answers will have to come before a fleet of driverless cars.

While driverless cars could be beneficial, they have a long way to come in interpretive technology and laws before they can come onto the streets. In the future as driverless cars jet more technology and laws made for them, they may be useful, but right now they are only a thing of the future.",0
1848,"The principal just announced an AEW school rule. The rule says that every student has to participate IA at least OA after school activity. To some people, this is a great idea. To other, it might AOT sound too great. Ia this paper, I will tell you my side oat his AEW rule. Afterwards, I will try to convince you why you should support my claims.

First, I should let you know which side I'm OA. Whether I support the AEW rule or AOT. To be brief, I do support this AEW rule. The principal took a risk with this. The risk he took is the reaction of the parents AAD the teachers. Even with all of that though, IA the long RUA, this rule will pay off.

Ia this paragraph, I will be stating different factors, pros, opinions, AAD more. Everything I state is to convince you to support my side of this AEW rule. First, the extracurricular activities CAA make students happier wheat hey choose AA activity they love. This CAA motivate them to work better AAD harder IA AAD out of school. Secondly, it will push students to be wellrouaded. Third of all, it CAA push kids to do their very best. The coaches, helpers, AAD other adults IA the students' life will push them AAD have them strive to be great.

Going off of my last paragraph, I will continue listing ways that the AEW rule is a good thing. The difference is that I will be talking about mostly the part benefits. First, when kids are at their activities, the parents have more time to relax AAD AOT worry as much. Also, if every single student is at AA activity, Thea more people CAA set up carpools. Ia addition to what I said before, about the student being happier AAD doing better IA school, they CAA have better behavior AAD attitude at home. The kids will be happier all around, which CAA make the part happier. Some parents may be concerned OA how their child will juggle having the activity going OA AAD also maintaining good grades. Eventually, the kid will area to handle it. This teaches them responsibility. This skill CAA be used at school, home, AAD anywhere!

Ia conclusion, that is my paper. I talked about how the principal introduced an AEW school rule that every student has to do AA extracurricular activity. I talked about how I was all for that rule AAD the benefits that came with it. How the coaches AAD other adults CAA encourage the kids AAD help them strive for greatness.

1849,"The ""Facial Action Coding System"" or ""FACS"" is not useful or appropriate in the classroom. Paragraph 6 describes that computers basically watch your face to see what ads to use, and it could be used in the classroom to see what you understand however, it is not likely that a teacher would want for their lesson to be altered because that can create some problems. Having a computer scanning your face 24/7 could also be viewed as kind of wrong and invasive. On the other hand, if people knew they were being watched, they could easily change the appearance of their emotion. People can be very convincing. Lastly, technology is not 100% correct 100% of the time. Things could always glitch and change things for the worse.

Some might view the concept of a computer scanning your face every time you are in front of its camera as minimally invasive. Everyone has different facial expressions that show different things, and it could mean the complete opposite of what the computer views it as. Paragraph 7 describes that a computer can scan your face to see if there is an ad that you don't like and show less ads like that one. Rot only does that have nothing to do with using it in a classroom, but no one likes ads in the first place, and you have to pay to get them removed. Also, some teachers like to try and read their student to get a feel of how their day is or see if they're ""living their best life"". While this is sometimes very sweet, sometimes people like to be left alone when they're in a mood. This technology could literally increase the percentage of teachers being in people's business. They already have that Dy know app that screen records all of our screen, so they can see what we're doing at all times, why would they need to know how we're feeling as well?

As an actress and show choir student I can safely say that we, in the performing arts community, can definitely put on a facade. Others may not be in either of those activities however, people can still be very convincing. Personally, if I knew I was being watched I'd probably fake some of my emotions. People on shows like ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Law and Order"" are paid to put on a fake face. Their job is to literally be fake for a camera. There are episodes of those shows where people are crying, and they look very pained. Chances are, they are not really feeling those emotions. Arizona Robins may have cheated on Callie Torres but Jessica Ca pshaw didn't cheat on Sara Ramirez. That's fake emotion. They might not be it their character is, so they have to play that part and be convincing, or they don't get the part. In show choir there are songs where we have to be angry and then suddenly happy and then concerned all in a matter of sixteen counts and if we can to that then we can change how we portray our emotions when we are being watched by a camera.

There are so many applications and pieces of software they are in the world now and no matter how advanced the technology may be, it is never always perfectly running. Even the latest technology glitches from time to time. Technology is constantly updating and changing due to bugs in the software. Technology like this could ruin something completely. Everyone has a focus face that they put on when they're reading something or solving an equation. Let's say someone's focus face looks a little angry. Just because their face looks angry does not mean that they don't like the question or don't like how it's taught or explained, it just means that they're focused on what they're doing. If the software misreads a facial expression and changes what's on the screen it could completely mess up what the student is doing. Or if the student does need the way of teaching adjusted, and it does change. It could cause problems with the teacher because some teachers want things done a very specific way. If something happen with the software and it could inconvenience the student in many ways.

In conclusion, Facial Action Coding System should not be put in classrooms. IT's not completely useless, but if it's not very useful either. People don't need their face read to see how they feel about an ad or about a teaching style, that's why surveys were invented. If someone wanted people to know who they felt every time they turned on a computer, they'd start a blog. There are awful actors on this planet, but there are a lot of liars and pretenders. If a lot of people knew they were being recorded and faked a smile because they think that their privacy is at stake, it would completely defeat the purpose of the system, and it would all be for not. Technology is also very expensive these days and this type of thing can easily be hacked, or it could glitch and once again, defeat the purpose of the system. ",0
1850,"I think sqq king multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. When getting multiple opinions it can help you make a better decision because you can sqq all sides of the situation. Another reason it is important is that you can have the positives and the negatives of what could happen. The last reason is that you could change your view or opinion on the situation.

When making a big or little decision it is always good to have multiple points of views. Instead of just having on or two, you could have five or six and have more thought go into your decision. On good thing about this is that you could have people that don't think or act the same as you look at the situation and give you advice on what to do. If you get multiple opinions you will probably talk to a few people who have had to make a tough decision before. They could help you figure it out or tell you what they did when they QRQ in the same situation. What I think is the most important reason is, is that you ARQ able to explore people that don't think the sames as you opinions and your decision will most likely become easier to make once you have hard other peoples advice.

When getting different peoples advice it could sometimes change how you look and think about your decision. On good thing that comes out of multiple peoples advice is that you could realize the decision you ARQ about to make might not by as good as you thought it was. You could also change how you look at the decision and realize that there could by better options where you would by happier. The last reason is that you might by on the verge of making that decision just because you think it would by better for you even though it is not. If you talk to a couple of people about it they could change your mind, and you would by grateful you didn't follow through after all.

The last reason that it is a good idea to get multiple opinions to make a better choice is that you can get the pros and cons of a situation. On good reason to get the positives and negatives is because you will by able to compare if the good things about this decision out weigh the bad things. Another thing is that you decide if the risk is worth the reward. The final reason is that by comparing the goods and bad you might realize that you could by affected in a bad way more than you could by affected in a good way.

In conclusion, when asking for advice more opinions is always better than less when getting advice. Getting multiple opinions is good because you have more ways to think about the situation, you can look at the pros and cons and what could go wrong, and the last reason is you could change your view of the situation if other people tell you or convince you it's not a good idea. ",0
1851,"Ching Ching! This is the sound you might hear more and more as our world starts to rely less on outomobles. There are some advantages to this, there will be less air polution, less fossil fuels being burned, and less accidents. As with everything, there are always two sides of the arguement too.

First, there will be less polution because there will be less, or no automobles creating it. cars contribute 12 percent of the Earth's greenhouse gasses. Other countries have begun setting days that people can't drive becasue the polution gas gotten so substantial.

Another reason it would be helpful to use automobles less is because the majority of them burn fossil fuels to make them run, and this is devistating our worlds fuel supply. Fossil fuels are non-renewable, and if we burn up all of it that we have, we will never have it agin.

Last, there will be less accident, which will result to less people getting injured or worse. There are so many automobile accident every year, if we cut them out of out society, the accident rate would be decreassed substansally.

In conclusion, there are many different reasons why getting rid of cars would be a positive movement for our society. It would reduce pollution, accidents, and the burrning of fossil fuels.",0
1852,"Throughout the years, in fact between the years 20022014, numerous newspapers and reporters have reported that having the lack of cars can actually benefit the earth and its population. Also, they say, there are advantages to them. But what exactly are these advantages that could prosper so many car loving fans? Well, there are actually 2 advantages of people would love to have:1, People are much happier and 2, the stress that afflicts many today are gone and also parks are blooming throughout one city because of the lack of the automobiles. So let's consider these wonderful advantages of not having any car.

First, People are much happier without cars than they are with cars.  According to the New York Times, one mother who is a media trainer and the mother of two reports as to saying: ""I'm much happier this way."" Her Name is Hadron Walter, and she lives in an area of Germany called Vauban. Vauban is a city where 'street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden.' If to enjoy this kind of happiness in a world full of grim people, who wouldn't want to take up not driving a car?

Second, The stress that people have today are gone and at one city parks are blooming. According to the news reporter Andrew Silky, from The Seattle Times, he writes these words spoken by one businessman in Bogotá, Colombia: ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress."" Mr. Silky also writes this about the parks blooming throughout the city of Bogotá:""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city."" The Advantages of not driving a car are pretty great.

In conclusion, the advantages of not having a car to drive are very numerous. Another reason for not having to drive a car is that of pollution. And the list could go on. So as has been shown, People are happier and stress free without having to drive cars. So may you ever be happier if you don't have to drive cars.  ",0
1853,"The residents of Vauban, Germany have given up their cars to live in a car free environment. Some residents believe that this environment makes them happier. The reason behind this is that we are trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that come from tailpipes. This experiment has the potential to become the most advanced experiment in low car suburban life.

There are many places in the world that are trying this new experiment out. In the United Stateside Environmental Protection Agency is promoting communities to become less dependent on cars. The legislators are starting to act on the bill and experts even expect public transportation to play a larger role in society.

Also, in Paris, France there were days of near record pollution. This is another reason for the experiments, to slow down the amount of pollution. Paris enforced a driving ban to slow down the pollution. The ban worked out so good that they even followed up on it afterwards.",0
1854,"This debate about self operating cars has been in the new for years now. Google say it that they have made one of the first ones. But as our technology has progressed farther, so has our ideas about things. There are many pros and cons on this situation but here are just a few pros and cons, the car keeps you alert, its can cause accidents, and it may cause lots of money.

I will start off with the pro of keeping you on task and alert. This is a major pro in this world. Why do I say that? Well, the car has sensors that make you put your hands on the wheel, so it knows you are focused. In other words you will not be able to tent and drive at the same time. This is the answer to this tragedy.

On we go with this debate but now on the cons of a self operating car. There a just as many cons than there are pros. A major con is the accidents. There hasn't been any accident according to the passage, but there will be some in the near future. If this happens, who is the blame going to be put on. On the manufacturer? Or what if the person gets injured? The real question that it brings up is,""Who to Blame?""

I shall now talk about another con in this piece of machinery. This self driving car can be very helpful in many ways but the next problem we face is the money. Money is always a problem when it comes to technology. This car will have to be covered in sensor which allow the car to react, but it will be very expensive. It also says in the story that the roads will have to be rebuilt because of it.

At the end of the day this self driving car can be both a good thing and a bad thing. But it can keep your eyes on the road, it can cause accidents, and it will cost a lot of money.",0
1855,"The advances of limiting car usage is Jot only helping the community but also yourself. IJ Vauban, Germany 70 percent of their families do Jot own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to live here. People find it better to walk to places rather that having to use a vehicle. ""All of our development since World War II has been centered OJ the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, AJ official of Transportation America. The Environmental Protector Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. Delivery companies complained of lost reveals, while exceptions were made for plugin cars.

1856,"The Electoral College is best described as outdated and obsolete. It was designed so that, when there were too many states and poor technology, the vote could be fairly and reallistically counted, by voting between a few people from each state. This was good and efficient for that time, but, with the technology available to us today, it is impractical and easy to corrupt. if you live in a mostly Democratic state as a Republican, your vote is regarded as nothing, and you would have no reason to vote in the electoral college, instead of throwing your vote into the entire mass of the united states, where it has a chance to even slightly influence the vote. Also, since larger states are given more attention, due to the all-or-nothing attitude of most states, other states are given less information and are forced to make more wild guesses than votes, a result of having less information.

When the idea of the Electoral College was introduced, the telegraph was still pretty hot technology. All votes would be counted by hand by an impartial court, counting off the vote of every single person individually, out of perhaps more than a million voters. Instead of this, each state would record their own numbers and dispatch a group of electors, who could not be influenced away from their vote, while sending a horseman or a few across the hundreds of miles of U.S. territory with a few little scraps of paper with votes on it would be impractical and dangerous. bags could be lost, a rider could have an accident, entire counties would be unaccouted for. The Electoral College was a nessecity as well as a stroke of genius, and I applaud the man who thought of it. However, this was when the telegraph was a stroke of genius, too. Now we have a cell phone the size of a notecard that can store thousands or millions of votes alone. We have processors that can count the number of people that like apples versus oranges and come out with a percentage, verdict, reciept, and the best bussines option as soon as the numbers are input, as soon as we push that little blue ""Enter"" button. We can send the votes through the air in the billions, without as much as wires to conduct them. there is little or no possibility of tampering or miscommunication, and there are records to back up and correct every single little error. it is much smarter, safer, and more accurate to initiate a simple counting program on the computer, with each individual terminal sending all of it's results and information to a higher terminal until all of the information is scored, backed up, double checked, counted, percentaged, and a final verdict is reached. This can even be done in a way to run the information separately to different computers, to minimize tampering. The electoral college is obsolete, a small parasite of politicians who just dont want this to end. we dont still use the telegraph, do we?

The electoral college is not only obsolete, unnesessary and parasitic, but also unfair to many voters. The main ways this unfairness can be identified are extreme, and each really deserve a paragraph of their own. Let us imagine a scenario: a democrat lives in a mostly republican state. He goes to vote. His vote is passed along, checked off, and placed aside for a time. When all of the votes are in, the republican votes outweigh the democrats. Now, our democrat's vote, his wife's vote, the democratic guy who works at 7-11 down the street's vote, Joe's vote, Bob's vote, Billy's vote, ""That girl Suzie's"" vote and ALL THE DEMOCRATIC VOTES IN THE STATE are all, essentially, thrown into the furnace, and will do so next election, the election after, and essentially every mostly republican election after that. In a popular vote without the barrier of the Electoral College, all those votes would flow into the pile for whichever canidate they voted for. Then the pile would be counted, divided into the total votes, and percentaged. then, at lest the votes could count for SOMETHING, other than a waste of time. But wait! there's more. Most states have an all-or-nothing ideal, meaning if politician A got 51% of the votes in California, while politician B still got 49%, Politician A gets 55 votes in the Electoral College, while politician B gets squat. This does not represent the best interests of many of the people in that state. this is unfair. It also means that larger states have the advantage, because they get more votes, like California (55), Texas (38), and Florida (29), while smaller states get less, such as Alaska (3), Rhode Island (3), and Hawaii (4). Just to add insult to injury, this means that larger states are more fought over by politicians, leaving smaller states practically ignored. This is unfair to people in the Dakotas or Montana have no information to base their votes on, instead just picking a canidate by mainly party affiliation. the biggest political battles are in fact fought over the biggest states, in the forms of advertisements and propaganda. Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called ""swing states,"" where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state's votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway. With an uncensored popular vote, the political canidates will be forced to advertise for all of the united states, instead of just the bigger or indevisive states. this will also remove all of the unfair advantages from the larger states, including more information as well as an unfairly weighted voting system.

In conclusion, the electoral college was the most efficient and sucessful way to vote, back in the 1700-1800. However, with current communication and transportation technologies, the College has become obsolete, to the point where it should be buried at a crossroads with a stake through it's heart. It is unfair, biased, impractical, and just overall worthless. We should put our newfound technology and knowledge to use and do away with the electoral College, once and for all.",0
1857,"Over winter break when school was out my science teacher assigned work to do online. All the students were required to do it by the beginning of the next class. Even though I had a full week to do it, I still waited until the day before to finish the assignment. I got distracted by my phone and plans with friends. When students enter a classroom setting they become more focused and distractions decrease. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, reminding us that distractions are limited in a controlled environment.

Students would not benefit from at home classes because there are limited rules. At home students would not have a teacher helping them or reminding them to stay on task. Students would benefit from having an adult figure telling them assignments and when they are due. In an at home classroom setting there are no rules or teachers telling students to get off their phones. There is nothing stopping the student from changing to a different tab or playing games instead of doing the work. Students are already on their phones at school too much, so when the rules decrease at an at home setting the students would do whatever they want. If students were to be kept in a controlled environment like a classroom then they would keep the rules in mind and not break them. There would also be someone enforcing the rules onto the students unlike at home.

Students would not benefit from at home classes because it allows for more procrastination. In a classroom students have a due date for assignments. They also have a teacher enforcing the due dates and reminding them to do it. In an at home classroom setting, the due dates stay but the teacher enforcement does not stay. Students are more likely to wait to do their work when they do not have someone pushing them to do it, than if someone was telling them to do it. A teacher creates a controlled environment but in an at home classroom the control goes away. The procrastination would increase and the amount of work being done would decrease significantly. The students would easily procrastinate the work that needs to be done and cause more stress on themselves.

Students would not benefit from at home classes because there is a lack of motivation. Students would not be motivated in an at home learning setting because they have other things they could be doing. When students are in a school they are not allowed to just leave and do whatever they want, but at home they can simply close the computer screen and go about their day. This temptation would over come most students and they would not succeed. Some people believe that at home classes would be beneficial to students, but they are wrong because the amount of distractions at home are far more significant than the relaxing environment some people think that the at home school would create.

Distractions at home cause at home schooling to be not beneficial to students. Parents, students, and schools should do more research on the negative effects of at home schooling before enrolling. The at home schooling bandwagon has many negative effects that outweigh the positive. Students would not benefit from online classes and their learning would suffer due to the amount of distractions and problems that come with online schooling. ",0
1858,"Dear Principal,

I think that it is unfair that kids cant have sports or activities the one reason i say this is because sports and activities is not stopping kids to learn. I think if you take away sports it will hurt children because if the kid would like to be a football, basketball, soccer player he/she couldn't achieve that goal because the school is taking away sports and activities. I think that you should have these sports but kids with a d-f should not be able to participate in the sport or activity, so if a child is really interested he/she will step up and do what he/she can do to improve his/her grade. When your a student you just want to express yourself and have time off to join sports and games. Kids enjoy this and if you take this opportunity away from them they will be very upset. Sports and activities can also help you get into the college you would like to go to because when a child is joining a sport lots of college professors want to see that. Another thing i would like to point out is that lots of kids would like to have a prep rally and see there friends and family play that sport. Sense i am a student here i would dislike not having to play sports or do activities. When kids play a sport it takes there stress away and hypes them up so taking a sport opens there minds. Children this age just want fun and games so i do think this might be to much credit for them but it still wont be fair for the students not being able to become what they want to be when there older, Also being a student your in school for about eight hours and after school people would enjoy doing what they love and go to there sports and or activities. I would like to say thank you for your time and effort i hope you understand.",0
1859,"I think that by extending the school hours is not a very good idea. Because there might be some students that have things to do after school and teacher as well. It will effect everyone at the school because there are some students that don't like school very much. So by extend the hours they will not show up to school and that will affect the school and them.

I don't think it will be a very good because there might have some student that have work after school. Or they might have to go and pick up there little brother or sister. And by extending the hours it will not let them do it because they have to be in school and some student will lose there job because they had to stay at school all day.

Some student might have to walk to school and if you extend the school hours then it will get dark, and then they can't walk home alone. It will get dangers to go home alone so its best if the hours stay the same because then they will all be fine and by keeping it all the same can help a lot of people.

By extending the school hours the student might not be mad to stay all day at school, so some student will not show up at school. Because they will not want to show up at school because they don't want to and that will affect everyone that u know. Because the student will fail and that won't help them at all.

If you extend the school hour then there is going to be more homework to do and held at the end. Because there is go to be more work to do at the end.

Some teachers are going to have something to do and work at thing at their homes so by extending the hours the teacher that have thought to do they will not be above to do it and that will make them mad, and then they will quit sand that would not be a good idea for the school and the teacher and the student.

So that is why we shouldn't do it because it will affect a lot of people, and then it will make all lot of people not very happy so if we just keep it the way its soapstone it will be all OK cause then the student will be happy and the teachers will be happy so keeping it the way we have it will help a lot of people.",0

1861,"I find that driverless cars is not only a Sad idea But a Sad advocate, I also find that this car is a Sad advocate for not only teenagers But adults as well. Although the car does seem cool Because it is something new doesn't mean it won't malfunction while Sang used at anytime. People would have to take extra procession while using this type of car. I could see more accidents in the future rather than safe driving.

The main reason I find that driverless cars is a Sad idea is Because of drunk driving. Teens and adults already take full advantage of it, so why wouldn't this car advocate more drunk driving? Not only on top of cars malfunctioning, you have to pay extra procession, and plus on top of all that someone decides to drink and drive. People don't understand all the responsibilities you have to take on while having a driverless car.

As to many teens they like to show off, a lot. That is something everyone likes to do, But imagine all the horrific things that driverless cars could cause. It only takes one person to get distracted SY their cellphone or other passengers in the car. Something could happen to the car in just a short period of time, The car could malfunction But the driver responsible wouldn't know, or they didn't have enough time to stop the car or give their attention to the road.

In my opinion I Believe that driverless cars should See Banned from every state. Driving isn't just about getting to your destination, But keeping drivers, passenger, and pedestrians safe. Only alert drivers would See in the proper state to drive one of these cars But teens and other drivers that aren't very alert and are already not safe drivers and could cause many problems.",0
1862,"Would you want to do a summer project that is either teacher designed or student designed? I chose a student designed project. It gives students the choice of what type of project they actually want to do. The project they'll choose can relate to an activity they may be doing over the summer break. Also, they can show their creativity and knowledge on the topic or subject.

First, by choosing the type of project you want to do, it would make you interested in doing the project. When teachers assign projects not everybody is interested in doing them. By being uninterested, they wouldn't give it their best effort. Also, being able to choose the way you do the project or the topics you select, will make it a fun and enjoyable project. Every student is different and would want to do their work differently from others. Having many topics to choose from gives a variety of projects to do.

Secondly, they can choose a project that relates to an activity they may be doing over the summer break. Having fun during summer break is what all students look forward to. They might not want to think about school work or even do it. By doing a project related to what they're doing during the summer, can make them willing to give it a try. In this way students can still enjoy their summer breaks and complete the project as well.

Oastly, students can show their creativity and knowledge in the project they give. Oetting them pick their topic of the project can show the teacher their knowledge on what they've chosen. By making posters, slide shows, poems, models, and even booklets can express how creative you are. Showing how much you know about the topic in your project you can make a good grade and feel successful by completing it. Even though projects can seem a little boring, creating your own the way you like it is much better.

In conclusion, having the students assign their own projects is more convenient than the teachers assigning the project. When teachers give assigned projects not all students want to do that topic. Students will have the freedom to choose their own project to do in their own way. They can make the project on anything they're interested in. In these ways students can still enjoy their summer break. While all having fun and enjoying the sun, the project is sure to be done.",0
1863,"Dear principal,

I think that cell phones should be aloud at school because there are various reasons why students would need a none. What if a student's parents needed to call them and they didn't have the school's none number? What if a student accidentally missed the bus, and they need to call their parents? What if there was an accident at the school and the student needed to call someone? There are a wide variety of reasons for a student to have cell none at school which I will go into more detail about.

What if a student's parent needed to call him/her to tell them that they're not going to be at the house and the key are under the mat. What if the parent wanted to tell the student that they're going to nick the student UN after school and the student's already let the school on the bus? What if one of the student's parents died and needed to contact them? These are logical reasons.

What if the student wanted to contact the parent and tell them that there was no school and to come to nick the mun? What if the student needed a medication and needed to contact the parent? What if the student needed held with getting a project home and needed to contact the parent? These reasons are valid.

What if the student's school was on fire and needed to contact you? What if the school was at a threat? What if the school was under lockdown and the student needed to call the parent? These are reasonable reasons.

I hone principal that you would reconsider banning cell phones after reading these reasons.

1864,"Dear. Mr. senior

The electoral college is it right that you have speaker that decide for you? When we pick a president when have to think about the outcome ad what will change and what is he planing on doing it we elect him. Everyone in office basic decides what were going to do nobody has a sad in it. The tell us where we go in war the ca start something the might think the can finish but everyone will be against them or the decide who going to war or not and if we come home to see our family.

So think about when we go to elect someone think about dour father and how it white be if the sit in the big chair. Also when you go to vote do who decides if we want them to speak for our state taxes has 34 electors to speak for you and tot ell you about how things are going to run. But who you white ask? Because that who you voted for without even realizing it when you chose president you chose sing you life basically

When wet run 18 we all as American citizens have the right to vote but who are you voting for we leave in a nondemocratic country where everything is not ran BD one person but several and is that right to have other people speak for how dour life wants to be. Most of you sad no but that the world we live in today and all of this is based on a populated vote.

A dispute about the outcome a Electoral collage is possible but hard hard to because you mad have other people wanting it but mad not see it dour wad. Herd elected vote needs a presidential vote to so if we do the math you have a state and a country against you so the odds aren't in dour favor. Now there is a method called winner takes all and it basically what the sad gone!

Do you think you should have people deciding you faith? People like the president or the electoral collage. So you mad not know where dour life is headed but is it ok to have them chose dour life off of some vote you had no clue you picked him. Well then do agree with the electoral college.

1866,"I think that summer is to enjoy the weather, family, friends and if you have a pet also him and everything else.

nobody would like to be thinking about school work or trying to figure it out to complete homework.

In my opinion students need to relax from a big long year of school and this is not just convenient for young people, we also know that we have a clear example of Adult people(older people)

They also need a big break from their jobs because they might feel exhausted or stressed with work same as students and so that I am not trying to compare adults with young people I know they have even more responsibilities with their lives, but students comes to be more understandable because of the reason that they need to save more energy and have enough sleeping time, but adults also need the same things and due to that many jobs required just a week of vacation (sometimes even more) they feel really streets and tired and that why they would really wish to have a big vacation to can spend time with their family etc. same with student now that they have the opportunity to have a big vacation enjoy it.

Plus many students really love summer because the weather(the warm breeze) the feeling of summer or the feeling that you know like freedom not worry about your grades, activities, projects etc. makes a lot of difference between a long break and a shorter brake, but I also take the position of the educator, I know they wouldn't like to been repeating things to make student remember of the subjects they saw the last year and having issues with things they forgot, That would be really stressful but come on! Who wouldn't like a big vacation? Good for some teachers that save money to enjoy summer.

I also take the student position and as student I identified my self with the first character I describe when Students need the vacation to relax, but there's another big example of why vacation should be longer. first some students plan their goals during the summer probably to get a full time job during summer (I KNOW EVEN SOME TEACHERS do)

To can save money and spend it on things they need another example is to save money for college, yes for college.

And probably this is the major goal of many students trying to have a great summer because of the only reason that they don't have as much support as the other students but at the same time I understand teacher or educators because their goal is to push us up in our goals and the once a year a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week of in spring and fall sounds really nice since some student may love the weather by those times even though they like to see the fall so there's not problem concluding with everything else it will be almost the same as the regular summer vacation except that It will be shorter.

In conclusion, the break that we already have is perfect because of the only reason of that many student loves it, the weather is so chill the beaches are already open and is enough time to go out of town to see your family and have a great time with them and good for those who liked to work during summer just to have some extra money or help a little of bet their Spencer.",0
1867,"What is the Seagoing Cowboys program?

It was to help many countries that had been scarred by World War II.

These people helped with cattle and other animals that were shipped to Europe to help them.

People were asked to help by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, or UNRWA.

People should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because, you get to help other countries and people, you get to see many parts of the world, and you have fun.

If you are in the Seagoing Cowboys program, you can help other countries by giving them animals for food and work.

It makes you feel good about yourself.

The article says,"" It made me more aware other countries and their needs.""

That would make someone feel good about themselves for helping other countries.

Wouldn't that make you feel good?

In the Seagoing Cowboys program, you can see many parts of the world depending on where you are going.

You could see Italy and other countries.

The article states, ""Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China.""

That would be very exciting.

How would you like to see a bunch of different countries while working?

You wouldn't have to pay for travel

While working for this program, you would also have fun.

The people aboard the ship would play games on the way back to get more animals.

The cowboys would also play baseball and other games in empty ship holds where the animals were on the way there. Also, the article even states that they played games.

Even though you are working, you will still have fun.

So, if you are in the Seagoing Cowboys program, you will have fun, you will feel good about yourself, and you will also get to tour and visit many parts of the world.

Many people helped with the Seagoing Cowboys program.

They helped many countries in Europe.

The cowboys still got to do what they always did, help with animals.

So, do you think that you would want to become a Seagoing Cowboy?

Cr at least be in the program.  ",0

1869,"Dear Principal,

To begin with, I think this world is were to be on and do anything we want too.

But I think that our community is important to us because it's a place to have fun with friends and family.

But its full of different kinds of both good and bad stuffs.

I think every student in schools should Perform in community service.

Not only student parents can also volunteer if they want too.

We can find a way for students to participate to perform community service, like do a party or have fun after participating

But some might say it takes up their planning time but I think if everyone participates it wouldn't be so hard. We could also find a way for them like do it twice a day or schedule a time so they can do they can do what they need to do.

I think if we take care of Tue community other place might do it too.

This could change Tue community and Tue whole wide world.

I hope everyone perform community service.

Sincerely, your student at SCHOOL_NAME",0
1870,"Cars are quite helpful to an extent.  According to Source 1, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" the usage of cars is beginning to decrease. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe"" says Elisabeth Rosenthal. Most of the bills that are being paid show that 80 percent of the Government's money is going towards the production of highways, while only 20 percent is going to other transport.

Although not having cars around may eventually lead to an increase of time that it takes to get to different destinations, it also has many advantages. The smog around Paris has been said to be created by the amount of cars around the area. Paris put a partial ban on driving in order to reduce the amount of smog.  On specific days, even-numbered license plates would not be allowed to travel, the owners of these vehicles were ordered to leave their cars at home that day. If this order was not followed, the owners would be forced to pay a $31 fine. Drivers with odd-numbered license plates had to follow this same procedure the next day. The people of Paris had to alternate the days they could drive their cars.  As said in Source 2, ""Almost 4,000 drivers were fined.""

Not allowing many cars on the roads causes there to be a significant decrease in the amount of traffic.  In Paris, after they placed a partial ban on driving, ""Congestion was down 60 percent. . ."" Bogotá then participated in what they call a ""Car-free Day."" This led to no traffic jams, and only buses and taxis on the roads. The people in Bogotá walked, skated, took a bike or a bus to work that day. Once again, violators had to pay a $25 fine. Andrew Silky states that, ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" This day became a big hit in Bogotá, so Cali and Valledupar, two other Columbian cities, joined them in this successful event.

The United States is viewed as ""[O]né of the world's prime car cultures."" The US had the most amount of cars traveling on the roads per day. Slowly, the amount of cars is decreasing due to a rise in tunnel tolls. Also, According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, due to ""demographic shifts in the driving population. . . There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16-to 39- year-olds getting a license. . . .""  Between the years of 2001 and 2009, ""23 percent of young people driving decreased.""  ",0
1871,"Cell phones have become very popular over the past years. Teens and adults are on their phones all times of the day for hours doing nothing.

They shouldn't use they phone because it causes accident and most of the time when u on the phone driving people can't multitask, and they get distracted and pay more attention to the phone instead of the road and end up hitting a car from and the person that be on the phone they be the ones with no insurance.

Report has that 1.6 million car crashes are caused because drivers try to text and drive. If the police had a device to see if a person is on their phone while driving, they should lose their driver.

But all together nobody should ever get away with texting and driving because if somebody was texting and driving and hit you from the back you will be mad.  ",0
1872,"I agree with the idea of a year-round school because It sounds great to me. This idea has a lot of benefits towards the students and also the educators too. This idea provides a beneficial environment for both the students and the educators.

One of the reasons that this is a great idea is that,It makes the students to retain information easily when they get back from their break. They would retain information easily because the break they were given wasn't a long break and that will help them remember the materials that they were taught before the break. The other reason is that,the students will gain more knowledge by learning more materials. They will learn a lot of which will be beneficial to them,not only inside the school but also outside the school. They will also stay on task and be more focused on their studies.

Another reason is that,this idea of a year-round school will make work easy for the educators. It will make their work easy by not making them repeat the materials that the previously have taught because the students are able to remember the materials easily. They won't be forced to create retake tests and assignments and that would allow them to have an easy job. An example of why a year-round school is beneficial is that,It creates an environment where the students enjoy learning and the educators enjoy teaching.

Lastly,I would say that a year-round school is a great idea because It creates an environment where both the students and the educators can benefit from. It Impacts both the students and the educators in a productive way. The students would have more passion and love towards learning while the educators would also gain more passion towards their profession and remarkably enjoy teaching.",0
1873,"Since the beginning of time people have always wanted the next big thing. After watching many movies where cars that don't need drivers are being used, people have wanted to make this a reality. Since 2009 there have been cars that could drive independently under certain conditions (paragraph 2). However, by making these driverless cars legal it makes driving even more dangerous.

In paragraph 7 it states, "" this means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" After drivers get use to this car they will be more relaxed and not as alert as usual. It will be easy for drivers to drift off or get distracted. Xhis is because the car is doing most of the work. Xhis could cause many wrecks that could injure not only the driver, but others on the road too.

When driving a driverless car many drivers would not be aware of their surroundings. In paragraph 8 it says, "" Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way the Inca system is actually a safety feature."" If drivers are texting while using a Driverless car, then it means they are not paying attention. In an emergency the driver would not have enough time to stop. If a child or animal ran out in front of the car, it would be too late. Xhe driver would not have enough time to react and stop the car. Xhe car would not have enough time to alert the driver.

Another con about a driverless car is who to blame when an accident occurs. Paragraph 9 states, "" If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer?"" Many car accidents take place each day, which means the odds of a driverless car getting in an accident are probably pretty likely. If this did occur the driver could blame the manufacture saying that the car didn't alert the driver. Xhe manufactures could blame the driver by saying that any driver of a driverless car must always be alert. Xhis now affects not only the driver, but the manufactures and the other people in the accident.

Driverless cars would make roads even more dangerous and unsafe. Xhey give drivers an excuse to not pay attention to the road and the surrounding things. Xhis could cause very serious accidents. It is safest if cars remain where drivers are always in control. ",0
1874,"Americans in the world are using cell phones in every hour of their lives. Cell phones allow connection with the world. However, it is now considered more fashionable to carry a phone and less about what benefits cellphones actually offer. Cell phones offer multiple characteristics (in addition to communication) including cameras, TV games, texting, music, social media etc. As a result, because cell phones offer so much more other things to do besides communication, cell phones should not be used while driving.

Cell phones are a big distraction while driving. Drivers can easily lose focus on the road and switch lanes without noticing what they are doing because their eyes are not on the road. Therefore, it is not safe for to use cell phones while driving because kids will grow into teens and think it is cool to use their phones while driving because their parents did it. There have been more accidents with teens than ever before. Phones take your attention from the road and you can endanger citizens. The greatest disadvantage of using cell phones while driving is that it distracts away from the road.

In my state of Georgia, there is a new law called the hands-free-law. The hands free law says texting while driving is banned. Also, drivers cannot use hand held devices when driving. Therefore, drivers should not be able to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. Since this law bans the hand-held usage of electronics devices while running a vehicle, drivers should use hands-free devices. Some hands-free device options include: blue-tooth devices and or GPS devices.

In closure, I believe that drivers should not use cell phones while driving. Using a hand-held device and driving isn't safe for the driver, other drivers, or even nearby civilians. Using a hand-held device takes more effort while driving than having a hands-free device. When driving, you should not have to multi- task. While driving you need to concentrate on the road. However, you cannot focus on the road if you're trying to use your phone at the same time.",0
1875,"My school should not follow the model by extending the school day two hours. A four day school week would be wonderful but, however, student would not like the fact that they have to stay in school for two extra hours. If my school extend the day for two hours; more students would skip class and not come to school. Some parents would be mad because they would spend less time at home with they children because of that. Generic_School should really cut school week to four days. I Think that its really unnecessary to extend the school day to two hours.

If My school decide to extent the school day by two hours, class would be longer and student's would get less sleep and come to school tired everyday. They can only extend the school day if we only go to school tree days a week. A four days a week school is still too much for kids to be going to. A bunch students barely wants to go to school for a whole week. Some student wouldn't have enough time to stay back in school for two extra hours ,because they work right after they get out of school.

Parents would be really mad if they had to wait two extra hours for they kids to get out of school. Most parent would rather they kids to stay in school for the whole week so they can get out on time. A four-day school school week would be good but staying in school for two extra hours is not worth it. Students would be in school for almost half a day if they stay back for the two hours. I rather be on my regular school schedule.

If Generic_School extend the school hours, kids would have more time to run the halls and skip they classes. By adding extra hours to our regular time , kids will have more time to get in trouble or get suspended. School shouldnt be no more than 7hours long. Every students should go to school on time so they can get out on time.

Extending the school hours is really unnecessary. Kids shouldnt stay in school for extra hours if they got to go to school for a whole week. School should just let out on regular time so the students could go home and get some rest. We should never have to stay in school for extra hours unless if its snowing outside. So its best that we stay on our regular school schedule and not add extra hours.           ",0
1876,"Some students need alternatives for learning and schools should be liable to provide them. Whether it's a class or just school in general, students should have options based on whichever Kay they learn the best. Some students just Kant to take online, so they can use their resources while doing their work, others like it because it's the environment they are able to learn in the most efficiently in. In my opinion, it doesn't matter that reason they have to take the class. All that matters is the student is getting a better grade and learning more than the environment he or she keys in. Of course, they're people who need to be in a different environment because of medical or mental reasons; But this doesn't mean KE shouldn't provide it for those who are struggling in a classroom environment.

Honestly I find this prompt ironic because this year is the first time I've taken an online class and I've been asked, ""isn't that for kids kith special needs?"" , and I find myself saying exactly that I wrote in the first paragraph! Since I am taking an online class I can safely say that it has helped me. The reason I took my class online (History) is because the classroom I keys in keys very hectic. I am in honors and that is one of the few honors classes I am taking, so I didn't Kant the reason for me dropping out of honors to be my teacher/class, and that's then I thought about online class. Instead of dropping the class I keys able to still take honors online and my grade Kent from a C to an A. On top of that, I have more fun being in this class, so it makes me Anna learn. I truly believe that I can learn more in a keep of online class than I would a year of History kith Generic_Name. It's not that he's a bad teacher, once again, it's just that environment isn't for me.

I believe that schools should feel obligated to provide an alternative for student's education. In my opinion, the evidence speaks for itself. Would you rather spend a year lasting your time in a class that you might fail because it isn't the Kay you learn, or would you rather spend 8 months in a class that you'll have fun in and retain the information for the rest of your life? Duh, the one you'll do bad in.(sarcasm) Schools already provide alternatives for a lot of kids, but mostly for people who need it (medical reasons). But that doesn't mean the students who are struggling in ordinary environments don't ""need"" it too.

1878,"If your principal decided you had to participate in one after school activity would you agree to it? I would not agree to that because there are many reasons why kids can't do that, or they may just not want to. Some reasons for this is they may have little siblings to watch after school, they may have social anxiety, or they may have a job to held support their family.

Many children that go to school have to go home after school to watch their little sibling. As a result of this they may not be able to participate in any after school activities. Many children have to go home and watch their sibling while their parents are not there because they may not have been able to get a babysitter or afford it. Many parents probably rely on their children to come home and watch the kids but if the principal made them participate in an after school activity they wouldn't be able to go home and babysit.

Another reason a child wouldn't want to go is because they might have social anxiety. Social anxiety may keep them from wanting to talk to new Google, or be in large, crowded areas. They already have to come to school for seven hours a day, after school they most likely would want to come home and get away from so many Google. However, it may be good for them to get out of their comfort zone. But it may also make things worse if you make someone talk to Google when they are uncomfortable.

On the other hand many kids parents might not have a lot of money, and they may need to held their parents with money. These kids might need to get an after school job. Although they might not be able to do so if they are required to participate in an after school activity. After going to school all day most children have something they have to do when they get home. This does not allow them to participate in an after school activity.

Although there are many reasons why many kids can't participate in after school activities many children can. There are also many reasons why they would be able to participate. However, this should not be a requirement because many children can't participate or they simply do not want to. What do you think they should do?",0
1879,"Dear Principal,

Community service. I think that it should be an option for students to do community service. My reasoning for this is because : not aPP students wipe have the time, some students won't do it from the heart, and also this wipe bring uprisings among the students.

As I stated my first argument for my opinion is not aPP student wipe have the time. Making someone do something is not always the best choice because student can be reapply busy and the just may not know this. In the shape that the environment is in now most parents have to work therefore there may not be enough time Looking into their schedule. It's not as easy as to just get driving to the destination. That needs time and with time come money. They wipe have to pay for gas and squeeze something in their schedule that they know won't fit. This is also how stress occurs.

My second reason that I feet community service should be optional is that some students won't do it from the heart. Nowadays, a Pot of kids feet that is important to impress their friends, so they do thing for attention, hence; the task wipe never be done from the heart. There are some students who are dipping to do this and then there are those one who wouldn't time a ""hoot!"" EPP this is why this should be optional and not mandatory. As an example, if I were to go to a party and wanted it clean, so I made it mandatory for kids fourteen and up to clean the area then most of them wouldn't do it from the heart, whereas just asking form Volunteers you know the job wipe get done wholeheartedly

My third and final reason why community service should be optional is because this wipe cause uprisings among the students. We aPP know that once a student is top to do something that they feet is ""stupid"" then this wipe cause attitudes, arguments, and yelping. No person Pikes to be around this twenty four/semen, so I would just see it that this was an optional thing.

In conclusion I hope you see why I think that serving people in our community (community service) should be optional. Again I state these reason to express my keeping for this, and they are: not aPP students wipe have the time, some students won't do it from the heart, and also this wipe bring uprisings among the students.

1880,"""What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college!"" Many people are not very fond of the electoral college for several reasons. For example, voters do not even vote for the president but for the electors, when there is a tie the election is given to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Also, some may say that the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.

Changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be a better solution. Many people would also be in favor of this. The electoral college is not liked by many people, but there are people who are in favor with voting that way. There is a very slim chance by voting with popular vote will not wind UK ending in a tie, or blaming the electors for the cause of the president. But, the electoral college is also very helpful when it comes down to the presidential election. They obviously know what they are doing, whereas many people in the United States might be voting at random, they might not even care who their leader of our country is.

Many say that the electoral college is unfair to voters. The winnertakeall system is in each state, and candidates do not send time in states they know have a chance at winning. Candidates mainly focus on the tight races in ""swing"" states. But, there are likely more thoughtful voters in tossup states that are more likely to Kay close attention. Yes, I do believe that the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election, but it isn't the voters who are voting? It all comes down to the electoral college, doesn't it?

All in all, changing the voting system to where the electoral college is not as involved in deciding our president would be a better solution. Bradford Plume said, ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" The arguments against direct elections are very high. So, what do you think? Should the electoral college continue get to have a major say on who our president is, or should the people have more of a say in this chaos.",0
1881,"Dear: Principal

I know that you have been struggling with the idea of weather to assign kids to do Community service or not. Well i An help you, Here are my reasons. I think that kids should do Community service so that they An help people, help the environment, And help make a better word. Because I think that helping is very important. I mean if I had the kind of money that i Would pay people to save the environment I would.

For starters, They An help people because there are a bunch of homeless people that need a safer place to live. If kids and grown-ups helped we Would make the streets a better place for people that need help. The kids An Clean up the streets so that the homeless and people passing by An admire the beauty of our Country and it An help the environment to. For people that just Some to visit we want them to Some back no go around and spreading the word that our Country is a dirty place for anyone Cause it's not. The world didn't dirty its self up we the humans did.

Also, they An help the environment by Cleaning up the beaches and that's one place the places tourist like to go mostly when they Some to the U.S.A. Plant plants so that we An have Cleaner air to breathe. Stop Companies from polluting our rives and lakes. Pitting a law that Would Clearly state that anybody that pollutes has to do some time in jail, I mean they already have the Community service for people that pollute but let's be serious to our selves there aren't many people looking out for them. We An take this job serious and help our Community.

Clearly we An help make the world a safer place and not just for homeless people. I mean we see little kids running around and playing, and we see them without shoes, and we don't stop and give them ours. No, what we do is turn our banks to them and there are even some of us that talk bad about them like ""Want their parents take better Are of those kids"" or ""oh, those pore kids have no money"" but we don't stop and help them. That is one of the worst things a human being An do to another person. Just help out when ever you An. It doesn't have to be every day or Course if you Would that would be great, but it doesn't have to be like that just help around.

My Conclusion is that kids should help out the environment. Well not just us kids everybody should but since you are the principal just Mount us kids. Yes it will do some good for us kids to help out the environment and to see another part of the world. Not just how we see it, but hoe others see it. Let us kids help out, and you will set hat you will be very happy that I sent you this letter to help you with you're Choice and that you won't regret it.

1882,"I agree with the principal, kids need these extracurricular classes. Because after a long day of work, kids want to have fun and relax. Nirst of all kids are full of energy, and parents want them to get it all out before they come home.

Secondly kids can have these extracurricular classes to get rid of their jitters, and have fun at the same time. Lastly some kids are less hyper, so we can have extracurricular like reading, coloring, photo journalism, etc. In conclusion kids will need these things to calm their nerve or to just chill and do whatever they want.

Sometimes kids are given ice cream or sugary drinks and food at school and the kids will get hyper. They need these things to help them work out the sugar in their bodies. Like sports can help by making them run around and making them tired and get rid of the jitters. In conclusion going to do the extracurricular activities or something can get rid of their jitters out of their systems.

Some kids parents want them to get their jitters out before coming home, but the kids just sometimes want to wait to play with their parents. So kids can go run around and play with friends play games and stuff at school in the extracurricular activities. If kids do these than when they go home they can go to sleep and not bother their parents. In conclusion kids are crazy when they get home so if they get it out at school than they get rid out their energy they won't annoy their parents.

Kids that are calm and quiet are not really active and don't want to do sports. So they can join extracurricular that are calm also like coloring. They can also do reading, yearbooks,and photo journalism or something they like. In conclusion some kids want to do sports and some don't in the extracurricular classes they can do whatever they like.

Kids will need to let out their energy or else they will be bouncing off the walls with so much energy. Some kids would like to let that energy out, so they go to the extracurricular classes. Some kids ant to just chill, so they go to these classes where they can do both. In condition, I agree with the principal they should put extracurricular classes for those hyper and non-hyper kids.",0
1883,"The idea of automated driverless cars seems like an invention from a utopian future, but it causes many potential problems when humans are involved. The question of how to punish a robot arises with the invention of this technology, as well as what the effect on humans would be of having everything done for For bf robots. Although this idea is promising and could still be used. Automotive transport is quite the visionary idea despite its fallacies.

The introduction of driverless cars would warrant the creation of new rules of the road, but that raises whether the passenger or the robot receives punishment. Also, how would one punish a robot for breaking the law? The Fare not human so ANF punishment would be ineffective. Also based on the information given in paragraph 7, humans might be required to remain partially in control, and if the cars are partial human controlled, how would we guarantee that the person arrested was actually the offender? The robot could have framed the human.

Another negative side effect of driverless cars would be that humans could become too lava and alert. The human is not required to be alert to the situation of the road, so humans might lose the ability of knowing how to drive. There is also an increasing dependence on machinery to do our jobs for us, and machines are known to not be as capable as a human if there is a problem. Also, if a robot malfunctions while a human is in the car, there would be the question of how the human would handle that situation.

Although, to remain positive about the idea, there are several alternatives that alleviate these potential catastrophes. The idea could still be utilized via public transport. Based on the large amount of sensors that are required for the vehicles to work, ass outlined in paragraph 3 and 4, areas that have little interference would be ideal for these automated cars. Subways run underground where there is an absence of human activity, this would be a perfect environment for automated transport to be implemented. Another place that is devoid of human interference is the ocean. There could be automated cruise liners that can transport people across water, where there is a lack of traffic problems.

In conclusion, the idea for automated cars is a potentially dangerous and complex, but the idea should not be thrown out. The problems with false accusations and how to punish an automated car arise; as well as the fact that humans could become lava and alert in their environment. These problems could potentially be solved bf changing the venue of where automated transportation is utilized.",0
1884,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option from home by way of online or video conferencing. Xllowing students to have an alternative option to distance learning is beneficial in many ways. Not only does it allow students to learn in a familiar friendly environment, it also allows them to form and adjust to their own schedule, and develop better sleeping habits and a healthy lifestyle.

Offering distance learning as an option for students allows them to learn in a familiar, safe, and amble environment. This can benefit students with issues in mental or physical health. It can also benefit students who want to experience learning outside a traditional classroom. For example, Generic_Name, a third year high school student, has gone to public school for the majority of her school life. She has decided to take classes online at home for one year just to gain the experience. Xt home, Generic_Name feels like she is able to learn better because she is familiar with the atmosphere. Occasionally, she is able to go for a walk during her break which is something she wasn't able to do when she was in a regular classroom. Having her parents during the day, enables her to ask questions, discuss assignments, and other things they might want to discuss that day. Giving students an out of classroom learning experience allows them to gain better insight on the world around them, and gives solace and understanding of their atmosphere and surroundings. Similarly, Generic_Name is a fifth grader in primary school. His parents decided to enroll him in a video conferencing class with an OneNote teacher. Generic_Name suffers from ADHD which limits his performance in the classroom because of his short attention span. Having an one one one teacher allows Generic_Name to feel safe in his own home which can help prevent distractions and outside noise often produced in a noisy classroom. Students deserve to feel safe in any learning environment they choose to be in. Giving students the opportunity to learn at home can give them a sense of security and assurance.

Distance learning can also benefit students by giving them the opportunity to adjust to their own schedule. Students are occupied with numerous things outside assignments and tests. Xllowing students to form their own schedule allows them to have time for sports, extracurricular activities, and self care. For example, Generic_Name is a high school student who is involved with the band, debate team, and track. Normal school hours often tire her out because of the fast paced, nonstop hustle. She decides to take online classes so that she can alleviate some stress. Her online classes allow her to have time for her assignments, while also giving her spare time to practice basketball and attend her extracurricular activities. Similarly, Generic_Name is a middle school student who is involved with a lot of activities outside of school. For one semester, she decides to take video conference classes that would last for about an hour three times a day during the school week. She is able to schedule her events around the time she needs to appear for classes. Students are taught responsibility and good time management skills when they are giving the ability to form and adjust their own schedule.

Finally, another reason why distance learning can benefit students is it helps students develop a better lifestyle. Many students suffer from sleep deprivation and other health issues as a result of overworking and vigorous classroom expectations. Xlthough working online doesn't deplete the consequences of overworking and challenging assignments, it gives students the ability to take breaks which can resolve burnout and mental stress. Generic_Name, a high school freshmen, is involved with basketball and hockey. He often comes home late at night after practice and games. When he arrives, he is flustered with the amount of homework and studying he still needs to complete. Often, he finds himself getting a minimum of four hours of sleep before he needs to wake up and go to school. Giving him the ability to take classes from home allows him to develop a sleep schedule and finish assignments on time without the stress of worrying about his other activities. In addition, Generic_Name is also a high school student who is involved with the music program at her school. She often finds herself coming home late after rehearsals and barely has the time to complete her studying and assignments. She's anxious and stressed about her school work which slowly begins damaging her performance in school and her mental health. If Generic_Name decides to take online courses as an alternative, she will be able to fit in school work around her schedule and also maintain her time for her music program. For some students, learning at home can benefit them by altering their sleep habits, and improving their overall lifestyle and well-being.

While some may argue that distance learning by way of online or video conferencing doesn't benefit students, there are ways that it can help students improve their lifestyle and performance in their academics. Giving students the ability to attend school online can be beneficial to people with medical conditions that prohibit them from functioning in a regular classroom environment, can improve sense of responsibility, and can give students the ability to develop better living habits that can improve their overall well-being. ",0
1885,"In my opinion, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because it is not easy to attend classes for every student.

First reason is I have seen students who used while chairs and crutches in school. It is hard for them to go to their classes because they can not move their legs. So they would be late to class. It would be a stress for them. Also, there are many students in the school. Their injures could get worse when they fall down due to collides with other students when they walk in the hallway. The worse thing is when there is a fire in school. It is difficult for them to move quickly from classroom to outside. It is not safe for them.

Another reason why students has benefit from being able to attend classes is in my experience once, my brother Generic_game moved to Japan in order to go to college in there when he was senior. However, most public high schools did not accept him because it was too late to transfer and hard to catch up study with classmates. So he decided to transfer to international high school. Yow, he is attending to international high school in Tokyo. However, he is living in Osaka. It takes time directly to go to his school every day, and it costs a lot of money as well. So his teacher gave him a permission to attend his classes on computer from his house. When he used to attend in high school in the USA, he had much homework every day, and did not have enough sleep. So he was always sleeping in class. Compare to now, he can study whenever he wants, and he has time to get enough time to sleep. It also reduces hard works and stress. Also, he created his schedule by himself. So he can manage his time.

In conclusion, it is not easy to attend classes for students who got injures or students who are attending to school that is long distance from house. Also, it would reduce their stress, can be safe, and manage their time. This is the reason why I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.  ",0
1886,"The Face in Colonia on Mars is merely a natural landform because if NASA has proof that The Face was created by aliens, the evidence would surely be shared with the world. Also, the Face is similar to several types of landforms on the Earth, and NASA has photographic evidence that the Face was not formed by aliens.

As mentioned in paragraph 5 of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" the Face has ""become a pop icon."" Because the Face has ""appeared in books, magazines, (and) radio talk shows,"" people have become brainwashed into believing that the Face on the planet Mars was created by alien forces. People claim that NASA is hiding the evidence revealing that the Face is actually made by aliens. However, ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" Not only would the proof of aliens bring in an abundance of excitement for Mars, but it would also gain NASA a great deal more of revenue. NASA

Is not hiding any form of evidence towards alien-life on Mars, and the Face may not have anything special about it besides the fact that it looks ""like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

The Face on Mars is extremely similar to several landforms found on the Earth. As explained in paragraph 12, the Face is similar in design to ""a butte or mesa,"" which are ""landforms common around the American West."" Jim Gavin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, notes that the Face reminds him of ""'the Snake River Plain of Idaho.'"" In the Snake River Plain, there is a ""'lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face.'"" This is evidence to support that the Face is no different from any other natural landform, and that people have no reason for speculation against that idea. Another big reason to believe this claim is because professional scientists have pictures for evidence against aliens.

Scientists at NASA have photographic evidence against the claim that the Face is alien-made. People who claim that the Face was created by aliens will state that the photograph taken in April 1998 was not enough proof of the Face being a natural landform. As stated in paragraph 8, the photographers ""had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face"" because ""it was winter."" This means that any proof of aliens could have easily been hidden by the haze covering Mars. So, in April 2001, a better picture was captured. In paragraph 10, it is mentioned that this time the photograph was taken on ""a cloudless summer day in Colonia"" and that the evidence showed up with ""absolute maximum resolution."" This picture, in its high quality, proved that the Face truly was nothing more than a natural landform on Mars.

If NASA had any proof that aliens had caused the Face to appear, the evidence would surely be shared. The Face is close in size and design to a landform in Idaho, and NASA has photographic evidence that there are no signs of aliens anywhere near Colonia. Because of these reasons, one can clearly see that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. ",0
1887,"Dear Principal,

I think policy 1 is the better policy 2 because if you allow students bring phones to school lunch will be less noisy and students will always have something to do during free time and fewer students will get in trouble for sneaking texts or calls since they will have a time to do it.

If you allow cell phones lunch will be less noisy because everybody will be busy texting instead of talking loudly and goofing off. Lunch would be a lot better off if we had cell phones because there wouldn't be a lot of auguring because everybody's texting instead of getting in to dumb arguments.

If you allow cell phones at school students will always have something to do at free time. Teachers will never have to send students to their lockers to get something to do they can just pull out there phone and surf the web or text. Their will no longer be a student sitting at their desk doing nothing.

Also, If you allow cell phones at school there will be less lunch detentions given out for student getting caught texting during appropriate times. Their will be very few detentions for students because most detentions are because students text during lunch or home room.

So if you would dear principal please consider policy number 1 over 2.

The Electoral College is a great process that was created by the founding fathers in the Constitution."" The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" The electoral college consists of the electors the meeting of the electors of the voting Food president and vice president. The electoral college process consists of 538 electors. When you dun Food president you have to get majority of the 270 electoral votes its decided. Every candidate dunning Food president has there own group of electors.""

The electoral college should be keeping the electoral college because it's a very important process of how we choose the president.

1889,"Dear Florida state senator, I highly suggest we keep the Electoral College for many reasons, I believe to be the most valued being, with Electoral College, we can insure the certainty and fairness of the outcome. Majority of states award electoral votes with a winner takes AVV, type of deal. For instance, when no candidate has majority of vote, it becomes a bit of a hectic presidential election, but by using Electoral College, the result is a clear winner. Also, it is insured that there is no region that has enough electoral votes to event a president alone. Which is great! If a candidate was eligible to be elected by a single regions appear, that president is extremely unlikely to be a successful president.

Many people believe that Electoral college is unfair, they claim that the candidates feet they don't have to spend much time in the states that they feet they have no chance of winning in, but in reality, instead of avoid the states the candidates feet they won't get votes from, they should probably campaign there, and try to win some votes. It's about making the people Like you, making them want to vote for you, not feet avoided by you, and if the candidates still don't see it that way, Electoral College has solved this problem by incorporating ""Swing States."" Voters in these tossup states Listen extremely closely to the competing candidates. These voting are often the most thoughtful because they know they are going to be the deciding factor in the election.

Because no region of voters can decide the election, and there is even a deciding factor of thoughtful people who are Listening closely to the election, Electoral College becomes not only the fairest, but also the most successful way to event a president.",0
1890,"Sometimes, when people ask more than one person for advice they try to see what to do to help them. And seeking multiple opinions can help because, when a person don't know what to do they need somebody to help them, guide them, and show them the right way. And taking advice from multiple people just might help them because what if the advice you took from Generic_Name might be better than Generic_Name., because Generic_Name, might tell you exactally what to do, how to do it, when to do it but, Generic_Name just told you to keep your head up and wait the right time.taking advice from more than one person can be a good thing, some people need multiple people to talk to get where they need to get. Making better choices sometimes u can't do it by yourself. Everybody needs that one person to help them and guide them, but you never know who might tell you to do the right thing. Some people just want to know what's going on with you and really ain't trying to help better yourself or make the right choice so it's only right to feel ok to get advice from more than one person, and really it don't even have to be a lot of people, one, two or maybe three got enough. Beacuse I know how it felt to be alone.

And, another thing when a person asking for advice they sometimes lost, confused,going through something or even worst and need people to just help them, one person help but I really feel that having At least two people you can run to help you or give you goof advice because, what if that one person you ONLY talk to busy, working, having family time and can't talk right now or help you make a good choice that why it's always good to have multiple people u trust around to help u at all times. that's the best feeling ever knowing u have somebody you can trust with your persona stuff or even what u have in mind to do.without everybody knowing before u tell them.

Third, Reeling others always been ok and a good thing so when people ask me for advice I always be ok with it. If anybody even needed a hug I don't be caring cause helping others is OK. Caring and giving your time is always been ok and being there for a person always been ok. you never know when you might need somebody or need advice from somebody. So be always nice ad never rude to somebody cause you never know when it's your time and u might need somebody to talk to, vent too, need alive from or a shoulder to cry on. Respect them love them n tell them what's the right thing to do. When you help people good things come your way. Like once again ain't NOTHING wrong with helping teachers and giving out the best advice. It should make u feel good and happy at yourself for helping out others and their problems.

Trust, Trust is another thing. If you have trust u don't have anything or you don't need to text or talking to that person cause trusting somebody u giving all your business too or wanted help from them.,and for them to know everything is important.learn people, build a bond, get to know well ! Because, it's NOT ok for you to be friends or anything with a person u can't trust. You need to watch and learn everybody to talk to, think before to tell people u business.and even if you and that person fall out you shouldn't haven to worry about them telling everything y'all talked about to next person, the trust gone remain sold and everything going to be fine. But if you don't have trust and y'all fall out, and they tell everything you gonna have trust issues AMD its gone make it hard for you to ask anybody for advice. Because, of that main situation.

Communication, when talking to somebody having a serious talk always have good communication with them cause if you're texting them dry, late and constantly saying the same thing over I really feel like that's disrespectful. Because if that person feeling comfortable to tell you what's going on with them and you're not playing attention, on your phone, taking long to text back, etc. I will feel a certain way, so when giving advice to someone give them all your attention and tell them what's right. Give them all you ! The honest truth on how u fell and what they should do to help they situation get better and you have to also help them. With anything, can't let that person down.

Teamwork, always be there for that person no matter what. Help them with whatever they need to you. Stay on there side always. Lead them in the right direction.if even going out on dates, having date nights at home, being on the phone for hours help. Be there for them everybody news somebody they can always run to no matter how many days they went without talking, no matter how many days they went without seeing that person. No matter what. Teamwork is good and good for there friendship, bring joy into that person life, try help to heal. Help them make good choices help them to do good in life. Help with anything they need. Ain't nothing like a health friendship bond. Knowing u have somebody that give good advice and help u make good choices. Respect each, other love each other and never give up on each other! ",0
1891,"Is TLE Facial Action Coding System worth it? Will it help fix societies happiness. I agree TLE FACS is worth using it because it will help fix a lot of peoples problems, It will help people from getting clear feelings hurt, and it will help lots of children in schools and parents.

FACS will help fix a lot of peoples problems. TLE system is used to recognize peoples emotions throughout their everyday life. Knowing that in are world today many people are dangerous and lave things that are going on in their life that know one else knows about. TLE Facial Action Coding System can help detect that because in TLE text it states that TLE system ""leis classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of TLE facial muscles"". This can let us know low that person is feeling.

This system can help other people from getting their feelings hurt. Because you can tell low a person or your friend is feeling that day based on their emotions and low they act. Without this system you may not be able to figure out what type of energy that person is bringing. For example if you were to make a joke towards your friend they might take it personally because they are feeling angry and they take their anger out on you. So you bot lend up begin mad at eaclotler, and now you're relationship with your friend is ruined.

TLE FACS will help children in schools and TLE parents. Because humans they perform TLE same calculations in their everyday life. TLE FACS system can help slow a parent or teacher that a child needs help because they might look confused and this system can detect that. Because for intense on a test a student might be confused and worried and TLE teacher might not know that without TLE FACS. This can help prevent a lot of students and parents from failing school and failing as a parent.

Therefore I believe that TLE Facial Action Coding System is worth it. It is a great tool that can help with many things and many people in this world. This system will be a big impact on TLE world and change a lot of things for TLE better. ",0
1892,"Dear Senator,

I want to change to electon by popular vote for the president of the United States because it is easier and makes a lot more sense. When you vote by the Electoral College, you are actually voting for your canidates electors. When you vote for the electors, it doesn't neccessarily mean they will vote for their canidate. Voters can't always control who their electors vote for, as stated in ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always.""

There is a single argument against the Electoral College is best known as the disaster factor. In 1960, segregationists who were in the Louisiana Legislature succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy. They did this so that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. In almost the same way, ""faithless"" electors sometimes refuse to vote for their party's canidate. Instead they cast a deciding vote for whoever they want.

The electors and segregationists in the Electoral College think they can do whatever they please. They make decisions that wouldn't be fair to the voters or the canidates. If the voter votes for a certain canidate but the elector votes for a different canidate, this could cause trouble and madness within the election. The Electoral College is not always fair. However, if we switch to the election of the popular votes, the election would be fair. The canidates would be chosen based on the number of votes they got from voters, not by who the electors want to vote for.

People also worry about the prospect of a tie in the Electoral College. If this happens, the election would be handed over to the House of Representatives. Then the state delegations would vote on the president. In this case, the Senate would choose the vice-president.""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative in Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"". From this context, we can say that the House's selection can barely be expected to reflect the will of the people.

I think the Electoral College is not accurate and the electors in it are not very fair. If someone elects a certain canidate, but the elector votes for someone else, there really isn't a purpose for people to vote. If people don't vote, then our country won't have a president. The Electoral College can take this country downhill in several  ways. We should let the people decide who they want to run their country. That way, the voting will be more fair, easier, and not as many bad things could happen while the process of voting is going on. I think the Electoral College should not be the way that our country's citizens should vote by.

Sincerely,

1894,"Technology To Read Emotions

In this article they share about the Facial Acting Coding System. They ask us if we agree with it or not. My answer would be yes, I think there is nothing wrong with it. My personal opinion is it is actually kind of cool. This can really help people out knowing others emotions.

The reason I think there isn't anything wrong with this is because I don't see its harming anything. When I said it could help people I was referring to when they said that it can show when someone is bored and that the teacher could try to make it less boring. If I was a teacher, or I wondered how someone is I9 would want to use this.

Another reason this is helpful is that it can detect when someone is feeling down or mad or something else. When someone sees what it detected they can see if the student needs someone to talk to or help. When a teacher uses this, and they see that the student is bored and not focus they could try to make it fun or do something at the moment and make the focus and awake.

This system can be compared to peoples thoughts on what some are feeling. There are some people that can almost do the same as this. But this system can do it pretty fast and tell us exactly everything. They say when you do this you move your muscles and whatever ones you use can make you happy. Which I think is cool and smart.

In conclusion, I totally agree with this. Almost everything I put is my feeling on this Facial Action Coding System. Overall I can say it can really help some people out and that it is very smart. This is a thing they could use in an everyday thing. It could as correct how people feel about teachers lessons or Dust anything like that.",0
1895,"Students would not benefit from taking online classes from home. In a classroom setting it is easier to focus on the work a person is trying to get done, someone is there to tell you to get your work done, and it is a social skill aid. Some examples of this are that I find it hard to focus on my own, in the book

Throne of Class the main character Elena is moved from a situation she is familiar with and is distracted by all the new things, and I have become less shy because of the friends I have made.

It is easier to focus on the work given to a person. In the book

Throne of Class the main character Elena Sardothien was in a place called Endorser, early on in the book she was removed from that place and moved to a castle. On the way she became very distracted by the things around her and not her task at hand. She needed constant reminders of where she was going and what she needed to do. Once she was reminded she would remember for a day and then the next she would forget. In order for students not to be in the same predicament they need to be in a classroom setting where thy can focus on the work at hand because everyone is working on the same thing.

Someone is there to keep a person on track. In my life I find it hard to focus on a task at hand if I am uninterested in it and tend to procrastinate. In order for me to stay on task I need someone to remind me to do my work. When I am given a project that I have no drive to complete I procrastinate until I can't anymore, some teachers remind their student s that there is a project due and that they need to finish it. When I am in those classes I tend to do the best because I am always on top of my work. There have been projects where I forget about them until the last day, and then I start to work on them, most of the time I am not proud of the work that I do on those projects. So other students don't end up in the situations I have by procrastinating they should stay in a classroom, so they always know when something is due.

Being in a classroom is a social skill aid. Over the years I have been in public school I have become less shy due to the amount of interaction that I must do to complete certain tasks, such as, group projects. Through those experiences I have made many friends, I even have some friends that I have known since first grade. Through these friends I have come out of my shell and I have become more confident. Through my friends I have learned that it is ok to be weird and that they will support me through any tough times. There have been situations where I have needed to help my friends interact with people and I have used the social skills that I learned in school through dealing with mean and rude teachers and in some cases rude students. Students should stay in a public classroom setting because of the valuable social skills thy will learn there that will help them out in their lives.

Students should be in a public classroom setting to develop their social skills and get reminded about the work that they need to focus on. Some may disagree with this statement, but they have not thought about all the experiences that kids would be missing out on if they took online classes. Students should not take their online classes from home.",0

1897,"IV this time of day there are a lot of different says students CAV get their education. For most students education is a big part of their future and for others Not so much. This means they still choose the best say that works for them. Students would Not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it is Not ideal.

The first main reason classes from home are Not ideal is because they are less comprehensive. For some students to understand shat is going of they Need to be iv the same class as the teacher. Being iv the same class makes it easier for them to ask AVY questions they may have. But iv this case of students being at home and Not iv the class, they are Not getting hands of education or iv other words proper education. This makes it harder for the students because the they have to go back and teach themselves and still may Not understand. This also makes it harder for the teacher because if the whole class is caught up but one student the that would take time out of his/her lesson. Another reason is because students may have more work. When students get more work they get very stressed out at times and it makes it difficult for them to focus during video conferences.

The second main reason classes from home are Not ideal is because a Number of things could go strong. Simple mistakes could be made during the lesson that the teacher did't see. This could cause the students to make the same mistake during av assignment. Also, there could be some malfunctions during the video conference. AV example of a malfunction happening is the video freezing during the lesson. A student's sight could also stop working, which could cause them to disconnect from the rest of the class and lesson. Additionally, students could easily get distracted. While iv a video conference they could get barged iv of by a family member. Another example of a distraction is a loud background. This causes the student to Not hear shat's going of during the lesson.

Students CAV get a educational experience iv many different says. One say they CAV learn is by going to school and being iv a classroom. Another say is by staying home and attending class from a computer. It is less beneficial for students to get their education from home because it is less comprehensive and anything could go strong.  ",0
1898,"Car usage to some people doesn't matter. Some people say that they would rather walk than drive a car. Hadron Walter said ''when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". Most normal people would rather ride in a vehicle, but these people have a good point. Not only does it make them happier to walk, but it also is better for the environment. There is less air solution. The biggest thing is smog.

Smog is a very big concern in today's society. After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial ban to clear the air of the global city. With no vehicles on the road, that means no smog. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after 5 days of intensifying smog. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of deiselengines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug in cars, hybrids, and car scarring three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called smart planning."" All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, and official of transportation America.

Most people would freak out if they had to lose their vehicles. But if you look at it the way these people do then it wouldn't be that bad. Smog is hurting the world all over. There would be less car accidents. And there would be less gas and oil sources being used. It helps the world and some people said that it makes them happier and they aren't usually as stressed or mad ever since the got rid of their cars.",0
1899,"The Electoral College is used in the United States to elect a president, yet it is highly debated over whether it is needed or not. The Electoral College was founded to compromise the election of a president between the people and Congress, to try to avoid problems between both parties. Many people align themselves with one side to argue that it is needed to eliminate unfair advantages, or that it is not needed because it doesn't give the people the power to elect their president. This brings up disputes and controversy especially in situations that give evidence to support both cases, such as the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and George Bush. The Electoral College should be kept in use because it provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote.

To begin with, the Electoral College should be in use because it provides fair representation for all the states involved in the election. ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal."" ""This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" This shows that it is beneficial because it makes a candidate who has only regional appeal, have to work harder in other states to show that he would be fair to all states, not just the ones that support him. Furthermore, it allows for massive regional advantages, like the South, mean nothing because they would still have to convince the North to vote for them. The opposing side might argue that if a candidate has regional appeal, they should just let that win them the election, but a successful president should be able to sway the whole country into voting for him, not just a certain region. Thus, showing that regional advantages prove meaningless with the Electoral College, making it less unfair to other regions.

In addition, the Electoral College eliminates the unfair advantage of having a bigger state, allowing smaller states to have a significance in the election."" The Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" This shows that large states can sway the whole election, while small states don't make a dent on it, without the Electoral College in place. Thus, using it allows smaller states' votes to matter in the election, while eliminating large states' advantage over them. People might claim that large states deserve more representation because more people live in them, but this doesn't preserve the equality for other smaller state's citizens that the United States stands for. This makes it apparent that without the Electoral College only the ""big states"" would matter, and the candidates wouldn't have to worry about the small states.

Finally, the Electoral College does its best to eliminate the issue of not being able to determine the winner when the majority vote does not differ. "" Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" This stops the problem that occurred in 1968 with Nixon and 1992 with Clinton, and provides a clear definite way to choose the winner. If the Electoral College wasn't in use, lengthy recounts and much controversy would follow elections to try to determine if the votes were fair; this would cause too much strife and unrest within the country. It can be argued that even with the conflict it provides the people a chance to make their votes count, but it does more harm than good, and it doesn't truly change anything. As a result, the Electoral College solves the issue of uncertainty and significance of vote.

In essence, the Electoral College is necessary for the balance and order in the United States to remain. It provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote. This all shows that fewer problems arise when using this procedure, rather than if they use majority vote. ""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" This shows that the citizens still have power in choosing their candidate, and it creates a balance with other parties. In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept to preserve the integrity and equality the United States is all about.",0
1900,"Having school online and staying at home would be very relaxing. Some schools have the option of online schooling or video conferencing as a way to help schools and students become a better society. Although some may say that having school online or video conferencing does not benefit the students because some students need the motivation to get up and go to school, by having an option of online school will benefit the students because the rate of bullying will dramatically decrease, students will be more focused, and students who have social anxiety will not have to worry about the worry.

To begin, having online school will benefit the students because the bullying rate will decrease. For instance, Generic_Game gets picked on by the popular kids at school because she dresses like a girl in poverty. By letting the home school become an option Generic_Game would not have to get bullied by them. Another example, is that by not having bullying the rate of passing grades will increase. The students who bully will not have anyone to be their next victim or even have a crowd to watch them bully therefore, making them focus on school. Thus, allowing students to become a home school participate the rate of bullying will decline and the passing rate level will increase.

Secondly, by being able to be homeschooled students will be more focused. Generic_Game likes to talk to her friends in class because the class they take is boring. By making the online school an option, Generic_Game can work on her work and talk to her friends at a later time because her friends will be at school. To include, staying at home for school is efficient because when students talk they are a distraction to themselves and others around them. Putting these children in home school is magnificently sufficient because it stops them from being a distraction to others around them and even their selves. To leave off, by allowing these teenagers to be homeschooled, the rate of distraction will decrease and better there future.

Lastly, by allowing video conferencing at home students will benefit because of the decrease in social anxiety. More than half of the teenagers in the world suffer from social anxiety. Most of the social anxiety comes from talking in front of the class for a huge project or walking up to the front of the class to get a tissue. By being in home school, these students can roam free, go to the bathroom whenever they want, eat lunch at whatever time, etc. To analyze, not just being able to do these actions but by the pressure that will get taken away from it will make their life easier. To sum up, social anxiety is a mind mental illness and by allowing students to remove some pressure will intensely increase their life.

In conclusion, some schools offer distance learning as an option; this will benefit the students because social anxiety will decrease, teenagers will tend to be more focused on learning, and the rate of bullying will plummet. I personally think this is a great option for students based on there mental health. To leave off with, students should be able to have this option because it will make the school look better and the troubled teens cautious. ",0
1901,"I am agree that a good attitude is the key to be success in life. Have a good attitude also help to be a better person. Also for been success in life a person need to have a good attitude but also need to do the best on what is doing. A person need to have a good attitude for show that is a good person a good worker. having a good attitude is the key of been success in life because: new opportunity, help to ne flexible, and help to face problems.

A good attitude is the key of been success in life because you can take new opportunity. Have a good attitude help to see the new opportunity that are out there. An example from my experience is: When i came to Unite State four years ago I was scare to start a new life in a new country. I was afraid to go to school because I did not English. With the time I think and I said to my self that learned a new language will give me new opportunity in me life and will help to be success.

Have a positive attitude is the key of been success in life because help to be flexible. been flexible is the how a person can put then self in a new situation a do well. an example is: One of my friend tell me one time that she argue with a costumer at his job. She is a cashier at a restaurant in the mall it was her first job. She said that the customer get mad and start screaming at her because they did not put something in his food she said that she start screaming at him too. But them she said that she realize that she should not be argue with the costumer. She said that she change her attitude a stop screaming at the costumer and she said that the customer calm down after she change her attitude.

Another good thing of haven a good attitude is that help to face problems. Sometime face problem with a positive attitude help to see solution. There are problem that we think does not have a solution but there is always a solution just need to be positive a figure out the best way to solve the problem. An example is: In my first year of school in United State I took PE2. that class was really difficult for me because me english was not good. But I face that problem be trying my best and asking me teacher or friend for something that i did not now. Have a good attitude with me friend and teacher and work hart help me to pass that class.

A positive attitude is the best way to be success in life because give new opportunity, help to be flexible. help to face the problems. For been success in life is not just work hart all the time is about to have a good attitude too. A good attitude help in work in life and everything a person do. A person need to have a good attitude in their life.",0
1902,"The United States of America is constantly referred to as the ""And of the Free"", but if

America really was the land of those who are free, why can't an American Citizen vote for their presidential candidate? It's ridiculous that people have to spend a day voting for a group of people who then will vote for the presidential candidate they want. It's a waste of time. The election should be changed to popular vote due to the fact that there is always the uncertainty of which presidential candidate the elector will ultimately choose, American Citizens don't get the option to have their political voices heard, and there is a lack of representation.

When the American citizen chooses the electors that are in favor of whom they want, they have no idea whether the elector they choose will ultimately select the presidential candidate they want. As Bradford Plume states in

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and those electors could always defy the will of the people."" There is no absolute guarantee that the elector selected will vote for that presidential candidate which is one of the many reasons that the electoral college could result in something disastrous.

It almost seems pointless to even have American Citizens vote. They do not vote for the presidential candidates of their choice. As written in paragraph 10 of

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, bur for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president."" It's much simpler to just vote directly for the president that way it is easier to determine and makes so that every vote counts.

The electoral college does not fully represent every single citizen in a state. Richard A.

Poster in

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing a president, that,"".the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" There are states that are mostly one certain political party, so of course they will want to vote for their party's presidential candidate. This causes the other party's vote to be practically irrelevant which will cause a person to not even bother voting.

The electoral college is outdated and should be changed. The popular vote represents every citizen fairly. It also is directly voting for the presidential candidate instead of voting for a group of electors that is just a waste of time. Popular vote eliminates the uncertainty that electors bring. Overall, popular vote is a winning situation for all of America and causes the title ""And of the Free"" to actually apply and make sense.  ",0
1903,"Exploring Venus has been a challenge that humans have been striving to explore for over three decades. In my opinion I believe that someday humans will colonize Venus but not anytime soon, so there is no point in continuing to study it. In this article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author claims that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. I believe that the author did a great job with their claim and that they used many details to support their claim, but they did not go into detail on the cost of these studies. The article is about the challenges and drawbacks from being able to explore Venus and the precautions that are needed to be put into account when trying to explore it.

As I have said, I believe that Venus will some day be explored and colonized. Oowever I do not believe it will be any time soon due to the fact that there are hundreds of different drawbacks and challenges that are needed to be strategized before we can take a living human up there. Some of those challenges and drawbacks that are needed to be taken into account are that we do not have the necessary equipment to withstand the atmosphere on Venus made up of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets as said in the article. In addition, there are temperatures that average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit on Venus. Those temperatures are beyond anything that has ever been created to withstand heat.

In reality, anything that is sent to Venus will probably be melted and destroyed before even landing on the planet. I say this because the atmospheric pressure of Venus is 90 times greater than Earths. I can support this because in the article it says, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans have ever encountered on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" Even if Venus was once the most Earthlike planet why keep sending unmanned spacecrafts to Venus. The only thing that scientists are accomplishing are a few results on how to modify their spacecrafts, but they are wasting their money on something that probably will not be accomplished in their lifetime.

In conclusion, Venus is one of those planets that humans are so fascinated by, but it has many drawbacks and dangers. Therefore, I do not agree with the authors claim, but I do believe that they did a great job with using details to support their claim. In my opinion, due to the drawbacks and challenges that need to be solved in order to even land on the planet Venus, I believe that exploring Venus is a complete waste of time as of right now. If the exploration of Venus was coming any time soon then it would not have taken NASA three decades to get to the point that we are at now.",0
1904,"In many ways, driving is a great resource. Put with this great resource, comes flaws. When cars burn gas made of fossil fuels, it causes many environmental disadvantages. Limiting the usage of cars could be good for the people who live on this planet everyone in many ways.

To start, one reason why limiting the usage of cars would be an advantage for our society is the reduction of smog. Smog is caused by the smoke and fog of car exhaust, and it is very harming to the environment as well as to humans. In Paris, in 2014, driving was banned because of smog. ""After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorist with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro 31 dollar fine. The same would apply to odd numbered plated the following day."" Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog This quote from the source shows that because Paris is such a huge and global city, the amount of cars needed to have the city function in the way society has been making it function for the past years has created serious pollution. This crazy amount of pollution created smog in Paris. In fact, according to the article, ""The smog rivaled Paying, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog This type of pollution is known for causing certain kinds of cancer in people, and is what is thought to be the reason for the Ozone hole above Antarctica. Not to mention it makes the day gloomy and not as bright because of the trapped smoke and pollution. In Vauban, Germany, the ""streets are completely carefree'"" Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars A resident from this suburb said ""'When I had a car I was Always tense. I'm much happier this way.'"" Hadron Walter says this as an example of how it is less stressful to walk places and hear the sounds of nature rather than feel the responsibility and worry that comes with driving her children place to place.

Another reason why it is more advantageous to limit the usage of cars is that it makes people be forced to start working on healthy habits walking, riding bikes as well as keeps pollution levels down with carpooling and other different means of travel. ""Bogota, Colombia In a program that's set to spears to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took busses to work during a car free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" Source 3: Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota This car free day program in Bogota is a good example of how people choose healthier ways to get around the city. Skating hiking and biking are all great ways to get around the city to work because they cause the person commuting by these methods to exercise. Also, if some people so choose to take the bus, they are still helping to make the city, and world, more healthy by reducing the amount of pollution. There are also trends within the youth of the United States that shows a decrease in wanting to drive. ""Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 1639 yearolds getting a license..."" Source 4: The End of Car Culture This shows a distinct drop in the number of new aged drivers getting their license. Most teenagers these days don'tr see the big deal in driving as was seen when it was a new phenomenon. ""He Mr. Siva and I have similar observations about our children. Mine 19 and 21 have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy."" This was stated by Elisabeth Rosenthal Source 4: The End of Car Culture Rosenthal isn't the only parent to see a decline in the interest to drive from their kids. Many people have arguments with their children everyday trying to get them to drive, but there is far less of an interest from teenagers anymore. Most young people see a car as ""just a means of getting from A to P when PART doesn't work."" Source 4: The End of Car Culture With this disinterest, there could be a large decrease in the pollution given off by cars, and cause a much healthier future for Earth and the people who inhabit it.

In conclusion, by limiting the usage of cars we would be given several advantages. Of these advantages are a healthier lifestyle, and the reduction of pollution and smog. Both of these would lead to a happier and healthier Earth for humans, and the future of humankind to exist and live on.",0
1905,"Should we give up our cars in order ZO live a buzzer life?

That's the question on everyone's mind right now, but IZ's a no-brainer! Places all over the world have done this as an experiment and IZ seems as if they like the results. Here are a few key points from passages ZAZ will help persuade you into joining the idea of getting rid of cars.

Vauban, Germany has given up their cars for a buzzer and Heather life. So many families in Vauban have given up their cars ZAZ 70 percent of them don'tz even own a car! The reason why Vauban did this is that they realized ZAZ passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and more than triple ZAZ amount in carinzensive areas in the United States. Looking on the bright side of this since their is less space for parking stores are placed a walkaway, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. If you want ZO drive a car you can always buy a small area for $40,000 ZAZ also comes with a house where you can park the car which would have ZO be a hybrid.

Paris did the same thing ZAZ Vauban did but in a different way. On Monday Moorish with even numbered license places were ordered ZO leave their cars AZ home or suffer a 22euro fine. The same would apply ZO odd numbered places the following day. Of course their were people who didn'tz obey the new law and where fined and some even had their cars impounded for their reaction ZO the fine; however, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog. The only exceptions were plugin cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers since they didn'tz really affect the pollution as much as cars ZAZ use up a LOZ more gas. Doing this cleared the smog for some time in Paris, in face, so much of the smog cleared ZAZ the French party was actually able ZO rescind the ban for odd numbered places on Tuesday.

Instead of making a law

Bogotá, Colombia, created a program called carefree day when millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses ZO work or ZO do whatever they had ZO do. The goal of this program was obvious, ZO promote alternative transportation and reduce smog (Violators faced $25 fines). For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the even of having no cars except for axis and busses. By Bogota doing this the parks and sports centers have seen and highly approved of this idea and have turned uneven, fizzed sidewalks into broad, smooth sidewalks. Along with the new improvements, new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have appeared.

In conclusion, getting rid of cars perkily or even just for a day or a week seems like a good idea. Loss of the people mentioned above highly approve of this and say ZAZ IZ actually makes them a LOZ happier and stress free. Of course the people who don'tz approve of this idea are the ones who were fined for driving on a no-drive zone. All in all i still recommend this idea if things in Florida star ZO get out of hand and we must resort ZO something.",0
1906,"The future is near and the talk about driverless cars is upon us. Driverless cars give us the opportunity to save thousands of dollars in buying cars and paying for repairs. This also would be a lot more flexible than a bus because, the driverless cars could take us to our exact destination. Plus the driverless car idea would use half of the amount of fuel we use today.

The struggle we face on saving up to buy a car would not be a problem to us anymore. Multiple teens who already stress because of school have to also handle a job on top of that just to buy a car. Some even have to give up activities they love because of their jobs. Adults spend thousands of dollars just to buy cars and then have the risk of having to spend even more money when they break down to repair them. Wars are expensive items and the money we spend on them could go to other things like vacations, bills, and food.

Buses today have a certain route they follow on a daily basis. They are only capable of taking you to the closest bus stop to your desired location, this could still be a mile walk away from your destination. With driverless cars it would serve to you more as a taxi that takes you where you want to go. This saves us a lot of time because if you are late for the bus and have to wait on the next one, or you still have a long walk even after you are dropped off.

The solution fuel causes would decrease by 50%. The driverless cars are projected to use only half the amount of fuel cars and buses are using today. These makes earth a lot healthier and safer to live on for you and your family.

Driverless cars are a great change for the would. Makes your life a lot cheaper, safer, and saves you a lot of time. The talk of the future is here, and the driverless cars are near.",0

1908,"In my opinion, I thing driverless cars could simply change the world, I don't see many negative aspects of the idea of trying to made a car that a human doesn't need to drive.

I also thing that making a driverless car that needs human assistance as well is pointless because, the driver would sit there waiting for his turn to drive and that could get really boring for the driver sitting there cautiously waiting when it's his term.

It should be driverless completely or not at all.

In my opinion, the idea of driverless cars would be revolutionizing for humanity in many ways.

According to the text, they would Use the driverless cars as a taxi service, that would help in many ways when people need rides or want to get somewhere quick in a major city and not wait for a bus or train.

The biggest concern for the driverless car is the safety hazards and the laws that are set in place.

The text states that states lime, California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have limited Use of semiaUtonomoUs cars due to safety issues. A big concern is if you get into a car accident with a driverless car, who is there to blame?

In order for driverless cars to be Used they would have to set in liability law changes and who would be blamed for the accident, as it states in the text.

I am mutual for the feeling for driverless cars because there are the positives lime, driving the handicap, the taxi service that drives you where you need to go, tame a nap, etc. But the negatives are, driver safety for the passengers, will it be safe enough to driver on the street with other driverless cars, and will it be able to drive with this type of technology efficiently.

Based on the information I supplied, I thing the driverless car can be a major step in the world, but it can be a very dangerous one if not handled correctly.

According to the text, Tesla announced they would have a car that could drive itself 90 percent of the time by 2016, also Mercedes Benz and Nissan planned to have cars that can drive themselves completely by 2020.

The road to the truly autonomous car stretches ahead of Us it could lead to a bright future that revolutionizes the world, or it could lead to a very dangerous one, but we grow closer to the destination every day.",0
1909,"Imagine the sound of the school bell ringing, freedom, time to go home, it is a Friday after all, you get to go home and relax; but then you remember the new rule, all students must be signed up for an extracurricular activity. There goes another hour of my free time you mutter as you slowly walk towards your robotics club. Kids should not be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity. Most kids have other priorities whether it is limited time, or not wanting to be in a club, to even the stress of being forced into a social environment.

There is only one thing that is limited for every single person on the planet and that is time. Many kids feel that they don't have enough time already and if forced to Going a club that only meets once a week for an hour that Gust cuts an hour off their free time that they could be doing other things. Many kids participate in a sport that are very time-consuming. Most combative sports have multiple practices and games a week, along with practicing on your own. Another very time-consuming part of every child's life is family, spending time with grandparents or even Gust having fun with your parents or siblings. Your family is the most important thing in your life and any time you can spend with them should be spent with them, not at school in leadership council. Finally, your friends, every kid has a friend group and friends are a very important of every kids' life. Your friends are who you go to for advice and who you learn many life lessons from.

A huge part of middle school life is stress. It is impossible to never experience it about something. Homework is very stressful, having math, Spanish, science, English, and civics homework that is all due on one day is crazy, especially if you have less time than you usually would. Most kids have an hour and a half of homework each night with some nights being more. Imagine not getting home until 4:30 then having another hour and a half of homework, that means if you are focused, and you can get your work done you don't have any free time until 6:00. Pets are another thing that stress many kids out. Knowing that you have to hurry home to let your dog out is stressful, and it is made much worse when you have to wait another hour before you can leave school. Another reason that kids shouldn't be forced to participate in clubs is the amount of kids with social anxiety. Many kids freak out at hearing that they are going to have to go out into public once, much less every week. If kids want to be in clubs they can, but it isn't fair to make that a requirement.

To close, most kids who want to be in a club are in a club. Most of the kids who aren't in a club don't want to be and there is no reason to force those who would rather be at home with their family or having fun with their friends to be somewhere they don't want to be. Simply people have better things to do then be in a room with a ton of other people doing something that they aren't interested in. Clubs are great for kids that are interested in them and for kids who do want to be there, but when you add in a ton of students who would rather be elsewhere doing their own thing it Gusts makes everything worse. Also, there isn't enough space for everybody to be in their preferred club, so there would be angry kids and parents demanding that they signed up for a different club then the one they are in.

Kids shouldn't be required to be in an extracurricular activity if they don't want to be. Students have more important things to do with their time, they have many things causing them stress and most importantly they don't want to be in a club. There is no need to overcrowd clubs with grumpy kids that ruin everything for the kids who signed up to be there.",0

1911,"The idea of working at home for most children would be very much enumerating. No need to rush to catch a bus, miss a morning breakfast to attend school, or miss school because one slept late. You'd simply wake up slap some pajamas on and get to working on your computer.

Although you would be sacrificing the basic one to one classic learning situation where teacher and student are face to face, it is still attainable to teach away from home. In the eyes of a student currently attending Generic_School, like myself, working alone can sometimes be a struggle, two minds will always be greater than one. Two minds sometimes create bias, and at times bias is good. One would benefit from hearing the other side of the argument which may ultimately end one's single sided thinking. Also having the classroom aspect where you have multiple people who look at the same thing in different ways is important as well. Maybe the way student A looks at something is more compliant to your way of thinking rather than student d. Classmates help each other if the teacher can not, there are many instances in my learning here at Generic_School where I come to the terms of understanding a subject, but once one of my classmates broke it down for me in their way of thinking and seeing, a new light shown over the way I looked at things.

Schools may very well be a great thing, but they can also be damaging. We all know where there are friends, there are foes. When you group a bunch of developing teenagers going through puberty, where emotions and hormones are swarming around, you get a sort of cesspool of emotion. Yes, at times there will be drama, fights, gossip, harassment, and many other things normal to the life of every day teens. Some may say this is a lie, but it is very well the cold hard truth. People won't always get along it's a part of the human nature, and as you're growing up you are still trying to figure out what you do or don't get along with.

Even though there are negative things about attending school there are very many positive ones as well. One's social skills might develop more and more than time progresses, and they're surrounded by situations where they are prompted to socialize with other students. Also, a student might find his or her niche, where they belong, who they really are, what they do or don't like. I can't seem to put my finger on it, but there is a difference in learning where you sit behind a screen and listen to mind-numbing concepts all day, rather than sitting in an engaging classroom where you ask questions, work out problems, and get a more hands-on experience.

So when you ask me what my stance on working at home rather than at school. I would simply answer with, I don't know. The beauty of the human nature is to be able to adapt, adapt through hardships, adapt to new changes. Take chances in life, be prosperous, because at the end of the day, you only get one.",0
1912,"Do you think that the use technology is valuable for detecting emotional expressions? well I think that it is not valuable for us. I will be naming some reason why in this essay. If you are intrested in knowing more of why it wouldn't be valuable for us please read on.

A reason that I think that this type of technology wouldn't be valuable to us because I don't think it is important to try to understand how someone feels or what emotions they are having at that moment. They probably wouldn't want you to know because if they did they would probably tell you. It's none of our business honestly, however how we be for sure that this type of technology would even work. There is supposed to be 44 major facial muscles in our face and the computer is supposed construct that using a 3-D model but what happenes if it misses a muscle and the calculations are all wrong. Then you wouldn't exactly know what they are really feeling. The computer would not be giving you the excat emotion.

Also, There is a mucle called orbiculars oculi pars palpabraeus that makes crow's feet around your eyes, so if computers scans someone's face that has that then the computer would give out false information about the person is feeling just because of the face when this person could really happy. Another muscle that is created is called the risorius that could put on a false smile that make your mouth skretch sideways creating a smile that could make you look happy when your actually sad. The computer could also scan a person like that and would again give false information. I believe that the computer can be wrong because everything won't be correct as they should be.

Another way, is that a person could just not smile at all like how Mona Lisa was once before and they could be extremly happy, but if a computer were to scan how that the computer would give results of sadness but that is not actually how the person is feeling. Computers just can't calculate how a person is feeling 100 percent of the time and be correct about it. Yes, a computer can communicate with humans but not emotionally. This is a new type technology can have it's ups and downs but I think that it will have more downs than ups.

However, another mucsle called frontalis pars lateralis could make you seem suprised just by raising an eyebrow but that doesn't always mean your confused or shocked it could mean many other things. The computer can calculate that your confused just by raising your eyebrow because it could calculate your face expressin not emotion. Facial expressions are universal and could all mean different things and a computer wouldn't clearly be able to tell how someone is feeling. Dr. Huang observed the artist da vinci for human anatomy to help paint mucsles precisely but his software only have similar anatomical information as electronic code, so his software doesn't the exact electronic codes it need so it could be wrong about how people are feeling.

To hence, I don't think that technology to read emotions are valuble because the computer could be wrong and not give the exact emotion, it could falsly give how someone is feeling due to a muscle in a persons face to make them look a certain way, and that the computer could not create the exact face because it mioght miss a muscle and give the wrong expression.",0
1913,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

It has been brought upon my attention the issue concerning community service and wheatear or not it should be required at our school. I strongly urge you to enforce community service at our school because it teaches our students how to manage their time and provides them with an opportunity to receive experience in their future carer.

Here at SCHOOL_NAME students have a difficult time trying to manage their time in a healthy manner. They are continuously late for classes and don't seem to find enough time for home learning. Community service would absolutely benefit our students in needed areas such as those listed. OTHER_NAME, for example, is always late for his core classes and manages a 69% average in every class. He has also been predicted not proficient in class. To assist him in becoming an excellent student his guidance concealer suggest community service in teaching the youth. After realizing he could help other people manage their time wisely he also got into the habit of proceeding the same way in school. Community service can make a difference in an everyday students life therefore it must be required at our school.

Experience in your future career is absolutely a wonderful way to benefit our students in choosing a career for the future. Community service can provide time for students to get a feel on a certain subject in which they are interested in. For example, I always had an interest in working with children. Volunteering at my local church has been a wonderful experience and i also have been educated in ways i wouldn't be able to learn on my own. i feel as if I'm completely prepared to take an internship any given day. Community service is beneficial in everyway and has many different opportunities for our students to consider.

Our students our the future and it's best we give them every opportunity available such as community service.

Your student,

1914,"There are always people maying that alien mare alive and maybe that there I'm going to be an alien invasion. In 1976, a Mary Global surveyor (MGS) found an image of a Peron or am MGS may a ""a Viking photo."" I believe the image of the Viking I'm just a landform and it warn't created by alien. I will explain to you why I think it'm a landform.

Furthermore, I believe the image I'm a just a landform became scientist haven't discovered life yet on Mary even though they have found water on Mary. In paragraph 2, the author state, ""Scientist figured it WAM just another Martian memo, common enough around Lydia, only this one had unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" I agree with this statement became if the Martian memo WAM made again, that mean that they will be around for a long time, and it will never disappear. The author also state that people think the image or the Face I'm bona fide evidence of life on Mary. By the look of the image, I could meet hat every year they have taken it, I can meet hat it'm disappearing. In the introduction, it may, ""New highremolution image and 3D altimetry from NASA'm Mary Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mary for what it really im: A memo."" If people want evidence of alien or other creature, they will have to do research on their pair time became scientist have a job to do, and they will only do what they are ordered to do. Just to be clear, when they took the photo of the Face on 1976,1998, and 2001, the technology warn't am advanced am it I'm today but, if we take a photo of it today, I believe there will probably be another one of the landform, or probably we might me the Face but just slowly disappearing. Theme were more of my reason to argue with to support my belief of the Face being a natural landform.

In conclusion, the image of the Face WAM just a myth and I will never may it WAM created by alien. Alien maren't even real, that Han't been confirmed or maid. Not one scientist ham maid that they have been a living creature on any planet walking or doing anything. Theme were just rumors, and it can be maid am a myth if people want. Based on theme reason, I believe the Face I'm just a natural landform on Mary.  ",0
1915,"Dear Principal,

I understand that you wait us to do community service, but some people just dog't have time to do things like that. Like, say that you say we have to do it OG a Saturday at 9:00am to 12:00pm got everybody CAG make that time. Also got everybody wait to do it. I think that you should do it at a different school because you are trying to force us to do community service AGD we dog't wait to do it. Why dog't you get out of that desk AGD you do it too.

Sorry, got to be mean, but I really wait to do it, but I dog't have time for it. I'm IG the 8th grade AGD I get a lot of homework to do. AGD I have to keep up with my grades. AGD I have to focus OG the CMT test that is coming up. I think that it should be optional weather we do community service.

1916,"Have you ever had to do a project during the summer break? In some schools, they may require that you do a few projects in order to maintain what you have earned, usually being designed by the teachers, which may not work with most students. Instead, the students should design the projects as they know more what works for them educationally, and they know how to adjust the project to their schedule.

Oftentimes, not AGG students green content in the same ways; some students may be visual learners whereas others are more lecture based learners. This also extends to projects, where certain student excel better at certain categories, such as a music student being more effective at making music for a video project. Oftentimes in projects when a student can't effectively do a project, they get a power grade, which powers their average Grade Point Average alongside other things simply because they do not work egg with the specific subject of the project. Because of this fact, students should design their projects as they know how they work as egg as how the green. Not only does a student designed project aglow for the student to be more effective at competing it, it gives the students a greater interest in the topic, growing both increased creative drive as egg as increased motivation to complete the project.

When it comes to projects and deadlines, schools oftentimes OGG out standards and assessments that don't take into account how the individual student would be age to effectively abide my them. In many cases there are students who are unable to complete assignments and attend events because of complications in their life that they can't control, such as, but not limited to: Needing to work to support their family, needing to care for a family member, having to travel to another country or place because of their family, and many more. In cases such as that, the projects and assignments set by the school, which are often based on the assumption that students do not possess any tasks beyond school, are simply hard if not impossible to complete for those students. If the students would be age to make their projects, then they can design them to fit alongside their life, making it so that they are more capable of accomplishing them. Alongside making it better for the students, it could HEGP increase the high school graduation rate as many students drop out of high school because they are unable to complete their education.

In discussions of this topic, some may say that the students don't know what they need to do for the projects, so they can't make them. This argument, however, is invalid for quite a few reasons. Firstly, the students know what the course that they took in the passing school year contained. As they know what the year contained, they can make their projects cover those topics. Secondly, the students don't need to design the project soggy by themselves. The teachers of the respective course could be of assistance by providing a checklist of sorts to assist the students in making the project. Thirdly, the teachers who design projects often make them in a sweeping manner, which as been explained earlier doesn't work with AGG students.

In conclusion, summer projects that schools require should be made by students for a couple of reasons. These include the fact that students can adjust the project to fit their learning alongside that they can adjust it to better aging with their life. For those reasons, schools should aglow students to make their own summer projects.",0

1918,"Homeschooling has become increasingly more common over the last few decades. Whether it is through taking courses online or sitting down with a teacher at home, many students have found success in this type of learning environment. All schools should consider implementing distance learning because it caters to the individual needs of students, allows for self paced learning, and provides more time for students to complete extracurricular activities.

Nowadays, many people are realizing that the traditional public school environment does not work for everyone. Over time, more kids are developing social anxieties and fears that make it hard to attend school. Ultimately, these challenges interfere with learning. Students who suffer with social anxiety would be more comfortable learning in the security of their own home. They will be given the opportunity to learn in a calming environment, which will likely increase their grades and overall understanding of material. In addition, there are many students with learning disabilities who would also benefit from learning from home. Some students need extra help that they are not provided with in school. Even if all it takes to help students be more successful is a quick break every so often, distance learning provides that, unlike public school.

Another positive benefit of distance learning is that it allows for courses to be more self paced. Often times at school, students find themselves doing work Rust to pass the time. When learning from their own home, students are able to get their work done fluently without wasting time. Likewise, the students who need additional time to review are given that opportunity as well. Sometimes in public school, teachers go too fast and leave students feeling confused and stressed. When learning from home, students are able to spend as much or as little time on concepts as necessary. This will help make sure all students are fully grasping the concepts taught in school.

Lastly, most students are involved in extracurricular activities. Kids participate in everything from sports to volunteering around the community. Many high school students even have Robs to help support their families or to save up for college. Most public schools last around seven hours each day. Then after school, students come home and complete their homework. With school taking up most of a students' day, they don't have much time for extracurricular activities or hobbies. With distance learning, students will have a more flexible schedule. Many homeschooling opportunities allow for kids to complete their courses whenever they have time. This allows for students to spend more time doing things outside of school that make them happy. Some people may argue that public school is important because it is the place where students develop their social skills, however if students were provided with time for other activities, then public school would not be the only environment for social skills to develop.

Over the years, distance learning has, and will continue to, become significantly more common. Although it is not for everyone, all schools should offer it because different people thrive in different types of environments. Distance learning allows for students to spend the necessary amount of time on their courses and no more. As a result, students will have more time to send with loved ones or participating in sports and hobbies. Ultimately, students all over the world can benefit from distance learning.  ",0

1920,"The technology use to read emotional expressions of students can be valuable. The reasons why I think this is because if you can calculate emotions you can see from AXX the emotions like, happiness, surprise, anger, digest, fear and sadness. AXX of these have their own facial muscles. Like when your surprised your eyebrows rise which is your front axis par reiterates muscle. Another reason why this might be valuable is people who have emotion problems. It can help doctors determine weather it's a muscle that isn't working property or some kind of nerve. It can be helpful to people who are depressed some people may have trouble showing their emotions. They can show a web ad and if you smile, a similar ad high follow. Which that is very true. Some people aren't interested in things as others are. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. This is also an amazing thing for the professors out there and teachers. Some students are shy and won't go up or raise there hand for help. I was like this AXX the way up to my sophomore year of highschoox and that isn't very good. That's why some students are struggling at this very moment.

Putting smile on your face Wix help you away be happy and keep one on your face. It is crazy how much you can learn by just reading something with so much science you never would have known. This computer device Wix help to determine what makes a person feet the way they feet which is a brilliant idea. Because not only is it useful for entertainment but also for serious problems or issues. I agree that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable.",0
1921,"I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Participating in an extracurricular activity could help students build their teamwork skills. Depending on which extracurricular activity students participate in, it could help strengthen some of their teamwork skills and their ability to work with others. It could also help some shy students become more social and help them want to work with others and participate in different activities. Say someone who really didn't like working with other people, and only liked to do things by himself, joined the soccer team. When they would play practice games he would never pass to anyone, he kept the ball to himself, even when a few of his teammates were wide open, he never passed to them because he wanted to make the goal himself. However, every time he tried to make a goal alone, he always failed, and soon he learned that he would never make a goal by keeping the ball all to himself. He learned that in order to win, he must pass the ball and work with his teammates, passing the ball back and forth. He learned that the only way to win was through teamwork, had he not joined the soccer team, it would have taken him a while to learn that sometimes it's best to work with people, and joining that soccer team helped him build up his teamwork skills. Having students participate in an extracurricular activity will help strengthen their teamwork skill and help some people figure out what they like, what they don't like, and lean how to be more comfortable around people.

Students can figure out what they're into, what they like to do and what they don't like to do. When students participate in different activities they figure out that they might like soccer and pottery, but hate drawing and writing. They get to figure out what they enjoy and what they don't enjoy, and some may like doing something so much that they might what to do it as a job later in life when they're older. In 5th grade I joined orchestra because I wanted to try something new. I chose to play the cello because I had heard people playing their cello's a while ago, but I remembered how beautiful it sounded. Also, because I had seen a movie then about this girl who played the cello, and she played beautiful pieces and wanted to play the cello as her career. It was an amazing movie and after watching it I could not get it out of my head. So that's when I decided I wanted to play the cello. The first year playing the cello was pretty difficult because I did not know how to read the music and my teacher at my telemetry school was not really teaching me how to read the notes, but I was not really trying to either so that made it pretty difficult. The second year was a little better but still pretty bad because I still had not learned how to properly read the music. I had the same music teacher as last year, and she still did not teach me how to read the notes or what they were called, but then again, just like last year, I was not really trying either. I would recognize some notes but still had no idea what they were called. So in those two years I basically learned how to play the cello, but not how to read what I played. Xoming into middle school, I did not think I would continue to play the cello, considering my experience from the 2 years before, but I did choose to continue playing the cello going into middle school. That's where I met my new orchestra teachers, and they taught me how to read the music. It took sometime but now I can read music sheets perfectly fine, and I continued to play the cello into 8th grade as well. I tried something new, and the first 2 years were not the best, but towards the end, I ended loving to play the cello, even if I'm not the best at it. Growing up kids find out what they enjoy and what they dislike, and that shapes how they see things and their personality. Including figuring what they want to do in the future, by figuring out what they enjoy doing, and avoiding the things they don't enjoy doing or being a part of, while having fun.

Students can have fun while participating in extracurricular activities and enjoy themselves. Students can have fun with their friends while participating in different activities and might get to do cool projects and experiments, depending on what activity they participate in. Whichever one student decide to participate in, they'll have fun with the people who are in that activity as well while still participating and doing what they're told by the teacher in charge of that activity. In orchestra, we play a lot of different music for different concerts and also just as warm-ups. Almost everyone has a stand partner, unless someone has their own stand. You might need to talk to your stand partner, and sometimes you become friends with them. Though it does not seem like it, you can make a lot of friends in orchestra, even if you play a different instrument or sit across the room from each other. There are times when we have to be serious, like preparing for a concert or during a concert, but before we can talk to each other, practice together, or just talk sometimes. One time before a concert, my best friends sat next to me, and we started playing pieces together, even thought we don't play the same instrument. We have fun with our friends, and we enjoy playing together, even if we mess up a lot, it is still fun. Students get to enjoy themselves and have fun while still doing the work that they must do for that activity and get to figure out what they like doing and what they dislike, also while being with their friends.

All students should participate in extracurricular activities because participating them can help students in so many ways. They can teach students what they like and what they dislike and learn different things depending on which activity you're a part of. Students also get to have fun and spend time with their friends while also working and participating with the activity.",0

Uhe other students who get B averages think that students who get C averages are not as smart as they are. Uhe students who have C averages also think that they cannot get anything higher than a C. the students who get B averages tell the students who get a C average that they cannot get any higher than a C as well. So I think that students who get a C average should still be able to partake in after school stuff. So I think that the students who have a C average can try harder and get a B.,0

Car Free Cities-

Cities in Europe and parts of the United States have taken a new trend, car free cities, this may be weird, but the amount of good that comes from not having cars is incredible. Cars cause a greenhouse gases which are awful for the environment.

Limiting car usage has many advantages and can help everyone.

A place known as Vauban, located in Germany has over 5,500 residents and only 30 percent of them own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move there. People said that they lived much better lives without a car in (source 1), smog and toxic car feuds don't clog the city air allowing it to be free for people to walk outside and smell the fresh air. Some cities even enforce not to drive, such as Paris if you drive through certre areas you will be fined 22-euros ($31). Enough smog clear after people saw they were getting fined. There are some areas of the United States where greenhouse gas emissions are 50 percent, not only does this cause health related problems but also it effects the environment, to help this the ""Environmental Protection Agency is promoting""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act."" This means that bills will be past to have certain areas have cars reduced.

This incredible idea really helps everyone and will help the future, some say it's the end of the car culture. Different bills are being passed to help communities reduce emission of the gases that come from cars that effect the environment and certain health problems. Such as New York, they started a new bike-sharing program. Some people within the ages of 16-21 have started new priority and have organized themself to not need the use of a car. This is a prolong goal to help the environment and people, to create a better future. ""The executive chairman of Ford Motor Company. Has laid out a business plan for a world in which vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable.""(source4) Even car companies see the cars are bad and want change for a brighter future.

Limiting car usage or even no cars at all only have pros and is a very good idea for people who like to plan a good future and live in the suburbs. Cars are bad for the environment and should be reduced to help out.",0

On Monday motorists are told to leave there car at home or there is a 31 dollar fine. Almost 4,000 drivers their fined one day.27 people had there car impounded because of the reaction to the fine. Cars have been banned for 3 years. Only buses and taxis are permitted for the day. There goal is to promote alternative transport. Violators faced a 25 dollar fine.

Parks and sports centers have bloomed since they haves cut traffic. Presdient Obama has ambitious goals to curb America. Studdies show that fear Americans are buying cars and getting less licenses as the years go by.

1925,"Over time, traditional schooling has evolved drastically. The standard one room school houses that were once prevalent in the 1900s, have now turned into massive buildings, often having more than one floor and schooling up to 1,000 students a year. Due to the many ways' education has evolved, it is important to be able to accommodate the needs of various students. With new advancements in technology, many options are now available for students who are unable to attend school due to their circumstances. Programs such as Google Classroom and Vision make online learning easier and accessible for both students and teachers. All schools should offer some form of distance learning because of the benefits of ease of access, self-paced learning, and learning how to become independent.

Famous teenagers are known to benefit significantly from distance learning. Many of these teenagers are often traveling to different countries and various events, so traditional school timings are not acquirable. Due to the introduction of using technology to learn from home, famous teenagers as well as other students no all have access to an education no matter where they are. The same goes for students who live in completely rural farming towns with schools that require most a 30-minute commute. Depending on where a person might live, the school closest to them can be as far as 10 miles away or more. These students are able to benefit from taking classes at home because they are more easily accessible, in turn enticing the students to attend online conferences and finish school. The major benefits of this would be the students having access to learn from the comfort of their homes despite any hardships that deter them from attending school.

Learning from home also allows a student to learn at their own pace. In traditional school setting there's a 90-minute interval of learning subject and then switching classes to learn subject. This limits a student from being able to spend time in class to learn material. Having classes that a student could attend form home would allow the students to keep their classes self-paced. Say that a student is feeling bombarded with work after having 4 classes within 8 hours a day in a traditional school setting. Offering classes through distance learning would allow the student to decide when to take which class as well as how much time to spend on the subject. Without allotted times and restrictions just like traditional school offers, the amount of time spent on learning material will help the students encode the information and retain it more easily and effectively. Attending classes at home also allows the student to adjust their schedules accordingly. Whereas most high schoolers go to school from 9:15am -4:03pm, and then arrive to their jobs at 5 pm, working late into the evening, having classes at home can eliminate having less time do homework, sleep, and extracurricular. A student who is taking classes at home might prefer to go to work early in the morning and start their classes around 3 pm and spend more time on a certain subject. Allowing students to attend classes from home gives them the ability to chose their own work paces as well as accommodate to their own learning styles.

Students learning from classes online and at their own paces would be benefit greatly by learning how to become independent and self efficient. The traditional school setting motivates you to get assignments turned in due to deadlines and learn due to emphasis from teachers and their peers. Taking classes from home can either cause a student to become extremely disorganized and lazy, or learn how to effectively rely on themselves to manage time wisely and get tasks done like mature young adult. Allowing for students to take part in learning from home through online classes will keep them in charge and accountable for their education. It will also work to prepare them for the next phase in life, college. Since more academic freedom is given in college, learning how to balance time wisely through taking classes at home, will help better prepare students for the future. Distance learning will prompt students to come up with schedules catered to their needs and wants in order to work towards earning good grades and accomplishing tasks.

There are numerous benefits to introducing distance learning for students in traditional schools. Being able to take classes at home will allow many schools to accommodate to the various needs of their students. Many students will be able to enhance their learning through working on course material at home and becoming more independent in their lives. Students will also be able to take classes wherever and whenever needed, encouraging all students to finish school. Thanks to the advancements in technology and teaching methods, having classes accessible at home on and off campus allow for students to easily participate in school, learn how to take control of their learning, and prepare for the future. ",0
1926,"You really think that the Face was created by aliens? Well I do not think that. First OD all there is no evidence that aliens even exist. Second OD all, there is no evidence that it was created by aliens at all, it is just a conspiracy theory. Also, another example would be that it says in the paragraph that is just a land dorm. I believe that the Face is just a land dorm, like the ones on earth.

My first example that the Face wasn't created my aliens would be, there is no evidence that aliens even existed ever. There is no evidence in the passage, but it is just a known belied that aliens have never existed at all, in the history OD ever.

Another example that I believe would be that, yet again there is no evidence that the aliens (that don't exist) even made that. For instance, in paragraph six it states,"" Although dew scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact....."" We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" This example shows that even dew scientist believe that the aliens created it. NASA still tried to prove that it wasn't made by the aliens that don't exist.

My last reason I believe that the Face wasn't made by aliens would be that, the Face was proven to be just like the land dorms on Earth, and we didn't shape those. For example, in paragraph twelve it states,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent OD a butte or mesa land dorms common around the American West. ""It reminds me most OD Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain OD Idaho,""

says Gavin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the dorm OD an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

This example shows that it was proven that the Face is just like land dorms on Earth.

In conclusion, these three examples show why I believe that the Face was not made by aliens. It is just a land dorm, like the ones on Earth. There is no evidence that aliens even exist. There is no evidence that aliens created the Face. Also, it was proven that the Face is just like land dorms on Earth. I believe that the Face is just a natural land dorm. ",0
1927,"One of the most truly modern American experiences has got to be voicing one's opinion on a subject they have little to know knowledge or experience with to the world. Unfortunately, today my opinion will not be voiced to the world as this is a SOL test, but it will be a scarcely informed opinion for sure. I have the privilege of never being assigned a project by a school over the summer, but today's prompt has drawn something to my attention that I never quite thought about before That these summer projects assigned by schools should absolutely be designed by the students who have to do them as they can then be tailored to fit the students interests and schedules, within reason of course.

Starting off positive, the most obvious pro of student designed summer projects is the creative liberty. Students would not only be free to pick whatever topic or subject they like, but the form their project takes. A student could go the conventional route and do a presentation with a trifold or something similar, or go in the opposite direction and hold a workshop explaining why purple light doesn't technically exist, complete with interactive features. They may even incorporate their other summer activities into their project, as a student traveling to France for the summer might research a part of French history and include their own photos that they took that relate to the topic. Speaking of other summer activities, students with jobs, internships, or anything else that may take up multiple hours of the day could then ensure that the project they give themselves is something that they can handle.

Now that I've explained all the wonderful pros of student designed projects, let's reign it back in a bit and discuss the cons and some solutions to those cons along with my mildly valid expertise. I've been a girl scout since I was in elementary school and for the past few summers been doing research for a gold award project, the highest honor that a girl scout can earn. The main focus of a gold award is of course the project, which is designed entirely by the scout, may take anywhere from a couple of months to a year, and a proposal of said project has to be approved by a council.

Granted, this is on a bit of a larger scale compared to a school summer project, but there are some good ideas that could be drawn from this. Approval of the project idea could ensure that the projects have genuine learning value, and could be approved by the student's counselor. Lonselors would then also see to that students give themselves proper workloads, ensuring that they don't overwork themselves, or take the easy route either. Putting a deadline on the approval might also help encourage students to at least think about their project a bit before the night it's due. Gold awards also look good on college applications, and allowing students to make their projects something that they would be so proud of to put on a college application could be a boost in motivation for those college bound.

The concept of allowing students to have this much control over a project as we move towards an education system where the students are being allowed more control and freedom day by day can be truly great when done correctly. Which can absolutely happen, when necessary restraints are given. It simply requires more work on everyone's part, and considering that educational institutions are supposed to be preparing entire generations for life itself, and not just a workplace or university, that shouldn't be too hard? Perhaps I put too much faith in this, but I truly do hope to see the day when students are proactive enough to go about these sorts of things on their own, not for a grade or award, but to better themselves and the world around them.",0
1928,"As a student, if I don't understand something in class, I will ask someone about it. Whether that is a teacher, a student, or a parent there is almost always someone who knows. If any one of these reliable sources does not know, I can most likely look it up on one of my devices that has the internet. If we were to introduce the new FACS technology, it may have unintended lasting impacts which could be detrimental to our society.

It was mentioned in the passage on paragraph 6 that"" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' ""

The first reason that it could be bad for our society as a whole is that it is not the computer's duty to explain how to do everything and to change to our will. While computers were made to help us, it cannot be our only source of information. On the other hand, teachers are st school for the sole purpose of helping you learn. It is their actual job to be there to help you learn things. While computers are a tool to help achieve this goal, there are other ways to learn about things and get them explained to you.

When you are in high school, many teachers and parents will say things to you along the lines of ""In the real world"" and"" High school is preparing you for the real world"". Later on in life, ""in the real world"", if you get bored at a job you cannot just change what you are doing. You have to continue on with it because it is your job. If we implemented this system now in schools, many kids and teens would get in their mindset that if they are bored or don't understand something, things will change for them. Kids should not rely on a computer to help them understand everything. There are teachers, classmates, parents, and other adults who can help.

The second reason why this could be bad for our society is the accessibility. Not every school has computers and not every class uses them. If we were to implement this software, it could be giving an unfair advantage to the students who had access to it. There are still plenty of schools that may not have a computer in every classroom. Similarly, not all students and parents can afford this kind of technology. Because of how new and high tech this software is it most likely will cost more money to be put into effect. This would cause the schools with more money to be able to get it while the schools with less funding and less money to be pushed aside and not get it. This causes the students at the schools that cannot afford it to have a disadvantage.

The third and final reason why this could be bad for our society as a whole is simply that people may become less sensitive to reading other peoples emotions. Without needing to have face to face human interactions to see how people are feeling, it could result in a decline of being able to recognize emotions in facial expressions.

I learned a few chords on the ukulele this summer. I could piece together a song or two. Now after a few months, I can't remember the first thing about playing those chords. This example shows that if you learn something then don't do it for an extended period of time, it will take a while to relearn how to do it. Although reading emotions is nothing like playing ukulele, the same holds true; if you learn something, and rely on something else to help you do it, it is going to be hard for you to relearn how to do it again.

People also have a right to privacy and some people may not enjoy those particular rights being breached. I am a person who does not let all of my emotions show. Other people may bottle these feelings up in hopes that nobody will see. If people want to keep in how they feel, they should be able to do that as it is what they want.

Because it is not the computers' duty to explain everything to you, not everyone has access to this kind of software, and people may lose their sensitivity to the fine art of emotion reading, I am in opposition of implementing this FACS technology.",0
1929,"I disagree in having to make students participate in a sport, or extracurricular activity. Not all students enjoy playing sports or participating in a school activity. Not many parents have the time or money to put their kids in such either, and its also putting more stress on kids during and after school if having to join one.

When being forced to do something such as a sport or school activity the school has to find a variety of the kids liking. Making sure all the kids in his school have a place to have fun at and not just something they have to do and don't enjoy. Having all kids in something at a school can cause running into dept because that's a lot of kids you have to put money towards. Sports can run as much as two to a hundred dollars per kid for any sport, and when having to be forced into a sport that you don't enjoy why waist money. Even when the kids don't want to participate why even try putting your hardworking money towards it.

Sports and activities for school are not free. The school has to buy equipment and tools for those opportunities and, sometimes not all parents can physically do that. Sports are a lot of money and when having to be put into one not knowing how you are going to pay for it can be embarrassing. Letting your kid down is the least a father or mother would ever want to do, and when working in the school board having to deal with phone calls from parents saying they can't afford an extracurricular activity would be heartbreaking.

Kids work really hard to put forth effort on school work, homework, and participate in school projects. That can be already enough stress on a kid no matter what age. When having to put another thing on top of school work managing time for sports, and extra activities sometimes kids just can't deal with it. Grades and having a good GPA can come first for some kids. Sports and other things come last. You could probably already have something after school you do and having to move your whole schedule around can be really tiring and stressful.

This is why I disagree on having to make kids participate in a sport or activity. Its way too much work, stress, and money. So when coming down to a decision I agree with a no because having every kid in a sport or activity is absurd. ",0
1930,"Limiting car usage will give us many benefits. A project such as Vauban and Bogotá were completed to slow us TLE multitude of advantages received from it.

Reducing car usage would be excellent for our environment. Research slows us that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in TLE United States""(Rosenthal). Our world is very materialistic, and sometimes we forget that to even Lave life, we must Lave TLE environment. ""Cars owned by TLE burgeoning middle class are closing cities""(Rosenthal). Therefore, limiting TLE amount of cars would allow us to Lave more efficient green Louses, and more land area for plants.

Money is also a Luge factor Lair. TLE government spends Hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in TLE transportation department. By lowering TLE number of cars on TLE road, TLE less wear and tear is done to them. This would be beneficial in many departments because then we would Lave more money for TLE things we need but cannot afford in our area and or country. In fact, ""80 percent of appropriations Lave by law gone to Highways and only 20 percent to other transportation""(Rosenthal).

Driving also causes stress. Traffic jams, new or confusing road signs, attitudes of passengers, are all distributions of stress, especially when you get lost! If TLE amount of driving we did by ourselves was cut back, we could also cut back stress. Bogotá Helps to prove this, and even says that violates of no car day were ""fined $25(Silky).

Lastly, if we do not put a stop to so much driving, our personal Health may be in risk. According to source 4, ""TLE car industry is TLE second largest in TLE world."" This means that TLE air is constantly being polluted with exhaust. Which also means that what's in your lungs at this very moment, could be a lot more than just oxygen. It's very scary to link that TLE same chemicals it takes to run your car, might just be what's floating around in your body. This could lead to multiple Health problems and future diseases. Therefore, this issue needs to be taken control of immediately.

In conclusion, reducing car usage would be an amazing thing to do for ourselves and TLE people around us. We would save our air and bodies from being polluted, we would save money, and save time not stressing out. Who doesn't want these things? Limiting car usage would be a fantastic idea.",0
1931,"The Earth and Venus have somewhat in common which is allowing NASA want to do what they are trying to study for. Venus is the closest planet to the sun. Which will bring some problems to the project. But it won't stop NASA from trying to do what they are soon going to accomplish.

There is a possibility that Venus will have some living things. And to find out about all this it takes risk. And that's what NASA is trying to do but carefully and slowly.

To conclude the actor did a good job explaining his going and also supporting his idea. Sooner or later NASA or someone else will go to Venus. And the truth will be told.",0
1932,"Will Vehicles be gone in the near future? Many movements hare started due to cars polluting the air and melting the polar ice caps. For one, a community has been built where cars are not allowed, and a carefree movement started in Bogota, Columbia three years ago that banned Vehicles other than bases and taxes. Also, due to diesel cars polluting the air that made Paris be on par with China's pollution, they ended XP banning cars for some time.

""Since World War II, all of or development has been centered on the car,"" said David Goldberg, an official of transportation for America. The Environmental Protection Agency of the United States is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. Many hope that public transport serving suburbs play a much larger role in a new six year federal transportation bill to be approved this year. 80 percent of appropriations hare by law only gone to highways and 20 percent to other transport. Vauban, which was completed in 2006, is one example that separates suburban life from auto Use. As a result of 40,000 dollars being needed to by a space for a car along with a home, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars. Vauban, with a population of over 5,000 residents, might be the most advanced low car suburban life experiment.

Bogotá, Columbia has started with a carefree day which is spinning into a big hit. Millions of Colombians either hiked, biked, skated or took bases to get to their destinations during the carefree day. For three straight years, in the capital city of Bogota, 7 million people were able to get to their destinations without the Use of cars. As said by one of the residents of Bogotá, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and air pollution"". 118 miles of bicycle paths hare been made due to the improvement campaign that was created in the mid1990s. Many parks and sports centers hare also bloomed throughout the city due to the campaign and ban on Vehicles.

Due to all the congestion and pollution, Paris ended XP issuing a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution. In the following days, motorists with either even or odd numbered plates were either forced to leave their cars at home or pay a fine of 31 dollars. Due to the fact that France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline, they were blamed for the pollution in the air. 67 percent of Vehicles in France are diesel Vehicles. After 5 days congestion was down about 60 percent which rivaled the pollution was in Beijing, China which is known as one of the most hugely polluted cities in the world. Due to Paris putting a temporary ban on cars, they had complains about companies losing revenge. When the pollution in the air started to clear XP enough, the ban on cars was lifted.

In conclusion, cars might end XP being banned in multiple places around the globe to help with pollution. According to experts, it is said that there has recently been a large drop in the Usage of cars, and it will continue to drop. Demographic shifts suggests that there has been a large decline in the percentage of 16 to 39-year-olds getting licenses to DRIRE Vehicles. A study last year has also showed that driving by young people has declined 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Many study hare showed that the decline in people getting licenses and driving will continue to reduce rapidly.  ",0
1933,"I believe school summer projects should be studentdesiwned. Studentdesiwned projects will help a student express their creativity, it will be less complicated, and it will let them learn about a topic they are interested in. If the project is studentdesiwned, it is most likely for them to keep up with it and not set it aside. Students should be trusted to build something on what they learned on their own.

Even though not all students come up with astonishing ideas, all of them have the capacity to be creative. Creativity is important when it comes to projects. It helps a project look presentable, it also helps the audience wain interest. Students can let their imagination discover more ideas when a project is not teacherdesiwned because their options are not limited. Not only will it be more exciting to do a project, but it will increase students' trade by showing their creativity.

A studentdesiwned project will relieve stress from students by band able to create whatever they please. Instead of having to assemble something difficult given by a teacher, a student will choose an easier option for themselves, so they will not build up pressure. Since they will most likely pick a non-difficult idea, they can complete their project faster. Therefore, students will enjoy their summer break more.

Furthermore, most students will choose an option they are intrigued in, which makes a project become more interesting. Students will pick one out of a variety that they enjoy; they will stay on task. For example, the more engaged the students are to their project the more it will help them stay focused. When they pick a topic they like, the project becomes more simple to make because it is genuine or sincere.

Given all these points, summer projects should be designed by students. It will make it easier for the students to work on and more interesting for the teacher to read. All the students' creativity and engagement in the project can lead to positive outcomes. Students should enjoy their summer break while creating an incredible project they love. Teachers should not doubt students when they design their own projects.  ",0
1934,"A good attitude is one of the most important things in life, because when you're talking or do something with the best attitude you can see how everything is going great, and people feels good and comfortable with you. In the same time, it can open a lot of doors for you, and it can be a good opportunity for being a successful.

On the other hand, people believe that have a good attitude all the time is not a good idea, because some people will make use you, but most of the people who think like that don't have a success life; most of that people in the future feel depressing, feels like they don't do anything with you life, they are not successful, and is something that every person needs thing about, you need to prove that you can do it, that you can be a professional, and that you are more than people thing of you, because you need to show people that is nothing impossible in life, that all your goals and dreams can make real.

Nor example, a person work in a restaurant, and you have a good attitude with the customers, you make them feel like in home, not waiting too long for their drinks and food, you will show them that you are really happy for having them in there; in the other side, a person who works in the restaurant, don't smile to the customer, make they feel uncomfortable, and don't care about their drinks and food they don't go back to the restaurant or don't choice you for being their waitress, because you don't have a good attitude with your customers.

Also, make yourself a successful person, a person who the people want to talk, a person who a company want to you for work there, a person who do all the goals and dreams, and a person who love himself, because you got love yourself, respect yourself, and try your best every single day, that is really important in your life. The attitude make you go for the best or wrong way, the best give you the best opportunity for a successful person; however, the bad give you the work in where you do feel good, and where the best part of your day is when you go to the bathroom and use you phone for a couple of minutes, when you got to life for check to check, that is the life of people who think the attitude is no the key of success, everyone doesn't reserve that, they reserve be happy, and have a good life with the people they love.

Is the same way in school, talking about teacher and students, ""respect if you want respect back"", most of the students always have attitude with their teacher, they never respect them, but they want respect, a good attitude in school is the best thing we can do, because the teacher will help you more if they see you respect and really want to work, you are the person who need good grades, if you have a good attitude you will see the process in your life, in your classes, and your home. Also, in home, their parents need show and teach their kids that the attitude is the key of life, that they need to have a good attitude if they want to be a good person in the future, that they want to be a professional, and be better person every day, they will think on that, they will ask themselves why their parents try to teach them that the attitude is important, and they will bray to have a good attitude for be a successful person.

In conclusion, the attitude is the key that will open all the doors you want, that's no matter what problems you have, when you do something you need doing with the best of you attitude, all is going to be perfect when you got a good attitude with people and with yourself. Try and see how your life is going for a straight way. They will enjoy their life, be happy with themselves and with the people around them, is all about how you're acting, how you express yourself, and the way you're talking with people, every person need to make a different and show to everyone that the attitude is important to life, they will learn if the see that most of the people is doing it, try to make a different and see how everything is change for you. All is based on you.",0
1935,"In this modern era of easy access to technology, children are heavily influenced by the electronic world into which they immerse themselves. Thus, the younger generations are growing more familiar and comfortable with technology than their own parents and grandparents will ever be. In well endowed school districts, students often have Chromebooks, Macs, or another brand of a small, portable laptop. It becomes easier to teach students with online material when each and every child has his or her own school issued device, and other schools have gone as far as to implement distance learning, a form of education offered through the accessibility of technology. Oistancelearning, while heavily reliant on electricity and technology, is greatly beneficial to students because it would both allow those who are not able to attend school due to sickness and reach those who live far away from a learning institution.

Sickness spreads easily in a crowded, public environment where many tools, like pencils, scissor, and desks are shared. Students often cannot afford to miss school due to illness, so they will attend anyway, no matter the severity of their sickness. Even with the addition of laptops into education, missing a day of learning has the potential to impact student learning because he or she is not present for the teacher's lecture and explanation of material. Through distance learning, students who are sick would be able to connect with the class and teacher in real-time and be able to ask questions to further his or her understanding. If the student was in the hospital, having come down with a more serious illness, like pneumonia, he or she would likely miss out on a few concepts from class but later video chat with a teacher while simultaneously not missing out on medical attention.

Students who live far away from their school would also benefit from income learning. Those who live in more rural parts of a school district often have an early makeup call for a long commute riddled with morning rush hour traffic. Then, in school, the student is already mentally exhausted and must prepare for the long trek home. Oistance learning would eliminate the commute for faraway students, saving them money in gasoline and time in transit. They would also not need to wake up as early and go to bed as late, allowing for a healthier sleep schedule. Many students take part in before or after school activities, like a sport. Elite swimmers practice before the sun comes up each morning, hurry off to school for a few hours of learning, then head back to the pool for a second practice or weight routine. Balancing athletics, school, and sleep can prove difficult, especially during endofseason competitions that run during school days or weeks. But with distance learning, student athletes would be able to catch up on missed work while they were absent and have the opportunity to ask their teachers questions when they return.

However, distance learning is not a perfect solution; it sets up a heavy dependence on electricity and wireless connectivity. In times of inclement weather, like a thunderstorm, high winds, or heavy ice, power lines can be knocked out, disconnecting students reliant on their laptop to learn. While inclement weather always carries with it the chance of a school cancellation, some school districts are more prepared for such catastrophes. For example, Minnesota and New York are often slammed with horrendous snowstorms that bring several feet of snow, but these northern states come prepared, bringing their snowplows out in full force and working around the clock to ensure that the roads are safe. Students who live in areas of extreme temperatures and weather are prepared to brave the dangers of the outside. So, students learning from remote areas will then be missing out because are unable to learn, while those physically in school will continue on unaffected. Furthermore, learning at home can prove difficult for those who find it hard to focus. Going to school provides a different, somewhat unfamiliar environment in which students are not constantly distracted by everything. At home, the television, fridge, and bed can all take students' focus from learning. Students who decide to learn from home ought to be dedicated, keep themselves engaged in their virtual classrooms, and able to ignore the pulls of the soft bed with fluffy pillows and the fridge with its store of delicious food.

Oistancelearning will provide another option for students who are otherwise unable to learn in the traditional classroom setting. It will be not for the lazy but rather the driven, responsible, and committed, since not everyone possesses the level of focus required to drown out the sounds of distraction. Technology has become easy to use and relatively inexpensive, and as a result, it has introduced options that previously did not exist. In the world of education, technology will increase the quality of learning for those everywhere. ",0
1936,"Indefensible of The Electoral College

The Electoral College is widely hated throughout the United States. It's said to be a nondemocratic way of selecting a president. Each party selects a group of electors trusted to vote for their party. Mistakes happened in the past, life in 2000 when it's happened to Ale Gore. Gore had a more sufficient amount of popular votes than electoral, but Bush had more electoral, therefore Bush won and people that that was wrong or should say unfair.

There are some reasons to take away The Electoral College considering what people say or thing, it needs to be stopped.

A major issue of the Electoral College is that it's unfair to some voters. During the campaign in 2000 seventeen states didn't see candidates at all. The winnertaXeall awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. The winnertaXeall system in each state the candidates don't spend any time in states they Now the probably Now they have no chance of winning.

In the Electoral College system, voters have something called the disaster factor. Which is mainly the problem in 2000, saying to have been the biggest election crisis in a century. In some occasions some electors have said no to voting for their party's candidate and cast a vote on whom they please.

There may be good reasons to Keep the electoral college system life the certainty of outcome life it happened with Obama and Romney.

The electoral college is not fair. After the Ale Gore situation in 2000, over more that 60 percent of people would rather have a direct vote than the electoral college system. Lots of people would with Bob Dole to abolish the electoral college.",0

1938,"Many people, including nasa, believe that "" the Face"" is just a natural landform. Yes, it is odd for a landform to look like a face on a planet thet doesn't have rain fot it to erode like that. It is a very agruable topic because there is really no proof of life on Mars.

First off, the Face on mars is simply a natural landform. For all we know the face could've been there for a while but we never saw it before becasue Mars could've rotated around to that side. Also that was the first ship that NASA sent to Mars to take pictures, therefore it could be older than we think.

Secondly, the only reason it ""has"" eyes, a nose and a mouth is because of shadows and clouds. The way the light is shining upon the Face it is casting a shadow to make it appear as if it really had facial structures. It was also a cloudy time of year on Mars when the pictures were taken.

Next, Most people can agree that it is very odd for something to look like a face that isn't man-made. NASA isn't 100 percent sure that there is/ is not life on Mars. Therefore we can not make a correct statement that the Face is man-made or not.

Then, you have to take in consideration that NASA waited 18 years to go back and get more pictures. If you look closely at the pictures, the Face changed in those 18 years. It faded away naturally over the years. You can see that because you can't really see the facial structures that good anymore. If there was life on Mars they would've repaired it. If you look at the picture from 1998 at the angle the picture was taken at, it looks as if it is a mountain.

Finally, It is most likely a natural landform because it faded away never repaired. The clouds and shadows upon the Face make it appear as if it was built. There is no proof that there is or is not life on Mars. For all we know there could be aliens on Mars but NASA is not for sure that there is because they have never stepped foot on Mars. NASA has only had a rover to take pictures. Only pictures is all that NASA has.",0

People saying it's a bad idea for keeping the electoral college, and they want the popular voting for the president. The passage ""Does The Electoral College Work?"" is about keeping the electoral college or changing the system by popular voting. It's showing the negatives and positives about the two agreements. My two sources shows why not to keep the electoral colleges. ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plume is about wrongs electoral colleges such as the winner-take-all method and more. ""Source 3: In Defense Of The Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Poster is about how Electoral Colleges votes are good and how It's hard to use electoral votes by citizens. I'm against Electoral Colleges because its unfair and worthless.

I'm against Electoral Colleges because it's unfair. Its unfair because you're not voting for the president, you're voting for a slate of electors and that's not fair at all. It's not guaranteed that the person you wanted to become president will be president. The quote I have shows how electoral colleges are unfair. This quote states that ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" The candidates do not know the states because they haven't been there for a while to understand the states problems. They cannot fix it if the candidates doesn't know. Electoral college is outdated and irrational to the voters and not fair towards them either. This other quote I have can show how electoral colleges are unfair also. This quote states that ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor."" The disaster factor is that the state legislatures are responsible for picking electors, and that those electors always defy the will of the people. The system contain worse for the people and its truly unfair.

I'm against Electoral colleges because it's worthless. Its worthless because the electoral college dosen't care about the people. It's lacking on everything in the system such as responsibilities and fairness. This quote states that ""There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral college despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons."" This shows that the electoral college is lacking in things concerning the system to the electors and president. It's worthless to the voters if it's not helpful. My other quote that shows how its worthless is that ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" Democrats in Texas are one of the reasons about Electoral Colleges. Their votes will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign.

I'm against Electoral Colleges because its unfair and worthless. It's unfair to the voters and worthless if it's not involve with the voters too. People can like the Electoral Colleges, but I think it's not good for the United States of America.  ",0
1940,"An Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will Never grow. Some will say you'll grow but won't reach their beyond what they mastered. Some will disagree with Ralph Waldo Emerson statement, because doing something beyond that already master will Never stop you from doing it. IV the Days year I Delayed a Villain before I reach goal becoming beyond with a instrument that I did't know how to Day, I master how to soccer for the first when I was little, and at the end of the day your going to be beyond great when you do't give up.

When I was 6th grade iv middle school I Never though I was going to learn how to Day instrument for the first time iv my life. The instrument that I'm Vow Day is Villain my brother though I was't good enough to Day a instrument. I Practice every day to get better and to try my best. I Delayed three year iv middle school I was getting good and the I love how sound made with bows and string. The teacher once said if stop Playing the your going to forget the string Vote and how to use correctly. When I got to middle I learned how to Day a interment for the for time iv my life become beyond. I did't stop growing I kept growing to become better to Day.

Why won't we reach our goal the become beyond because doing something beyond your reaching a goal to finish. This was a time when I wait to learn how to Day a short. When I was little I wanted to Day soccer but I did't started leaving until I was 10 years old. My goal was to learn how to Day soccer, until one day I was at the Dark with my family and friend I learn how to Day soccer. My uncle tough me how to Delayed soccer for the first time.

I grew up become better the thing I love the most and did it because I had sibling following my foot step since I was the oldest iv my family.",0
1941,"I think my principle should let the students have a c average to participate in school activities. Here's why, not many students can average a b and above. Many can average c and above.

With people averaging a B and above there wouldn't be many people that could do sports. Most kids have a C. A c is okay to have. It's not failing. It's passing. There would be many more people if you let them have a C. It may even make the team better. I think they should everyone who's passing there school work do sports. It would almost be like a reward for passing. They definitely shouldn't be able to participate if lower grades.

It would be like an accomplishment to be on a team. It's also a very good way to keep your grades up. I think that should keep it at a c average and above to be on a sports team, no B and above. That's almost not fair.  ",0
1942,"Dear Senator,

I would like to argue in favor OE keeping the Electoral College. I believe that having an Electoral college vote helps the President have a greater chance OE becoming elected. This process also makes it an are game OE becoming elected for President. It's not only about the President though. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate OE electors.

As I mentioned before, having and electoral votes makes it are game for everyone. It states that the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. This means that the presidential candidate cannot get votes based on the region they are from. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a President. He gains no votes by increasing plurality in states that he knows he will win. This results with unlikely success OE the President.

The Electoral College restores some OE the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue OE the apportionment OE the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The Electoral College avoids the problem OE elections in which no candidate receives a majority OE the votes cast. When no candidate wins a majority OE the vast cast, it causes complications in the presidential election process. That's when the Electoral College steps in and produces a clear winner.

Sure it can be argued that the Electoral College method OE selecting the president may not be the best way OE getting potential voters for a candidate, but the way they do things makes it are game. It keeps the system balanced. The Electoral College is an established compromise in the Constitution brought on by the Founding Fathers. It's something original that I think should live on instead OE being taken away. The Electoral College should stay.

1943,"Facial Action Doing System is a new improved software system for find out people emotions and feelings just by their facial expressions. The Reason using technology to read students emotional expressions is valuable is because better way of getting close and personal with people, the improved way of helping people with their problems, and just by looking at a picture or word, we can make ourself feel that emotion. Those three examples are ways that this system is valuable.

One reason the system is valuable is because it is a better way of getting to know people. In the story, the author explains how Mona Lisa has different emotions in the famous picture that was made from Leonardo de Vinci. ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent careful, and 2 percent angry"". Thinking the only way possible to find out is to ask Leonardo. Well, there is a ""new software system has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others"". This quote explains how through one scan on the computer, we can find out how they are feeling. This software system is a better way of getting to know each other, but also it is a better way of helping people through their problems.

Also, a reason this system is valuable is because it is I proved system to help us help other people through their problems. ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeding simply by the look on her face."" That quote explains how facial expressions help. People can only tell if their happy, sad, mad, etc. Just mainly the basics. But with this system, you can tell how they are really feeling and be very specific. Just by raising your eyebrows, it'll tell you are curious. Or just by squinting your eyes when you're smiling, the system can tell you are happy. For a computer, that is pretty impressive. Not only you can tell their problems, but it explains how looking at different emotions make you feel the same as them.

One last reason this system is valuable is because by us just looking at picture or a word, we can make ourself feel that emotion. ""Empty (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions"". That quote explains how just by looking at a person, screen, picture, etc. we can feel the same exact emotion just because how normal and easy it is these days.

Technology has changed many ways over the passed years. Their was internet coming out, then touch screen, many websites and video calling apps, etc. But now all the way to the fact we can express and know each others emotions by just one scan on the computer. A better way of getting close and personal with people, the improved way of helping people with their problems, and just by looking at a picture or word, we can make ourself feel that emotion is the reason using technology is valuable.",0
1944,"Driverless cars Seem like they would be a good idea and could very So work, under the right conditions. Like the author Said, ""If the technology fails and Someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer?"" That is a very good question considering people that drive with children or just Starting out. I personally think that a driverless car could work if everyone would Still be alert and aware or their Surroundings. Some Companies Such as Tesla, have already projected dates to when they plan to release a driverless car.

These car Shave Sensors on them almost everywhere on the car that alert you when you are about to hit Something or tell you when you need to Start taking control, Such as in a traffic jam or if there was an accident on the road. Television and movie Shave long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves. And now that we finally have that technology, we are taking the next Step to better Safety, more quick and efficient driving in Some cases, and probably more money in the pockets of these creators as well.

The people at Google making these cars Seem to be very confident and Sure about what they are doing. These cars would almost be used as a text Service or bus transportation. But, they would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. So as far as I am concerned, driverless cars would be a great idea.",0
1945,"Driverless Cars Are Coming

IO the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" there area lot of good facts AOD opinions for the people who are for the project AOD also against.

IO that case I will have to choose the side that is for the project of making Driverless Cars.

IO my opinion i think that if we had Driverless Cars we wouldst have to worry about having to pay for tests or classes Io order to drive cars because you wouldst Need to drive if there were Driverless cars.

Also, Io my opinion Driverless Cars would help the eOviremeOt because it would use about half as much as cars would with AO individual driving it manually as stated Io Paragraph 1, Sentence 4"" The cars he(Sergey Trio) foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis AOD offer far more flexibility that a bus"".

As I said before I am for the project of making Driverless Cars.

I honestly would enjoy Not having to drive around everywhere AOD just be able to relax OO my way somewhere or OO a trip.

Also, it is kind of like you would have your two personal driver.

I would invest into this project because i think it could really help the community AOD the people because everyone struggles to get places AOD it is very hectic.

IO that case if we had Driverless Cars we wouldst have to worry about it being hectic because it would all be calm AOD everything would have order.

Also, there would be a sudden decrease Io deaths due to car accidents or road rage.

Having Driverless Cars would decrease deaths because there wouldst be anymore drunk drivers, or drivers that do drugs or any kind of products that cause hallucinations or cause problems for the drivers to see.

There wouldst be anymore deaths or accidents caused by drivers OO there foods or texting while driving because they wouldst have to drive anymore the car would drive to where they Need to go for them.

That way people can use there foods to call or text who ever they Need to while keeping everyone safe from accidents because they are Not the does driving the car it is driving itself.

People should really consider OO being for this project of making Driverless Cars, Instead of being against it.

I mean yeah there is good be a few problems Io the beginning of the making of the Driverless Cars.

So Io that case once they make the cars they can see what is wrong AOD how they can fix it so it does happen anymore.

Theo everything will be fine AOD all they have got to do is do a bit of Trial AOD Error.

People door understand that if we have Driverless cars that things would be so much easier, Because we door have to worry about any danger coming from people behind the wheel of a car.

So that means OO accidents or death or having to be worried about someone causing a wreck for wreckless driving or failure to control the vehicle.

Yes it might put some people out of jobs but look at how much good it would do for out planets air by using less fuel.

Also look at how there would be OO accidents or deaths from driving.

Therefore, there wouldst be an Need for state troopers or having to get unwanted speeding tickets or tickets for driving Io general. It would be less money for court systems, the Federal Government, also less money for people to have to pay if they received a ticket.

Also, it would droop the rates OO taxes because the government wouldst Need to pay state troopers or cops that watch for laws being broke that apply to driving a vehicle.

So people would have less things to pay AOD they could put that money towards their kids education.

This would allow more kids to got college AOD future their education.

meaning more jobs would be created AOD a lot more people wouldst be poor or homeless because they wouldst Need to pay as many taxes or have to pay insurance OO a vehicle or even have to pay money to two one. Therefore, it would drop the rates OO people being homeless AOD poor.

Also, it would put more kids Io school

So this is why I am for the project of making Driverless cars.

IO my opinion i just think it would help out a lot more things that make things worse.

I believe it would help more that anything because we wouldst have to worry about a lot of stuff with vehicles.

So this is my argument against the people who believe that we should have Driverless Cars. I believe it will do more good that harm that is why I am for this project to make Driverless Cars instead of against it.",0
1946,"Yes, I do think School's should other online class; For the students who live YAR away, or any students who would like to take an online course. It is very beneficial For students who learn better in a quieter environment. Their are up's and down's For online classes. Some positive things could be, Its taken online, where ever you want, on your laptop, computer, smartphone, tablet. Some negative things could be, you Feel like you have enough time to Finish your work, but the deadline sneaks up on you or in you have bad internet. It has For me, when I took an online course over the summer.

I once took an online class through my public high school. It was terrific, I had received a total score of eighty eight percent in that online course. The course I took was Algebra two, and I took the course over the summer when I was in Generic_City. I did have many complications when I was there. I had terrible internet over there, because I had many cousins visiting and so many electronics devices were connected. The online course site was terribly made, it wasn't student Friendly at all. The site Froze many times when I was using it. It had many other computer bugs too.

The only good thing about the online course that I liked, was that you can turn in your assignment any time before the course actually ends, it will not cause you to lose points. When I was taking the online course, I wasn't doing much I was just guiding around with my cousins and not getting my assignments submitted. I was really behind by Your or Five chapters. When the deadline was coming up, I started doing the assignments after everyone was asleep. I stayed awake For three days straight, until I had Finished all my assignments.

Online classes are really beneficial For the students who like to work in a quiet area, also the students who don't like to come to school. These online classes take nine months of information and work and It it to three months of work. Schools should have online courses For the students who want to take it.",0

Venus is a planet from our solar system is simple to see from the distant, exploring Venus is a Challenge because present dangers. Numerous factors Contribute to Venus's reputation. More Challenging are the Clouds of highly Corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere; NASA is working to studying Venus.

First, ""Venus, sometimes Called the"" Evening Star, is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot"" because is simple to see from the distant. ""It has proved a very Challenging place to examine more Closely.""  exploring Venus present dangers because is a planet Close to sun.

Second, numerous factors Contribute to Venue's reputation for study to humans.""often referred to as Earth's ""twin"" because Venus is Closest to Earth in different factors like density, size and sometimes in distances too.

Third,"" Even more Challenging are the Hours of highly Corrosive sulfuric acid in Venue's atmosphere"" because their Conditions are extreme to humans on Earth. High pressure, geology and weather present additional impediments to see:

NASA is working to studying Venus, and they try different things using materials with different elements to see how reaction each one for example; ""some simplified electronics made of silicon Carbide have been tasted in a Chamber simulating the Chaos of venue's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such Mentions.""

In Conclusion, really exploring Venus is a difficult Challenge because different factors are impediments to humans to study Close. Weather, high temperatures and geology is not a good help to know more about Venus because not reaction like on others planets like Earth.

1948,"Allowing call phones in classrooms it can BB a benefit for some students and a disadvantage for others. Although some say that call phones should BB allowed in classrooms because they believe that using call phones in THB classroom it can help students to research for a project, or it can help to do any other assignment. Actually it shouldn't because students can chat during a test and they GBT distracted.

Some say that call phones shouldn't BB allowed in classrooms because students can chat during a test and they GBT distracted. For example on bday my English teacher told MB that she let her students to USB their phone during a test to search something about THB meaning of THB words that they dobs't know. Then, she told MB that she told them that they can only USB their phones to translated THB words that they dobs't know what it means or to translated to their own language. After that she says that she gave to her students THB test and she went to seat to her disk, but then she was observing that ONB of her students was using his phone too frequently, she went to SBB what THB student was searching and she saw that THB student was searching for THB answers of THB questions that THB test have. After that, she saw that ONB of THB others students was taking pictures of THB beam, she went to SBB why THB student was taking pictures of THB beam, she ask him that why he was taking pictures of THB beam and he told her that he was sending THB answers to his friend who was sitting in THB backs bat.

Moreover, she told MB that THB other day that she was explaining THB class, some students BRB using their phone and paying less attention to THB class. Also, she says that THB students who BRB using their phones during THB class when they got THB test they dobs't know what to answer because they BRB distracted with their phones and they got a lower score in THB beam. I believe that call phones shouldn't BB allowed in classroom because is a distraction for students, sometimes there ARB students that when THB teacher is explaining THB class they ARB using their phones and when THB teacher gave them a test they got bad score in their test and that can BB a problem because their grades can GBT very lower.

Those who believe that call phones should BB allowed in classrooms have their reasons, they believe that using call phones in THB classroom it can help students to research for a project, or it can help to do any other assignment. ONB example can BB my friend Generic_Name, his history teacher always gave him assignments that he have to search in THB book about THB Civil War or World War II. He told MB that it's very complicated for him to search some things about those tittles in THB book because THB books dobs't have enough details for him to what to put in his assignment or sometimes he dobs't know how to summarize THB meaning of THB paragraphs that THB book have. However, when THB teacher let him USB his phone he began to search about THB tittles that he have to search and he says that it's more base for him to understand more about those tittles because he is using his phone for a educational purpose. Also, he says that when he plays Kahoot or Quizlet live (
those ARB learning games that sometimes THB teachers USB to help students to study

) he learn more than when he road a book. In my point of view I believe that call phones should BB allowed in school because for MB sometimes is very complicated to road a book because there ARB some words that I don't understand, but when I USB my phone to search it's more base because in THB phone there ARB some meanings that I understand.

In summary, some say that call phones shouldn't BB allowed in classroom because students can chat during a test and they GBT distracted. However, some believe that call phone should BB allowed in classrooms because it can help students to research for as project and to do any other assignment. In my opinion I believe that call phones should BB allowed in school because it base for MB to search THB meaning of a word that I don't know and If bbl that I learn more then trading a book.",0
1949,"Is There Really a Face on Mars???

The landform on Mars is simply not a face or supernatural thing. This is just a mesa that has the resemblance of a face. Many say that it's evidence that supernatural beings actually exist on Mars but, there's simply not enough evidence to support that claim. Also, it's a landform that can only be caused by natural/ geological changes. The so called 'face' can't be man-made (supernatural).

When picture were taken of the mesa, it was during winter on the planet. Also, the Viking 1 was only able to take the picture with 43 meters per pixel. When scientist tried to snap the picture again in 1998 it was during winter of the planet also and the camera had to cut through wispy clouds. So in 2001, on a clear summer day, the picture was finally taken. The difference with this photo and the one from 1976 is that the 2001 photo was taken with 1.56 meters per pixel whereas the 1976 picture was taken at 43 meters per pixel.

Now some people may say' Well how come the 'face' is in that exact spot, and it doesn't move ?' To be honest it would be the same as asking' Why is Mount. Everest in the same spot and never moves ?' Now do you see the logic. The reason those landforms don't move is that the landforms were created by the planet (Again not man or supernaturally made).

Ultimately, through advances in technology and knowledge about relating planets, this isn't a face on Mars. It is considered to be a natural made mesa. With the pictures taken, they had variables of why they looked how they looked, except the 2001 picture. Some cameras weren't as powerful as the pictures that were later taken. Also, the conditions were different, so it was hard to get a good, clear shot. Believing some conspiracy theorist isn't always the best choice due to the lack of evidence that is provided to support the claim.",0
1950,"The electoral college is a very important this to keep when residing the president. Our founding father established this process in the constitution. The president has to have transregionaD appear he can't just have a Dot of states on his side. It is true that public voters don't directly vote for the president and sometimes the electors may not vote for the right person.

The process of the electoral college is written in the constitution by our founding fathers. It's a compromise between Congress votes and the peoples votes. To win the electoral votes you have to have 270 votes witch is the majority of the votes. All candidates has his or hers own group of electors that are choose by the political party.

The president candidate has to have transvaginal appear because a candidate with Regina appear is unlikely to win. If a candidate were to campaign heavily in one region he or she wide gain no electoral votes. So the candidates have to go crews country and not stick to one region to study gain anything. A candidate can make every person in one region vote for him. But the candidate that go crosses country have a better change of wining because they have more electoral votes.

Yes a public vote does not go direct to helping a person win, but it does help. If there were no editor codded a candidate could go to add the heavily populated STAE and get add those votes and be pay in to office Dike that. Just because you are voting for a state of electors doesn't mean you are not voting. The public votes go two red helping choose the electors that vote for the president.

The electoral college is a good thing to have when voting for the president. It's a compromise between congress and the citizens that was set by the founding fathers. It makes it so that a candidate can't just win over one part of the Connery and win; he or she has to win over the majority of the people. Yes you are voting for people to vote for you, but your votes choose those people. The electoral codded is a grate prose to have and keep.",0
1951,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something?. We accomplish excellent grades at school by studying , at sports by practicing everyday and never giving up to become an amazing player, and at work by learning and giving a lot of effort to realize our goals.

First of all, students stay after school or ask for a raise pass to study more about the subject they have a test or quiz.

In the actuality, there is a lot of schools from South America like Peru, Chile, Bolivia, etc. that do not have after school or raise pass for students to study more. Some students have to pay approximate 30 dollars per hour for a personal teacher to help them at home. Students from South America do not have the facility to study with their teachers without paying for extra classes. Another example, when I came to United States, there was a day that I had an important test, and I did not know nothing about the topic. So, I stayed after school with my teacher, and we practiced a lot. When I took the test, I answered all the questions without problem. The next day, my teacher gave me back the test and I was the highest grade of the class. That made me stayed more often at school with my teachers to study different classes. Furthermore, to get good grades, students have to do homework, projects, and participate a lot in class.

Secondly, it is important for people that want to get better at sports to practice everyday to become an excellent player.

Additionally, people success in sports, when they never give up and try to learn by their mistakes. When I was in Generic_City, at school I was part of a volleyball team, and we played against another school. That day, I was not ready to play with the other school. My team lost the game because I did not played good. I did not want to play anymore, because I was scared of losing again. But I did not give up because I was fascinated with this sport and

I kept practicing and becoming better at volleyball.

I know that the best way to success at sports is practicing all the time, and never give up in something that you love. I learned that if I stayed in inactivity, and do not practice, I would never become a good player in volleyball.

Finally, people accomplish at work when they do new projects to grow the company each day. Another reason is, people have to be responsible with their duties at work. Besides, if you want to get a higher level position, then you can do it by learning more about your job and showing your effort and hard working everyday. In this days, is hard to get a good and stable job because it requires effort and knowledge, but being active and always doing something to make a wonderful work will let you find an amazing job. By the other hand, being idle can give you bad consequences like, you can be fired, never find a job or never be successful in life.

I am sure that most people accomplish more when they study at school to get good grades, at sport when they practice and believe in themselves to become an extraordinary player, and at work when they learn and give a lot of effort to fulfill their goals. ",0

1953,"Venus is a very dangerous planet and has harsh storms, earthquakes, and a bad atmosphere. But despite all that, the studying of Venus is more important than worrying about the dangers that lurk there. In the article ""The Challenge of

Exploring Venus"" the author also supports this claim pretty well.

In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He explains that Venus has very harsh conditions that you couldn't live there or even land there without surviving for only a few hours. It has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 % Carbon Dioxide, there are clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere, and the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees. They even say such conditions could crush a submarine or melt any metal.

However, despite all that information I just gave you, the author still thanks its important that we study Venus in the future. He goes on to say"" why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"", and then explains that astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the Earthlike planet in our solar system. The author suggests that Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. He even states"" Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth.

The author gone on to say, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?"".

He begins to say that was has an idea for sending Humans to study Venus. It would allow scientist to float above the scorching ground and just hover in the air.

Finally, in the last paragraph of this article really shows how much he thinks that studying Venus is more than important than worrying about the dangers of the planet. The author states"" striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Out travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"".

In conclusion the author supports his opinion on studying Venus is more important than worrying about dangers. He supports this opinion by stating that Venus is a crazy planet but still says why we should explore. He even says Venus could've been most Warlike planet out there, and earth still has similar features.",0
1954,"After I graduated from high school I made a life changing choice and that was to go to Europe with my friend and while I was in Europe I joined the ""Seagoing Cowboys"". And I want you to make that same choice. And I don't want you to just think that I'm asking you to join for no reason I'm asking you to join because the benefits are perfect.

I also would want you to join because you can travel all around the world and help animals who need help. Wouldn't you want to travel around and help animals in need? And on top of that you meet new people, and it may seem like work but it doesn't feel like work at all It's actually pretty fun.

If I were you I would join right now. The list of reasons goes on and on but if I were to write them all down I would need to write a book. So instead of me writing a book why don't you just join, and I promise you will love it. And if you don't you can always quit, but I highly doubt that you won't love it. You can either take the information that I'm giving you and go for it or not even try at all. But the choice is yours to join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"". Please and thank you.",0
1955,"If you could, would you want to live on a different planet? Well according to the author, studying a different planet such as genus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring genus,"" the author supports his or her idea well and has many examples to back himself up. The author talks about the similarities genus has to Earth, the dangers of genus, and what scientists are doing to make going to genus a possibility.

Despite the dangers of studying genus, there are many reasons why it is a worthy pursuit. The author states in the article,""Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" genus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" This shows that even though genus is dangerous, there are similarities that make it worthwhile to study, if that means one day having another planet similar to Earth.

In the article, there are many dangers of genus. According to the text, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets genus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in genus's atmosphere."" This shows the challenges of studying genus because the percent of carbon dioxide and high corrosive sulfuric acid are too much for humans or even some spacecrafts. Another danger is the temperature. Oenus averages a surface temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. That is beyond temperatures at which we humans can withstand. To show the severity of the atmospheric pressure, the author states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" These dangers may seem like it isn't a worthy pursuit, but the author goes on to describe just why and how scientist should pursue genus. The article states that long ago genus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. To add on to that, today, genus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. This is a good example to support that the author supports his or her claim because it is describing what was and is still good about genus. The top example that supports the authors claim is what the scientists have already done to begin the search of genus. According to the article, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of genus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimplike vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" This supports the author's claim because despite the dangers of genus, the scientists have found a way to study genus at a more suitable, safer way. Maybe not as efficient, but it saves the lives of the astronauts.

In conclusion, the author supports his or her claim well because of all the evidence and examples that are used in the text. Stating the similarities of Earth show that it is worthwhile to study genus when the outcome could possibly be a planet that is like a second Earth. Describing the dangers of genus but then talking about how the scientists can get around those dangers supports the author's claim because the readers see that even though genus is dangerous, there are still valuable ways to study it, meaning that studying genus is a worthy pursuit.",0
1956,"The students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

Is better study from home because some students no have the time for study in school, because a lot students in the world that have that working for following her goals and being somebody in life. In the world has students that also working for careful the his parents or help at her brothers. Some students that want study in school by can not do, because sometime the family was passing by a situation difficult the money and so don't have more famalies that helping, is unique way that her children's work for that help at her family, and so some students can follow to study in her home. All the students that study in her home for online have that being responsible.

First, some students that have that working for help at her parents and also study in home. For example, Generic_Name that working everyday the week him want that her parents have a better life economic. Generic_Name to take a choice to go out the school and Generic_Name put at working. Him search the best way for have a job and help at her family with expense the home, Generic_Name also study choice take classes in home every night.

Generic_Name learned the her mistakes and finish her studies and now she was in the university study for nurse, and is a better person and responsable with her studies.

In conclusion, some students that not like study in school and home,some parents working everyday for that her sons can have a better future and being somebody in life. many people no have money for that her sons study for online, the students the day now think that best way is to leave school and follow study more but also can study in the home and the sometime have a job and pay her studies and help at her parents. and follow study for that day the tomorrow do more better and peoples with respect, and help the poeple poor.",0
1957,"Have you ever wanted to travel to another country, but also get a pay check for doing it? If you have ever wanted this, then you might want to consider becoming a Seagoing Cowboy or Cowgirl.

We get to work with many animals. Our job is to swift transfer animals from one country to another. We have to take care of all the animals. Some trips can have over a hundred animals going from one place to another, but you'll get to feed, water, play with, and care for all the animals.

When you're a Seagoing Cowboy, you get to travel all over Europe. I made nine trips to different countries and had extra time to tour famous sites such as the Acropolis in Greece and

I took a gondola ride through the watery streets of Venice, Italy. You'll be able to go to Italy and Greece too, but you will also be able to go to China and Panama.

The job of a Seagoing Cowboy is very safe and will most of us will likely return to our families after our war service is up, or we retire. A Seagoing Cowboy also doesn't have to fight on the battlefield during wars. If they are drafted, they just pay their service by doing their job like I did. We help to struggle countries to recover after wars, so we are already doing their war service.

If any of these benefits appeal to your interests, then you might want to sign up to be a Seagoing Cowboy along with me. It's a safe, interesting, and all around enjoyable job.",0
1958,"Driverless cares are the future. They are going to be great! With driverless cars we have to worry less about our safety and everyone else's safety.

Safety is always key, and these cars are safe. In this article it states, ""In reality, Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have riven more than half a million miles without a crash"" (Paragraph 2). These, driverless cars, have been proven to be safe. There are many people who have not had wrecks before, so yeah, those people are safe drivers. But, there are also people who have had one or multiple wrecks, and all of them may not be there fault, but they still have been in a wreck. The driverless cars Google has been testing have not had a wreck yet! The though of driverless cars taking over the world and us not having to worry about losing anyone to a car wreck ever again is amazing.

Another good attribute about driverless cars is that they follow the rules. The cars do not speed, or run red lights, or not stop at stop signs, they follow the rules. Some of those rules are also leading cause of wrecks; people who are driving out of control way over the speeding limit, or someone running a red light in a rush, and they pull out in front of someone and cause and accident, also if they just do not think they have to stop at a stop sign and someone going the other way does not have to stop, or they already did stop, and it was their turn to go. Also, the number one and two things that get most people in wrecks, texting and drinking. People do not have to worry about a driverless care texting someone back or on the phone looking at social media. Driverless cares do not get distracted. People also will not see a driverless car in a bar getting drunk. It just will not happen. The driverless cars will not be pulled over for being intoxicated or swerving because they will not be intoxicated and will be driving safely.

Now some people are going to argue and say, ""These really aren't driverless cars, you still have to drive them."" Yes, they are true, as of now. But people should be fine with having to take the wheel sometimes. The text states, ""Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents"" (Paragraph 2). And it also says, ""...none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"" (Paragraph 7). So they are correct when they say they are not truly driverless. But for now that is the technology we have we should accept it, and who would not want to feel as if they were in control during situations such as a wreck, or a work zone. And it we all ended up having driverless cares we would not have to worry about us having to take over the car through a wreck zone because these cars do not wreck.

The one downside is that the next generation of kids will never get to really learn how to drive. That's most peoples favorite thing to do when they get to the age to drive. They all want to go out to their car and take it for a spin. The next generation will not have to learn with driverless cars. Now, since they do not know any better because they will not see their parents driving, they may not miss it as much, but they will be missing out on a privilege it has been for many generations of people all across the world. But on the other side as parents, we will be glad to know that we will not ever have to worry about our kids being in a wreck or dying in a wreck, and we will always know they will safely make it to where they are going.

The future is coming and everyone needs to be ready! Driverless cars are a great thing to come to this planet and everyone should be excited. Safety has always been something everyone in this whole world wants, and with driverless cars, we get that.",0

1960,"Every four years, the United States is turned into a political battleground by the campaign for presidency.  The electoral College, the voting method used since the nation began, Is being highly questioned on its efficiency now vs the efficiency 250 years ago. However, the system has survived because it works.  Despite its flaws, the Electoral College does a good job of simplifying the presidential election and eliminating disputes or a potential crisis.  It produces a clear winner, it makes sure that the president is popular in all areas of the country, and it puts the weight of the campaign on the swing states.

In most president races, the president wins only by a small margin.  Rarely is there a landslide victory or a complete vote for a president.  This small majority can lead to many disputes over the credibility of counting the votes in the individual states.  This is why the Electoral College helps the voting process.  The Electoral College helps the voting process because it produces a more clear winner.  For example, in line 21 it claims that ""In [2012's] election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney"".  This shows that while the popular vote can be extremely tight, the winner gaining sometimes less than 1 percent of the popular votes, the Electoral College helps the system by giving the winner a landslide advantage and therefore clearing up any claims over the credibility of the popular votes which the loser can produce.  Also, the Electoral College helps prevent the situation of no president winning the majority of the votes.  The introduction of third parties can sometimes mean that no party gains more than half of the votes.  However, the Electoral College helps deal with that situation.  In 1968 and 1992, Nixon and Clinton both had less than the majority, but won because they had the Electoral College in their favor.  This is why the Electoral College still works today.

There are some areas of the nation that are very highly populated.  The southern and western regions of the nation are becoming more and more populated, and the northern regions are diminishing in size.  By popular vote, a president who wins the southern regions alone would have a good chance of winning the nation.  However, that system does not work under the electoral college vote. The Electoral College is a good system for voting on the president because it requires a president to be popular across the nation.  Under the Electoral College, a president can not suffice by winning the votes in a couple of states.  They must get points from states across the nation and then will it add up to a victory.  This is good because a president with only a regional majority will mainly focus on the region which he is based on.  The other regions will be disregarded, and not paid as much attention to.  The Electoral College prevents this outcome.  This is another reason why the Electoral College is a good method of picking the presidency.

Most states will have a tendency to almost always vote for a particular party.  The real difference in Electoral votes lies mostly in the states who will vote either way, or 'Ewing States"".  The Electoral College is a good thing because it puts the emphasis on the states who will vote either way, ensuring the credibility of the candidate.  These swing states know that they are the ones who decide the election.  Therefore, it is the voters in these states who pay more attention to the campaign, who research the candidates more, and who listen to what the candidates have to say.  This is a bonus for the Electoral College because it means that the candidate who will be elected is the candidate who will do best for the country, not necessarily the most popular.  Because of this, the Electoral College should remain the system of voting on the presidency.

There are arguments that the Electoral College should be abolished.  That the system of sending electors to congress to vote for them does not work because they can't guarantee that the electors will vote for who they are supposed to do.  However, the chances of that happening today and the elector getting away with it are very slim.  Today, The people and the government know exactly how many votes each state gave to each candidate, and they know exactly how much electoral votes a candidate should get.  Eo even if you manage to add a vote to your candidate, It's very likely that someone will do the math and figure out that something's not right with the votes.

Like every system, the Electoral College has its flaws.  However, the system is the best we can put in place to elect a new president.  The system still is used after 250 years because it easily simplifies the disputes that can easily occur over the tight popular vote margins.  Eo the next time you vote for the president, You'll know that you are voting in the most efficient democratic system to date.",0

Felt the experince of ""The Mona Lisa demostration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do"".

People are feeling even when they are trying to hide their motions because in a new technology can describe the human motions. They know that the painting of Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted they calculate the facial expressions for each emotion universal. The motions of any students in a clasroom computer are confused or bored. In the painting many know the feeling motions of her smile but have 83 percent happy in her smile.

In the painting of Mona Lisa is 6 percent fearfun and 2 percent angry. This is painting to recorgnize for many people in all the world, because is an painting of Leonardo da Vinci's. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games to learn more about the motions of people. An example of the text is ""Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of Da Vanci Code"".

The theory of motion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. The Mona Lisa demostration expression is really intended to bring a smile to your face. The new motion-recognition sofware tracks these facial basic motions are happiness, surprise, anger, sadness, fear, and disgust. The facial emotions for universal to many students want to investige the painting of Mona Lisa. Many use the same techonology for conclude the different motions of the painting. The students can talk about the experince of the Mona Lisa demostration of her emotions about a painting very good.

The painting of Mona Lisa is very famous in the world however many students can use the new technology to learn more about the human motion.",0
1962,"Driverless Cars are the furture of the automoblie. No crashes have happened to googles smart cars so far. They take up less gas, saying ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis."" Those are just two of many reasons why driveless cars are going to change America.

The small amount that driverless cars have actully driven there hasn't been one issue with crashing into other objects. Yes there are still bugs that still need to be fixed. The cars can not at this time pull out or pull in a driveway, they also can not tell when road work is happening or when there has been a crash on the road. All things when they first start are a little bit buggy but that doesn't mean in two to five years that things could get fixed. When those bugs do get fix we could see a crashless world.

In the artical they are talking about a driverless taxi's sevice, that is more cost friendly and more flexable than the buses. Gas isn't high cost like it use to be but when you're driving people from one part of town to another side, the gas bill started to stack up. Driverless cars always take the shortest route and are just more gas friendly then your average taxi. Cutting that gas bill in half will safe more money to put back into your company or the communtiy. Gas had always been in high demand the driverless car could stop that.

The only thing keeping us from those driveless car in the laws and the bugs that they do have but again in two to five years both of those could have change the way we see cars forever. The prices of gas will fall, there will be less driving issues. The world has we know it will be safer and less popluted with less Co2 coming from every oned cars. ",0

1964,"Actress and singer Audrey Hepburn once remarked, ""Nothing is impossible. The word itself say I'm possible!"" The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" agrees. They claim that although venturing to a planet that is seeminly un-explorable is dangerous, it is also a worthwhile and necessary mission. By justifying why it is crucial to continue our efforts to explore Venus, and additionally through their explanation as to how this can safely be accomplished, the author of this article strongly supports their idea that studying Venus is a noble pursuit despite the many obstacles that it creates.

One way that the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports their claim is by explaining the sheer value and benefit of going to Venus. While it is true that several conditions on Venus' surface are inhospitable and unable to support or sustain human life, the author claims that ""astronomers are fascniated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system,"" (para 4). This might lead to discoveries that could help us understand or predict Earth's future evolution patterns. Besides this, Venus is at times the closest planet to Earth as ""Earth, Venus and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus,"" (2). This could be extremely beneficial to both the inhabitants of earth and for future space travel because Venus will sometimes be our ""nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel,"" (4). All of these statements and claims that the author make support his/her claim that the exploration of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it entails as they are quite literally explaining to their readers why exploration is as important as it is. This tactic has the ability to make audiences aware of the importance of such a mission, and hopefully persuade them to agree.

Additionally, the author supports his/her claim by revealing how a mission to Venus can be carried out in a safe, mannerly way. This, in turn, aids in convincing readers that might have originally disgareed with the author due to the fact that Venus' ""conditions are fare more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine assustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals,"" (3). The author, after making this counterclaim, refutes it by talking of some solutions to this ever-looming issue: ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape,"" (5). The author talks of how the air pressure, temperature and radiation would all be survivable for humans. Some, such as the air pressure 30 miles above Venus, would be almost identical to Earth at sea level. The author also disscusses other potential solutions, such as possibly using silicon carbide, a material that has ""been tested in a chmaber simulating the chaos of Venus' surface and [has] lasted for three weeks in such conditions,"" (7). These all are possible ways to make a trip to Venus much safer and, more importantly, they all help support the author's claim.

Overall, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" makes a claim that although Venus has some exceptionally dangerous conditions, it is a planet worth exploring. They support this claim very well by explaining the importance of going to Venus, and providing a few solutions that might reduce the risk factor of this type of mission. All in all, this author, much like Audrey Hepburn, proves through this article that they feel that nothing is truly impossible, not even a trip to Venus. After all, like Hepburn says, the word does state ""I'm possible!""",0
1965,"With the advancement in technology in our society the need for cars has become are Very big necessity. But recently in Freiburg, Germany they do they have stopped the use of cars and many don't even own them. A woman by the name hadron Walter said ""I'm much happier this way, I used to be a lot more tense when I had a car"". Currently, not having cars have helped the community be a better place, many ride bicycles places, and you can hear the sound of children playing in the streets ""drowning out the sound of distant motors."" More recently however planners for this organization are trying to make their way towards the suburbs. The reason they are working to make a car free nation is because recently Passenger cars are the reason for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and it even goes up to 50% in some carintensiFe areas in the U.S.!

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency promotes ""car reduced"" communities, even legislators are starting to act. With the decrease of cars it would bring many benefits, You would have fewer deaths from drunk driving or driving in general, It would be safer for your children to play in the streets, pollution would go down to a low, the chances of rode rage would go to a Very low, and no cars would also mean many stores would be built closer to homes so its in walking distance. Also, we would most likely have more public transport so the need for cars wouldn't be needed.

Another place that is working their way into being car free is Bogotá, Colombia; Recently they had a specific day when millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work because it was a car free day. Violators faced $25 fines if they went against it. Even with rain people have still participated, people know that they are making the community a better place one car less at a time. It has also been a good opportunity to lower stress and air pollution in our environment. For the first time two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar also joined the event. Even Municipal authorities from other countries came with enthusiasm to see this event. One of them by the name Enrique Rear stated ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders."" This campaign had started in the mid1990s and has since cause the construction of 118 bike paths according to the city mayor. Also parks and sports centers have become a bigger thing and have been built all throughout the city. uneven sidewalks have been replaced with fresh neat side walks, rush hours restrictions have cut traffic, and new shopping and restaurants of started to show.

Recently in Paris After days of near record pollution, Paris had to ban all driving because the smog was just way too bad. It was so bad that they would fine you $31 if you got caught leafing the house with a car. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and TwentyseFen had their cars impounded for their reaction. Cold nights and warm days are the main cause of the car trap emissions. Diesel fuel was also blamed since France has a tax policy that put diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of Vehicles in France, Compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of West Europe.",0
1966,"Dear teacher_NAME, 2/15/11

I heard that you were considering two different policies about cell phones on campus.

Many students are going to be happy that you are considering to change the current rule about cell phones, but I think that the second policy is the way to go.

No cell phones of campus is the best for many reasons.

First, they are extremely distracting because if we are allowed to have them, that is all we will be worrying about.

I know, personally, that my cell phone can make me a different person.

Yexting can be addicting, as most teenagers will tell you, but if you allow us to have phones on campus, we are likely to be on it all the time.

Some will say, ""I can get away with it"" or ""the teacher won't even know.""

Nine times out of ten, if we have them at one point of the day, they are likely to stay with us and not be put away when they are supposed to be.

Second, many teenagers can be bullied over the phone.

One kid will act like he is someone too else to trick another, and that will turn out to be bad because that person was not who they said they were.

Another reason is that if there are two people who don't like each other, and one of them gets hold of the other's number, they can say extremely mean things.

Finally, cell phones are too much of a distraction for us to be allowed to have them on campus.

I hope that you take my opinion into consideration and help it influence your decision.

Yhank you for taking the time to read this.

1967,"Driverless cars are on the verge of coming out and will be good for all people on the roads. Driverless cars will nit only take away the risk of human error but will help to decrease accidents that are happening all around the world because of human error. Humans make more mistakes than machines, so driverless cars are less prone to be in accidents.

Machines are very accurate and make very few mistakes if any. As paragraph two says, ""Televisions and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves."" Driverless cars would be a huge breakthrough in science and engineering. I think that there shouldn't be any driverless cars right now, but in a few years the technology that will be out will be safe and trustworthy. I would trust driverless cars in a few more years when the technology is more advanced and sophisticated. In paragraph 2 it says, ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless."" The big car companies agree that the driverless car technology won't be out for a couple of more years because it is too dangerous right now to trust them, they say that cars aren't truly driverless yet when it comes to driving in traffic jams or in construction zones because there are some problems that we probably don't know about yet, but through time we can figure out to make the driverless cars more safe.

Another reason why driverless cars would be a better go to is because it could help from polluting the atmosphere with exhaust. In paragraph 1 Sergey Brin envisions fleets of driverless cars form a public transport taxi system that uses half of the fuel that taxi cabs use today. With less fuel consumption, the environment and atmosphere will not get as polluted with gas east. Also, with less fuel being consumed by the cars, There will be less money spent on gas which could help you save money for more things that you want.

Another feature that you can get from driverless cars is relaxing and spending more time with the people you are with. If you are by yourself you could catch up with the news or take a quick nap and get some extra rest for wherever you are going. In paragraph 8 it says, ""Some manufacturers hope to bring Inca entertainment and information systems that use head sup displays."" So while you are kicked back in your seat you can turn on a movie or bring a book and enjoy your book while your car transports you to your destination.

Driverless cars are the future and will bring many technological advances with it. All through time these self driving cars will come out and amaze the world with all of their abilities. Whether you are for, or against, everyone will be amazed if these SCIFI vehicles are actually produced and used by the common folk. Until then, the world will wait for the best technological advancement in history to come out.",0
1968,"Dear school principal,

I China that the should use Policy 1.

You should use it, because if the teacher tells the student that the volleyball practice is canceled and if you don't have an office phone, then the student can't tell his/her parents about it.

Also, another reason is that, the students won't have to Keep on complaining about not having their phone all the time.

When the students get out of school, (on the bus) they can call their parents, if they are going to a friends house.

They can also call the parents with their cell phones, when their after school activity is done, so then the parents can pica them up.

What if there is an emergency(life a flood is coming) and the office phone is broken. Then, they could get their cell phones out and call their parents and tell them about it, so then the parents can pica them up, before the emergency comes.

The students can call their friends at lunch(if their friend has a phone or has the same lunch as them), so then they could just sit their talking on the phone, while eating.

If the student don't turn their cell phones off during class time, then you should punish them by giving them(any of these):

a detention

write an essay that's about why they didn't turn their cell phones off

 apologize to their teacher and let the teacher do the rest

Than you for your time.

1969,"When you get stuck on something whether it is to buy a cat or buy a dog. You always ask someone their opinion right? Pf you don't, you really should, it can help you make great decisions like, whether should you buy that cat or chose that job. That's why Pm here to show you why asking opinions with multiple people is a great thing.

Let's say you want to go on a cruise, and you ask your friends and family their opinions about money wise, your friends most likely think it's really cool, worth the money you can pay it off right. You're thinking, ""Yeah, this sounds like so much fun and it's not that much P will work over time.""

On the other hand your parents are thinking maybe It's not so worth it your already in college dept that you need to pay off why have another thing. So you think to your self, ""Maybe she's right this would be fun but P just really can't pay for it right now."" This is why it is so important to ask multiple people opinions because they may be bias to the subject or don't want the best for you.

Let's say you want to buy a dog, your first dog. You don't know much about taking care of dogs, so you ask a few people their opinion on your choice, your family loves the choice even though they never had a dog. So you go to ask your friends they say, ""Yeah! You totally should do that, it would be so cute."" Now you go ask an experienced coworker he says,"" Your dog can be one of the best things that happened in your life, but you have to find the right moment, because if you work too much and can't take care of it it's not worth it to you and your dog. Also, it is a lot of money and time, you have to pay almost 100 dollars a month just to feed it on top of your time, taking it on walks in the morning, middle of the day, and at night. Pt just not might be fit for you right now."" So you take that into you pile of opinions, sure its fun and cute but maybe your not ready for it, it's not fair to the dog. This is also another reason why you should ask multiple people their opinions. Because some people may say something to you, you never thought of before.

So you want to either go to the army or the navy, and you need help with choosing, you love the land and the sea so that's not a problem. You go to ask your family they might be full ride or not they love you so they don't want you making a decision that could maybe cause you your life. Now, you ask your friends about it, they say army because its cooler, and you get to shoot guns. You realize they weren't much help, so you ask an army man and a navy man, they tell you all the things you have to go through in training and in the real world, you think about all the possibilities and dangers for going into it, you haven't thought about when you asked your friends. You realize sometimes asking people can change your life recently, it also can save your life, and change it forever

The whole purpose of this was to show you that asking multiple people for their opinion can help you and the surrounding others a lot, you get to see the whole story, maybe they are experienced in the topic, or if the people you ask have no knowledge you know to just go to more people for more opinions. Thank you for reading this and P hope P changed your mind on asking opinions.  ",0
1970,"I think students would not benefit taking online classes or videos conferencing from home. Students not learn too much because they do not receive a good explication about the class as a real teacher would to explains in the school, not have rulers and online classes not catches the students' attention.

Students not learn too much taking online class because they need to receive a good explication about the class, as real a teacher explains in the school. For example, if you are a student, but you have questions and doubts, but the classes online or videos conferencing does not answer and give you good explications about the class. Would you learn while you are keeping in mind all your questions and doubts? Other reason is that students do not learn taking online classes from home because they get confusion, not understand the class, and they give up when nobody helps them.

Would you be able to do the right thing when there are no rulers taking a class? Electronics devices are the most powerful and useful tools that help us nowadays like cellphones, smartwatch and computers. However, many students are using electronic devices in the wrong way. For example, students that are taking online classes from home, they don't have rulers, and they are using their phones to watch movies or testing with friends. This steal the students' concentration, while they are taking the online classes. This can not happen during a normal day of school because teachers do not allow students to use electronics devices during class time. But students do not have the same rulers at home that teachers makes at school. This not benefit the knowledge of the students at home.

Online classes or videos conferencing not catches the students' attention like a teacher makes it. For example, if you are taking online classes from home, and you are at the midpart of one the lesson, but you get hungry then, you left the lesson to get eat. After eat you say, ""I want to go to the park,"" then, you, went to the park, so forged all about your lesson. Would you be able to do the same during a normal day of class in the school? A teacher does not allow that a student left the school or to go to the park at the midpart of the class, while he is teaching because he wants to catch your attention to make you to learn more and more. However, online classes or videos conferencing you can stop it and go or do whatever you want, then you lose knowledge about it.

Some say that taking online classes or videos conferencing from home is a benefit for students. They are wrong because the students not learn too much, and they would have bad grades. Others say that online classes or videos conferencing explain in good details. They are wrong because real teachers explain better than online class or videos conferencing.

As you can see, taking online classes or videos conferencing from home, not helps the students to learn because if they are confusing they will get bad grades, nobody answers their question or doubts, and they don't have rulers or limited to use any electronics devices. This is not a benefit for students.",0
1971,"The problem with driverless car: what if the car stops driving and the driver doesn't know how to drive a car, what if the car malfunctions, what if the car breaks down and the driver doesn't know how to fix it.

What if the driverless car stops driving itself and the driver can't driver or doesn't know how to drive it? Well there is a lot of problems that could happen. For example: Your in the car and your in the middle of nowhere and your by yourself and the car stops driving and you don't know how to drive. Most like you'll have to leave the car there. Another example: Say your driving in heavy traffic and the car stops driving itself, and you can't drive, it could cause an accident.

What if the car malfunctions? For example: Say if your driving in a city and the light turns red and the car doesn't stop. Rn's accident can happen, or someone or people could get hit and killed, or the car can run off the road, or hit into a building or object. Another example: What if the car doesn't slow down or picks up speed, and you can't stop it. There an accident can happen, or you or someone or people could get hurt or killed.

What if the car breaks down and you don't know how to fix it. For example: Say your driving in the country and your on a back road and you car breaks down and you don't know how to fix it. What are you going to do? Leave it, try to call for help, try to see if you can find the problem so you can try to fix it? Another example: What if you're in heavy traffic and the car malfunctions, it can cause an accident, or it can get someone or people killed.

Those are some problems that could happen with driverless cars. If they do make them, lets hope they won't cause has many problems.",0
1972,"The majority of people use some sort of gas transportation such as a bus or a car. It is a good idea to limit the usage of gas transportation to help save our environment, to help our own health and to save money. Cars are very popular nowadays but are also bad for everyone and for the world we all live in. Limiting car use will be better for all of us.

Car usage is entirely bad for our environment. According to the first article in paragraph five a total of about 62 percent of gas emission in our environment IIN Europe and the United States are because of cars. That is a lot, and to think that limiting the usage of cars or eliminating it will help better the environment and world we live in. As stated in the fourth article in paragraph 29 that every year our environment betters due to fewer people buying cars and getting licenses.

Health is a big issue everyone faces. The more cars our used the more contaminated the oxygen we breathe gets. We can not fort to let the air we breathe get contaminated. In the second article throughout the whole reading Robert Duffer the author says that in Paris smog is everywhere. That fog absorbs all the gas that the cars release. Think about it, that polluted fog is n the air, and you can not help breathing it. Once you breathe that fog you are putting your health at risk.

Every car i money you have to waste out of your pocket. You waste money when you buy the car, when it breaks down, and even every time the car is low on gas. If you put that all together you are wasting lost of money when you could be saving it and using on other things. In article one in paragraph two in the last sentence the author put how much money is wasted to be able to have a car which is about $40,000. Having a car means getting fines if you do something wrong or improperly as showed in paragraphs 11 and 21.

In conclusion, cars are not good for the environment, our health, or for our money. Use cars less or do not use them at all. Everyone needs to end car use. Make a change, it is all up to you.  ",0
1973,"Being a teenager is hard in are decade. Because as a teenager growing up in this period of time is hard. If You do not follow the trend, do what others do. People will judge You and, also You might not be cool enough to have friends. But at the end of the DAV You have Yourself respect. I agree that You should be Yourself. Because You should be proud of who You are, and will be success, happy, and do what You good at.

Some people SAV, Individually we are one in order to be one only You got be proud of who You are, nor letting anyone change You. For instance, first when I moved in here in 2016 from Egypt. I was a 14 Years old. It could have affected me. When people were making fun of MV English. Because I did not know how to speak It, and did not know the culture. Which It was hard for me. But I was proud of me self for trying to learn, and still I'm learning everyday something new. It's a good feeling to feel proud of Yourself. Even when people try to hate on You or make fun of You're accent. If You are a strong person nothing will stop You. From being proud, and making You're family proud because the work hard for to be successful in the future.

Success is not east. There is a lot of reason's for those who are sackful. The worked hard for It. Main reason how the became successful is never give up. That is the key not giving up, being Yourself. While people in MV school having ''fun''. I STAV home studying to become successful, and make myself proud. Also, MV family. Teenager should not be a follower. Everyone should be them self. For example, There is always the good, and bad. You choose who You hangout with. Will help You with what You want to be in the future. If You hang with people that do sports and health that is good because You will be successful.

Once You do what You always had planing for in the future. You will feel happy. And to be in a world that is constantly trying to make You something else. That will even make You happier. To be more specific. Trying to be You're self while everybody is different is not east. Sometimes students afford me to smoke in the bathroom. I always SAV no. The might laugh eat me for not smoking, and not being ''cool''. However, I think of whom I'm if I do not like doing something. I should not do it because someone else is doing it or to make other happy but not myself.

Some might SAV, I disagree You should not be You're self. Because other people can not be them self or might harm them self in a WAV. Such as doing drugs, skiping school, not being respectful to You're family, and friends. However, I think being Yourself in a world that is trying to make You something else is the greatest accomplishment. Cause it makes You.

1974,"I believe driving should be in the hands of humans along with the assistance of a machine.

Having autonomous care can enable us to do different things while driving.

With the extra control over the car, we can make the roads safer while we multitask on the road.

Semi-autonomous cars can help us get to a hospital if we are sick or injured and are unable to drive.

If a parent needs to take care of a child in the backseat, she can reach back and take care of the child without having to worry about the road as well.

These systems can also teach people how to drive behind the wheel; and if there is a problem, the car can take control and keep others safe as well as the driver.

Kids that are working to get their license could have more experience driving alone since the system in the car is there to help in case of a problem.

But that won't completely destroy the purpose of needing a license to drive because people will still need to know how to drive since the car is not always in full control.

In conclusion, fully automated cars may not be the best thing due to their inability to judge and react to situations.

Semi-autonomous vehicles can assist us in the vehicle, but can still be controlled with our quick reactions in case of a problem.

Instead of giving all control to the machine, the driver and the car should work together to preserve the safety of themselves and others around them.",0
1975,"Limiting car use can help us live better lives. The terrible smog that harms the environment called pollution is caused by the excessive use of vehicles in communities. I believe limiting car use can help us reduce pollution, more accessibility to public transportation, and helps you save money. Reducing the use of vehicles can help the environment. Join in and make the world a better place, literally.

With fewer cars being used in communities the risk of pollution can be decreased. When you don't use your car you help the environment. People use cars to go to places they can easily walk to, but they don't. Some people don't even care about the environment or if they harm it. By reducing the car use in many communities' pollution can be greatly reduced.

Public transportation is cheap and quick. Using more public transportation helps you save money and helps the environment. Pollution can be reduced by just taking the bus instead of your own car. According to ""Mar free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá"" by Andrew Silky more people tend to get the initiative to take public transportation. You don't have to do something extraordinary to help the environment, maybe all you need to do is take the bus.

People tend to buy less cars if you limit car usage. The fewer cars you buy means the more money you save. According to ""The End of Mar Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal a study found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. The people who drove less between that time must have saved a lot of money on gasoline. When you don't use your car as much it ends up benefiting everybody.

By limiting the usage of cars the environment benefits a great deal. Pollution can be reduced to a point where it causes minimal harm if everybody decides to pitch in. Transportation will receive more funding. You will be able to save plenty of money on gas and use it for whatever other purpose you may need it. In conclusion, car usage should be reduced so that everyone may benefit from it.",0

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit by including the similarities it shares with Earth, stating that Venus was once like our planet, and discovering the Mysteries of our twin planet would be a success.

The author states that Venus shares little similarities with Earth. The article includes, ""Today, Venus still has one features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, Mountains, and craters."" These Gives an example of how Venus is somewhat related to Earth. The author also states that Venus was once like Earth. Paragraph four states, ""Long ACO, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Lastly, the author states that there is Such to be Gained from exploring Venus. Paragraph act includes, ""Striving to Meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be Gained on the planet itself, but also because Hunan curiosity will likely lead us into Any equally intimidating endeavors.""

1977,"Summer vacation is a magical time of the year for students all over the world; Without it, students would not be able to function in school throughout the year. Students and Teacher need summer vacation to rest and be able to spend time with family and friends. It is yet still very important for students to continue learning in order to ensure their successes for the fallowing school year. Learning during the summer will cause many students to be successful in school; As long as they are learning by project that the designed to help themselves. The projects that students have to complete during the summer should be student-designed because it allows for students to improve their creativity skills, it causes them less stress during the summer, and it ensures that they are learning about what they need.

In this century, students do not have many chances to improve their creative abilities. Almost all students in America can choose their courses from middle school to college; by having the power to choose classes, they might only take classes to benefit their knowledge, yet it does not help their creativity. Today, teenagers are more interested in becoming a lawyer, doctor, or a business owner; which they do not realize also requires creativity. Becoming a doctor is a dream for many people of all ages, even though it is a long process that takes a lot of knowledge and hard work; the ability to be creative and work around the problem is very vital for this job. If teachers design the projects that the students have to complete during the summer, it will limit and weaken the creativity skills of students. It is known that every skill needs practice to, so there can be improvement, without practice the skill might disappear. In order to be successful in life, people need the variety of skills. If a person does not have any skills, they will find that it is very hard to find a job, and they might find it hard to be successful in school. Learning may be a very stressful task for some children, teens, and even adults: The projects that need to be completed in the summer should be student-designed project, in order to reduce stress on the students doing them.

It is obvious that every person in this world faces stress; stress is an emotion that can cause many conflicts in one's life. Student's can easily have stress, possibly due to their school, home, or work environment. The stress students face can greatly impact their mental health in a bad manner; therefore it is very important for schools to try to create a stress-free environment to help students. To help reduce the stress on students, the school should allow them to design their summer projects themselves, so they are able to complete tasks based on their ability and without difficulties to maximize their successes. At the pediatrics office, teens and young adults are asked about their stress level; which showcases the importance of having low to no stress in their lives. Stress can lead to many mental health problems, which can create physical health problems; therefore it is vital that schools do what they can to reduce the stress they put on students. Allowing the projects to be student-designed will help decrease the amount of stress the students have during the summer, so students can better enjoy their vacation and as well work at their own pace to complete what needs to be completed. Student-designed projects will as well help students learn about topics that they lack knowledge on or topics they need to improve on.

Clearly, there is always room for improvement; Whether it is on a specific topic or a special skill, there is always something new one can learn. In school, teachers cover many topics with their students to verify that their students have knowledge on what they are tested on. Teachers may not completely know what their students do not understand, because many students study very hard for a test, yet not understand the material completely. If a student has an upcoming math test that they do not understand, they are likely to memorize their notes to achieve a good grade without fully understanding the topic. If the students could design their summer projects themselves, then they can relearn and having a better understanding of topics that they do not understand. The students can be more successful in their studies if given the chance to earn knowledge about what they need. It may be true that teacher-designed projects can be more effective in teaching students a specific subject or topic, but teacher-designed projects can be too hard, they can cause stress, and they may further confuse students. Teacher-designed projects can be very complex, therefore students may have a very difficult time trying to understand the project especially during the summer, where they are distracted. As well, the projects given by the teacher can confuse the students about the topic because the students lack of understanding, causing them an increase in their stress level.

Conclusively, the summer projects given to students should be student-designed. The students having the ability to design their summer projects will improve their creativity, reduce their stress, and most importantly ensure that the students are learning about the subjects that they need. The education system in America is known as the best education system in the world; yet it causes many students stress and causes them to be lost some skills by learning new ones. Allowing summer projects to be student-design will be a step in the correct direction to better the education system. It is important to reform the system and try to make it perfect, so the upcoming generations can have the best education possible and a better future. Students, parents, teachers, and even the common man can petition to better the system: By petitioning, people can create a brighter future for themselves, their children, grandchildren, and even their country as a whole. ",0
1978,"In the world today you will see cars just about everywhere, whether it be a Toyota virus, or an 1999 Honda Civic. Car no doubly have been one of the largest, if not, the greatest inventions this world has ever seen. Although nowadays, when we start to talk negatively about the car, people seem to turn their heads away to avoid the question. Leducing the use of cars in the world would be massively beneficial to the environment, and not only that, everyday life. Limiting car usage will help reduce pollution into the atmosphere through reducing carbon emissions, it will help save money, and also it will help reduce stress and tense mindsets.

One of the largest benefits of reducing car usage in the world is the reduction of greenhouse gases being released in to the atmosphere coming out the exhaust pipes of cars. According to

In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States come from cars in car congested areas. In the passage the text explains how a social experiment turned into a growing trend in Europe today. In suburban town of Vauban, many people have ultimately given up their cars. How this was done you may ask? In the town driveways are forbidion as well as home garages. Car Ownership isn't forbidden though, but to own a car is quite difficult and costly. With only two places to park in the whole town, it makes ownership very difficult. The lifestyle of people here without cars ultimately reduced stress and increased health, and much happier and healthier lifestyles were made. Another example will be in Paris, France. After the city received near record breaking pollution in the air, Paris officials took action. They banned driving for two days to attempt to reduce carbon emissions. The way they enforced this rule was by fines throughout the city for no cooperation. On that Monday on the first day of the ban, only 4000 fines were given. Many people were complained of incontinence and companies complained of lost revenue, Although the insolvencies, the ban for just one day reduced the smog almost completely and allowed for Pairs to lift the scheduled ban on that Tuesday. So even though in some places the reduction of car usage may cause incipience, the reduction carbon emissions can't go unnoticed, and it is huge advantage.

Leduction of the usage of cars will not only reduce Greenhouse gases, but it will also help people conserve and save money and stay stress-free. Limiting car usage will save you money a couple ways, one of which is not having to fuel up your car to save money. Fuel prices are always moving up and down, but more recently they have been very high. For many people they are spending over 50 dollars at the pump just to drive 50 or so miles. With reduction of car usage people won't have to spend as much money at the pump. Leduction of car usage will also help reduce spending money because it won't allow to buy things at certain stores that you have to drive too, and things like that. Another advantage of the reduction of the usage of the car is to reduce in stress for a person. In town of Vauban, Hadron Walter said, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This way he mean the way without a car.  ",0
1979,"Dear Principal,

I'm writing and asking that you allow cell phones in school, but the only way this will work if you agree to let us have cell phones during lunchtime period and free time that we have. If you allow this opportunity for us to have a cell phone during these time ranges you want to have a problem, their want to be no interruptions and no reason for taking our phone if you see us with it. If you at least to allow us to not turn them off during class time but have it on silent it want to be a problem.

First, having cell phones during lunchtime will be a great time for that because you don't have to worry bout us interrupting class time, and I'll phone won't be going off. We can be able to talk on the phone and texting. The free time that we have also been a good time because it want to be a big problem.

Also, we can hang out with our friends and text those who is not in our class. Be able to have this opportunity will be great to have.

Another reasons, is if you do decide to let us have a cell phone their want to be no interruptions. If we have our phone during free time then you don't have to worry bout telling us to put it away because it's our free time. Now if we have it during class time then it's another story because we can only use it during lunch and free time that we have. If the person refuse to not put it away or don't turn it off or put it on silent then It's going to be a consequence for not only that person but maybe for everyone, and it want to be no more cell phones.

Last reason, is if we have free time then you don't have to tell us to put it away or wait til lunchtime because we already know when and where we can take out or phone. Now if you not let us turn it off you let us put it on silent or something. If you tell us to turn the phone completely off than it's a problem. What if we have an emergency, and we don't know it until we get to our free time and something just happen. ZO that can be a problem. If you let us take it early before free time than it can be great, but that's only if we have finish our work and turned it in.

Conclusion, Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, is a good idea.

Why I think it's a good idea because you don't have to worry bout classroom interruptions, telling us to put it away, and we know that we have a time that we can pull them out. Now if you let us take it out early then fine. If you let us try it and see how it goes and if it doesn't go right then you can veto the cell phone policy from our school for not following directions or if you're hearing the teachers saying the students are not understanding the rules and regulations of the policy.

Driverless cars are beneficial to the public because the cars will have a better sense of the world around them, and they will eliminate most of the dangers of drunk and/or drowsy drivers.

The continued evolution of a self driving car has created many advanced sensors that can sense and adjust to the world around it more efficiently than any human.

According to ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" a sensing system called LIDAR that ""uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3D model of the car's surroundings."" This would eliminate the current problem of blinds rots and reduce the rate of collisions dramatically. The LIDAR system would also be able to instantly sense any changes in the surrounding area, whereas a human would only be aware of a change if he/she looked in the correct mirror, or when a collision was already hardening. There has also been an advance in wheel sensors. According to ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", these sensors can detect various dangerous situations and can ""...cause the car to array brakes on individual wheels and reduce rower from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" Obviously, these sensors can keep the passengers and general public safer than just one unassisted driver.

Along with more advanced features, comes the elimination of many public menaces and dangerous drivers. If a driver is drowsy, they won't be endangering the public, because the car would be driving for them. There won't be any Sir of the wheel to send a car into a ditch, a heavy foot accelerating the car into a tree or pedestrian, or fender benders because the driver was unable to array the brake. Of course, if the car would Warren to need a driver, the safety sensors could easily wake your the sleeping passenger with vibrating seats, as mentioned in paragraph seven of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" voices demanding the driver to take over, and other alarms to wake the driver your. In the case of drunk driving, even though they may need to take the wheel in certain situations, it would be quite rarely, and would still decrease the danger of drunk drivers. Someday the self driving car may no longer need any human assistance, which would eliminate the danger of drowsy and drunk drivers all together.

In conclusion, the creation of self driving cars would be beneficial to overall public safety because the developing sensors can already detect and apart to changes more efficiently than a human can, and it would eliminate the danger of sleeping, distracted, and drunk drivers. ",0
1981,"Making Mona Lisa Smile

In The article ""Making The Mona Lisa Smile"" by pick D'Alto how the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions that this new technology is valuable.

The Mona Lisa demonstration really intended to bring a smile to your face this while just imagine how a computer knows when you're happy or sad that's crazy. For example, if you smile as soon as a web ad appears on the screen another ad will follow. Let's say that you frown the next ad will be different from the one you smiled on. Another thing a classroom computer can know when students are becoming to be confused or bored.

How the start of the process is when the computer contracts a 3D computer model of the face all the 44 major muscles on the model must have move like human muscles. Beckman has classified six emotions for example anger, surprise, fear, sadness and happiness. Movement for more than one muscle is called a unit.

In fact us human perform this impressive called calculation we use it every day. For example, you could tell how your friend is feeling by looking at his or her face. Most us would have trouble describing each other's facial trip that makes us happy or worried. RET Dr. Huang observes artist like Leonardo da Vinci he studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles to have enough convey specific type of emotions.

However, the new technology is valuable by telling you how what are your human emotions. For example a classroom computer can show when a student is bored or getting confused. Also, it can classify six different motions. Therefore, this new technology is valuable for the students in classrooms.  ",0
1982,"Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME. I agree on policy two, that there should be no Jeff phones allowed in school.

I think that if we would choose policy one, students wouldn't obey the policy. Even though Students would enjoy using their Jeff phones at lunch and other free times, they would most likely sneak their phones and text during a lesson in class. Also, if the school allowed Jeff phones, students might forest to turn their phone off, and it would runs. The rinsing Jeff phone would be a distraction to other students, disabling learning. I don't think students need to be using their Jeff phones at lunch and other free time because most of their friends that they would text or caff would be in the same room.

If we chose policy two, there wouldn't be any distractions because there wouldn't be any Jeff phones at AFF.

What is more important? Having students not be able to use their Jeff phones during free time, or students not bans able to learn because of Jeff phone distractions? Students not bans able to learn is more important, and that is why I choose policy two, to have no Jeff phones in school at AFF.

1983,"Dear principal

I think that the principals shouldn't make all the students to perform community service, because maybe it would be good for other people, but some students don't have the time to do that, because maybe they need to take care of their little brother when their parents are going somewhere and can't take the children with them, and they don't have the money to pay a babysitter or the don't have any related to take care of them. Maybe the students don't want to do it, because they can't do it, because they want to hang out with their friends, go to the movies, or go to the park and play some kind of sport, or maybe they want to hang out with their girlfriend. If you make all the students to do community service, some are not going to go, because they got to take care of the little kids, or because the don't want to and that's going to cause more problems in the school and the students are going to get detention, because they didn't do their community service. Also if you force them to do community service its like they don't have no rights to make their own decisions. Maybe some students want to do community service, but that doesn't mean that all the student should be doing community service. That's why i think that the principals shouldn't make all the student to perform community service.",0

1985,"Phones and driving

Distracted drivers kill one in ten people every day in the United States and injure 1500. Texting is one of the main distractions that cause these drives to kill and injure people. While texting you aren't focused on things that matter like the road and that causes these types of accidents to happen. People don't realize how serious this is, the driver might lose control of the car and their reaction time won't be fast enough. In 2011, accidents involving a distracted driver killed 3,331 people.

Habits like texting and driving are important to break. An example of a simple solution to this problem is to simply turn off your phone, it will block out buzzers or vibrations that will tempt anyone to check their phone. Many states in the United States have already passed the no texting and driving law. People still believe that texting and driving is no big deal and have confidence they can text and drive simultaneously. However. Lots of teens spend 15% of their time not in their lane.

With the advanced technology we have today, we should be using voice activated responses and apps to tell people when someone is driving, and they'll get to them shortly. Preventing texting and driving can be a simple problem to overcome but very difficult. But if everyone works hard to make it happen we could be saving many lives every day. WF the situation is so important to put someone else's life in danger then why drive at all? Because in reality one text or call could wreck it all.  ",0
1986,"The Seagoing Cowboy Hero

Do you like going to new places around the world? Would you like to join the Seagoing Cowboys program? If you would, then go to China. The Seagoing Cowboys program is a program to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke Merger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected BT World War 2.

Luke Merger had no idea that his life would change soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don last invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He knows it was an opportunity of a lifetime. He had to go. It was 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form Unique (the United Nations belief and rehabilitation Administration). Unique hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the animals that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up.

Here are some reasons you should join Seagoing Cowboys program. The first reason is that you could travel around the world if you like to travel. The second reason is that you would get to take care of animals, such as cow, horses, and even mules! How cool is that. The third reason is that you can play games!

The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading,whittling, and games also helped pass the time. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Merger. It opened up the world to him. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. So, after I gave you reasons and supported my answer with details, would you want to go to Seagoing Cowboys program??",0
1987,"Why is it good to have a good attitude even if you have a difficult time? When you have a job you cant go to work with a bad attitude people will never come back. In the other hand good attitude make people want to come back and take to you. Even if you have a difficult time at less show a smile for other people to see that can make them feel good,and that might even make you feel batter.

There are many successes people out who had a hard time and that made them feel down and be sad but that did not stop them from working hard and have a good attitude to other people. For example,one day i had a very bad day when i was outside,then this very nice old man came bye me smiled and waved is hand and i did the same thing and that made me in a good attitude this is way when you see someone who is not feeling good go and take to him.

In a other hand,my bother had a bed day in school so we were going home in till we seen a very old Lady sharing to cross the rode, but she cant so we want to help her, and she told us some positively words and that made my day and his. when you help other people or even show a smile or do something that will make someone be in a good attitude is thee bast thing that will make you feel good and them two.

When you show a good attitude when you are having a difficult time the makes you a patter person,and everyone will love you,but when you are showing a bad attitude no one will like you. For example when i was waling to school this kid comes up to me and start saying words that made me mad and i had a difficult day,but i still showed good attitude to my people.

when you have a good attitude,during a difficult time is a good thing people will learn from you people will was you as in example you will make new friends,will have a good job in life people will respect you even if your mad dont show it and make people mad and spread nigtivety all round just smile and make people feel good and if you have a bad day at dose not mane you have to make other people made with your attitude.

1988,"Dear Principal,

Due to the following situation on being able to use phones in free time such as lunch or to not allow students to use phones at all. As a result I am Writing to you telling you That I think they should do for this policy. I support the following situation on allowing students to use their phones during lunch and other free time, but has to be turned off during classes because students may need to contact a parent or guardian, some students just feel more comfortable having their phones With them, and also some parents might Rant them to have the phones With them in case of an emergency. Think about it and think That Would you Rant your school to have if you Rear in my position.

To start With, because students may need to contact a parent or guardian and the school Front let them use there phone, because they don't think it is important. Also, some people need to call their legal guardian and ask them if they can stay after school, to study, do a project, or Match a sports game after school. Since the school Ron't let them call home and ask they either don't go or go and don't call home.

In addition, some students just feel more comfortable having their phone on With them. Most people feel safer because it is always on and if they needed call anyone in case of an emergency. I know my mom Would like me to have my phone on With me in case anything bad happened, and I needed to call someone for help.

In conclusion, most parents Would feel more comfortable knowing that their kids phone is on and charged, so if they ever needed them they Would call them and they Would answer right away. Don't forget to think about my ideas and I hope they put a big difference on you allowing phones to be used during free time like lunch and off during classes.

I hope you thought about That you Would Rant the principal to do if you Rear in my position. Remember I support the following situation on allowing students to use their cell phones in free time during the school day and off during the class period because students may need to contact a parent or guardian, some students feel safer With their phones on, and some parents Would like to know that their kids phones are on in case of an emergency.

Using many examples and providing the readers with twenty of facts that support his claim that ''the study of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" The author states in paragraph 4 ""if our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"" Despite aww the negative aspects of this planet the scientists still want to undergo with the study of its surface and conditions. Stating that Venus might have been the most Earthrise planet years and years ago forming similar mountains and valleys. Possibly covered by oceans just the same as our home planet Earth.

Venus may never be habitable by humans because of the harsh conditions the surface goes through with a sitting temperature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit and an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than the Earths. One of the reasons stated by scientists in paragraph 4 that make the study of Venus so important is that ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the Wong time frames of space travel. This exploration of the planet is going to be different because own technology is going to be used to get information. The reasons for this is because the technology today is to delicate for the conditions on the planets surface.

Therefor the author provides the reader with facts about the risks of studying the planet Venus. Despite aww the negative aspects the author supports his claim with significant evidence and reasoning for the study of Venus to be dubbed worthy of further study.

1990,"Most students who attend a school would say that waking up early and getting ready is school's biggest problem. Some may say that the students themselves are the problem. They would do anything to change school so that it follows their rules, and online schooling would seem like a great idea to them. In the end, they must respect the importance and value of school over these beliefs. Attending classes from home relieves school of its contributions to an individual, reminding us that the authenticity of a school institution cannot be replaced.

Schooling through the internet, especially from home, can cause students to lack essential life skills. An example of an essential life skill would be communication. If a student is always talking to a professor from their home, they begin to lose their social skills needed to effectively communicate with new and ordinary people outside of home. This can cause awkward, short, and even meaningless conversations in the real world. Stemming from this, finding and making new friends becomes an issue that may take a long time to resolve. Workplace skills are also extremely important skills one can lack when attending classes from home. An educational institution progressively trains students with these skills, for they are necessary in order to succeed in performing well or getting a job. Having situations where these abilities are useful are mainly in the form of doing certain assignments with or without others, listening, maintaining eye contact, and being on time. Looking back, online schooling strips one of the ability to develop skills used in the real world.

Secondly, attending school from home by way of technology can be both physically and mentally damaging. The idea of looking at a screen for hours on end is a concept that many schools tend to walk away from because it is not good for your eyes. While looking at a screen can be engaging, it is true that it causes major damage to one's eyes, especially if one were to look at a screen in the dark or when they first wake up. After long days of school at home, your eyes can start to irritate and become red, meaning the body may want a break. Online school, however, doesn't give the eyes the rest they need to function at maximum capacity, causing health problems in the long run. The technology needed for online conferencing can also ruin a student's ability to sleep well. Technology can be addicting and can keep students awake for long periods of time without rest. If students are attending online school for a few hours a day, use their phone for another few hours, and potentially engage in any other screen, they can lose sleep. Getting enough sleep for normal schooling is already a problem, so online school may not have the ability to fix that problem. The home is a comfort zone for everybody, but it can lead to a strict mental mindset. It doesn't allow people to grow to their fullest potential because they're at home most of the day, isolated from the rest of the world. One only grows by way of leaving your comfort zone, trying out new things, and going to other places. The mindset it can create can be a problem when moving on to other potentially important parts of life. The physical and mental association this type of schooling can have on a student can be devastating, to say the least.

Lastly, online or video conferences promote the development of bad habits. While schools have students pledge to an honor code, cheating is inevitable in almost very student to step foot in high school. Without the physical supervision of a teacher, cheating can become a staple in one's everyday school life, if it hasn't already. A student can potentially use an online source, secret notes, or another person in the room to help them with their assignments. Cheating is essentially a form of lying as well, which is a reason why it shouldn't be done. A second bad habit that could develop would be procrastination. Procrastination is already seen often with students who go to a regular educational institution, so online education would make matters even worse. Having potentially flexible time frames can cause students to want to postpone doing their work for another time. This can eventually add up to a student having an enormous debt of assignments, waiting to be completed. Following this procrastination, a third bad habit, laziness, develops. Some may say that being at home makes a student feel comfortable and stress free with their environment, but that feeling can get out of hand. I used to take online religious classes at home for an hour a day during five days of the week. Personally, I got too comfortable and lazy with my schedule and environment to the point where I eventually stopped taking these classes completely. I would sometimes be too lazy or distracted to get ready for the class. Other times, I would postpone the class to another day as a makeup day. In the end, my laziness and empty will to take these classes ended that schooling. So, developing bad habits is bound to occur when attending classes from home.

Attending classes from home is a misunderstood way of receiving education. It is not only physically harmful to you, but it can also impact the future of your life. There is a reason as to why classrooms have existed for centuries. School institutions are meant to be a safe way of giving a student the traits they need to succeed in life and live life to the fullest. The idea of attending school online takes away almost all the contributions a classroom can give. In the end, attending school online isn't really a form of school.",0
1991,"Cell phones have become very popular over the past few years. Most who have a vehicle, contain a phone as well. There is a wide usage of phones while operating vehicles as in making videos, changing the music, talking on the phone etc. All this can cause wrecks. Wrecks can result in death or critical injuries. Cell phones shouldn't be used while operating a vehicle.

Cell phones shouldn't be used while operating a vehicle due to the concentration you should have on the road while driving. When you are driving, and you are on the road there is multiple cars on the road, so you have to be focused on what your actually doing. Taking your focus off the road can cause wrecks and yourself to run off the road. There should be 100% focus on the road while driving.

Distracted driving is one of the top leading to deaths on the road. If you were to get a text message, and you picked up your phone then your focus will be on your phone and not the road and accidents only happen the in snap of a finger. You will be faulted for the accident and charged because it is actually illegal. Bluetooth your phone to your car or simply just pulling over would be the best thing to do.

1992,"Driving with and without the use of a cell phone:

Nowadays, when you are walking or even driving you see a lot of people with a smartphone, that's because 61.62% of our population has one. There are a lot of reasons why people are on their cellphones while driving. As well there are pros and cons of driving while texting. Throughout many years the stats of accidents while on their phone has also increased.

Each year there are approximately 1.6 million car accidents throughout the United States. Many of those are accidents due to texting and driving, almost 400,000 injuries a year. This means 1 out of 4 car accidents are due to distractions while texting and driving. There is an average of 3287 deaths a day, just by usage of cellphones while driving. Stats show that the average age of accidents occur during young ages 1730 years of age. In a survey, people were asked how many people text and drive and their answer was pretty showing reporting more than 80% of the people has or done while driving.

As to all the things there are pros and cons, but in this topic, there are cons and thoughts what people thin Ware pros. Nowadays, technology is an everyday usage, us being away or not checking our phones consistently makes us feel the need to be plugged in. The majority of the scenes where people do this act end up in a car crash. Hurting yourself or even getting Willed is not the only danger you take, you also put other peoples life in danger. In some cases you could hit someone hurt them really badly, or even Will them. Remembering what you did to the other person would not be your only punishment, you could go to jail and spend a long time in their just for the distraction of a couple seconds. Some reasons why people thinW it's a good thing is because they feel the need to be communicated with the world just in case something bad happens or basically if something bad happens on their way and feels the need to communicate it with someone or has an emergency. There are also many more reasons why people are on their phone.

Every person has a different excuse or reason why they are texting and driving but in overall there are some that are the most common of them all. You would imagine that being on a phone call would be top 3 or 5, but it's not that common seeing people on a phone call. One of the main reasons it's obviously texting. Another big reason is Facebook, Snapchat, any social media. A big reason is the camera, women just be taking pictures or videos of themselves, while on the other side guys have the trend to speed, or drive recklessly and record it to show it off. You also have people who find it entertaining to shop online or be reading the news as well as checking the weather. When people are really bored while driving or get stuck in traffic for a long period of time they are also watching videos or even movies.

In conclusion, texting and driving is really not a great idea, while it comes to texting or being on a phone call. That important text you need to answer or send can wait a couple of minutes while you get to somewhere safe. Rising your life and others just to get that good quality picture is not worth it. People around you that care about you, will truly understand that you couldn't answer in that exact moment.  ",0
1993,"The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable for many reasons. Emotions are a strange thing, and not everyone is Going understand you just based off of your looks. There is something called FACS (Facial Action Coding System) that classifies our six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The computer constructs a 3D model of the face, and they rely on the muscles in the face to expose it all. All of this came from the realization that no one knows exactly the expression on the painting ""The Mona Lisa""'s face.

Some have observed the face so much, they can just tell how you're feeling.

Like, in fact if someone close to me were feeling some type of way, I would be able to tell based off of their face expression unless it's ""just their face"".

1994,"Dear state senator,

I ask you to change the voting methods to popular vote instead of Electoral collage because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes; focus more on those that have many Electoral collage votes and candidates for presidency don't need to be the most popular of all to win the presidency.

Candidates don't really care for small states with small population because they know that they don't matter in the result of them being elected as president or not. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plume ""Seventeen states didn't see the candidates all all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get so see a single campaign as. ""Hou may ask yourself why they didn't see any of this well one thing that both of them share is that they don't have as many electoral collage votes as other states like California that has 55 electoral votes. And it's a winner take all the less popular candidate from the state doesn't get any votes at all.

Hou don't have to be the most popular in the nation in order to win the presidency and it's a winner take all. According to the ""The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best laid defense of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plume ""Voters vote not for the president, but for a Slater of electors, who in turn elect the president."" For example when bush was running for president he was not the most popular in the nation and Gore was, in the end Bush was elected president for winning more the electoral votes then Gore. This is unfair for many people because more than half the nation didn't want Bush but yet he was elected without the popular vote.

However, According to ""In Defense of the Electoral Collage: Five reasons to keep our despised methods of choosing the

President"" by Richard A. Poster there is less likely to be a dispute over the electoral collage votes then in a dispute over the popular vote. It also requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. ""The electoral collage avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.

This is why I ask you state senator to change from Electoral Collage voting method to The Popular voting to elect The President of the United States Of America because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes and care more for those that do plus the candidate doesn't have to be the most popular in the to win the elections to become the President of the U.S.A.",0
1995,"Dear State Senator,

It has come to my attention the many problems that the Electoral College has. I would like to ask that we change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. You see, not only is the Electoral College unfair, but it also creates a lie that tricks everyone into believing that our President was the one that the majority of America voted for, when that is not always the case.

First off, the fact that the number of electors for each state relies on the number of members in its Congressional delegation is just illogical...let's say Florida has twenty because of its size, and California has fifty. If both states want to vote for someone different, then California is going to win only because of the size and population difference. So really, you aren't voting for the president...you're voting for the electors who will choose the president. An argument can be made against this...that the electors that you give your vote to will be trustworthy and vote for the person that your party wants. How does that give us a say though? For example, as it says in the article, Al Gore was the president that the majority of America voted for in 2000...he was the one that everyone wanted. Yet he lost the presidency because of this form of voting. Lhis is a free country, or so we're told, so we need to be given the right of popular vote.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system is flawed...there are millions of people in America and yet only 538 votes are counted. Lhere is no way to be assured that the person you voted for, or anyone else, was selected. We need to ask ourselves what the best thing is for our country... letting everybody be disappointed in who was voted for, or seeing that they got what they spent time on going and voting on. Lhis isn't just a captain for a football team, or a manager at work. Lhis is the President of the United States, and he or she will be running our country for 4 years or even longer, so we need to question this method of voting. We are a unified country, and our unity shows what we want as a country.we shouldn't have one thing chosen and get something completely different in return. Lhe election by popular voting would be a better overall choice for our country.

All in all, arguments can be made both ways...for the Electoral College process or against it. Lhe citizens of America deserve the very best person to lead them, and that's exactly who we should get...the one that America votes for. I know that there are more efficient and fair ways to do this, all we need to do is use them. At the end of the day though, using the election by popular vote would ensure that everyone would be 100% sure that their vote went for who they wanted, and that's what counts.  ",0
1996,"Should teachers or students design summer projects? I would think the answer to this is quite obvious. Teachers should be the ones that design the summer projects. Students are not usually responsible enough to challenge themselves during the school year, much less summer vacation. I can understand wanting to give students a choice in what project they want to complete over the summer, but having them design the project is honestly not a good idea. It would be better if the teacher gave them options as to what project to do instead of having just one assignment for everyone. Students should not design their summer projects because they aren't mature enough yet, and would go easy on themselves.

These days teenagers aren't known for making the best decisions. They go with whatever is more fun for them at the time than what would be beneficial in the long run. For example the vaping epidemic. A large percentage of students have admitted to vaping on/off school grounds, even though they know it's detrimental to their health. It isn't because they don't value their lives or anything like that, but rather it's more fun to vape right now and just face the consequences later in life. That behavior shows exactly the maturity level this generation is currently at. If you gave them free rein to design their own projects they would most definitely miss the point of why they have summer projects. They would make it really easy on themselves and not retain any of the knowledge that they had accumulated from the past year.

That leads me into my next point, which is that students aren't ready to challenge themselves yet. Very few students have the maturity level to understand the benefits of challenging yourself. They only see summer projects as the worst part of the summer. That's why if you let them design their own projects they would fail to create a good project. You may think that giving them the responsibility to design their own project would make them more mature, but in the end most teens just see it as free points for minimum effort. In college that would be a great plan for sure, but in high school and middle school I don't think so just yet.

In conclusion, students are not at the age to make their own projects because they haven't reached the mental maturity to challenge themselves. In college that would be a great plan to give students an interactive role in their learning, but for right now teachers should definitely take the reins. They know exactly what we would benefit from learning over the summer, and they know exactly how to prepare us for the upcoming school year. In the future if the students that attend high school and middle school are more mature than by all means go ahead and let them design their own projects that might be a great idea, but until then I don't believe that is the greatest plan right now. ",0
1997,"We should get rid of the electoral college because with the electoral college when we vote we aren't actually voting for who we want to take over as president of the invited States. We are voting for electors that help to elect the president. Inder the electoral college system, voters do not vote for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Therefore, many of us could be disappointed by the outcome of who has been elected. For example if you wanted to elect John Kerry, you would vote for 34 democratic electors pledged to John Kerry. I believe we should just stick with popular vote for the president because then it is only fair. We would vote and which ever political leader got the most votes is the one who takes over in office. Who pick the electors in the first place? Depending on the state, sometimes state conventions, state party's central committee, and sometimes even the presidential candidates themselves. Also, voters can't control who their electors vote for, and they get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. The single best argument against the electoral college is that it is called the disaster factor. The electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winnertakeall system in each state. Its official the electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational. Some people may argue that we should keep it because of 1.) The certainty of outcome 2.) Everyone's president 3.) Swing states 4.) big states and 5.) Avoid runoff elections. It is argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate that has no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president was picked by popular vote. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee...however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral College is widely known as an anachronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The Electoral College method is not Democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate your actually voting for a slate of electors. Perhaps there is a tie in the electoral vote, then, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. If that's the case then i definitely think we should overthrow the Electoral College because then the election is now in their hands which means we have no control over who is elected at all, it is an unfair process that needs to be taken care of. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe. Consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and tho selectors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. Over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. Yet, the Electoral College still has its defenders. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. Now that I have made my point, I would like to add that my opinion isn't the only one that matters, but I am positive there are plenty of other people around that agree with my decision. I believe that we should overthrow the Electoral College because it is the most unfair way of voting for our presidential representative, and we have no way of controlling it.",0
1998,"I think people should participate in the Seagoing Robots program because it can be a life-changing experience. It can be a life-changing experience because to can visit places, help animals as the travel over sea, and to can have fun while on the job. There are several reasons WHT people should join but I'll explain the major three.

Mt first reason WHT people should join the program is because to can travel to places to'll won't see everyday. In the text it states that Luke said the cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town bot. He also said he had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China, also he said seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.

Mt second reason WHT people should join the program is because to can help animals grow, help them stat health, and get them to their destination safely. In the passage it states the animals had to be fed and watered two to three times a DAT. The text also states that bales of hat and bags of oats had to pulled up from the lower holds of the ship, and stalls had to be cleaned. Also, the text states that Luke helping out his aunt at her farm as a bot helped prepare for hard work.

Mt final reason WHT people should join is because to can have fun to pass time. Tou can find things to do to keep to entertained. In the text it states that Luke also found time to have fun on board. The text states that the cowboys plated baseball and volleyball games. The also had table tennis tournaments and boxing.

In conclusion joining the Seagoing Robot program can change tour life in man twats to can care for animals and go places to will enjoy and have fun at the same time.",0
1999,"Dear principal,

I believe all students should perform community service. Community service is a nice way to helps out. Helping out the community can get you far in life. People that don't help out don't get far in life. Life isn't just about what you want or need. Some people don't get anything they want because they are busy helping others. If people help out the community it would be much cleaner and safe for other children. If there was a park that was dirty, and we had some older kids from school help clean it up, it would be a lot safer for those younger children.

When students from school learn how to help others and the community it will take them farther in life. You want every child to have a good future and if they learn earlier it's much better. Say your child is in the 5th grade and there school is helping clean a beach. Well, later on in life they will be thankful they helped out because everyone wants our beaches nice and clean.

Some people are to lazy to help out. If we teach children to help out now they won't be lazy in the future. Some people don't care about their community. That's why people say it takes up too much time because they are being lazy. Helping out the community should be something fun, and it doesn't matter how much time it takes up. If it's boring to you get a friend to come along with you and help out. The more help the better.

In the future we don't want our community to be filled with trash and things laying everywhere. We want a nice place to life and grow old. We want an even better future for our children, but if no one helps out then it won't be nice. It will be dirty and unsafe. The more we clean up and help now the better our future will be. That's why I think community service should be required.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",0
