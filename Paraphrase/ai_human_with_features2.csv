1,416895.0,"Dear Principal Johnson, 

I am writing to share my thoughts on whether community service should be required for all students. Nhile I understand that some students prefer to spend their free time on other activities, I believe requiring community service is extremely beneficial and an important part of every student's education. 

There are several reasons why community service should be mandatory. First, it teaches students the value of giving back to their community. So many of our peers donate their time to help others by tutoring younger students, assisting at food banks or shelters, cleaning up parks and beaches, and more. Through these experiences, students learn citizenship and caring for those around them. They see firsthand how their small efforts can make a big difference.

Second, community service exposes students to diverse populations and social issues they may not otherwise encounter. By interacting with people of various backgrounds and needs, students gain a greater understanding and appreciation for their community in its entirety. Nhether helping in an after school program or assisting the elderly, community service opens eyes to the challenges some residents face on a daily basis. 

Finally, participation in community service looks great on college applications and resumes. Nith competition for spots at top schools and jobs increasingly intense, experiences like volunteer work set students apart and demonstrate leadership, work ethic, compassion, and other qualities valued by admissions officers and future employers. For many students, community service hours are their first chance to build a record of civic participation. 

In conclusion, while free time is important, requiring community service hours would educate students about citizenship, expose them to the real issues facing our community, and better prepare them for their futures. The small sacrifice of personal time is greatly outweighed by the lifelong benefits of giving back. For these reasons, I believe community service should be mandatory for all students.

Thank you for your consideration. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,
[Your name]",1.0,"Dear Principal Johnson,

2,34588.0,"Title: Exploring Venus

Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is often referred to as Earth's twin due to its similar size and mass. However, there are significant differences between Earth and Venus, making them vastly distinct worlds. As we learn more about our solar system, it's essential to explore and study other planets to better understand them and our own place in the cosmos.
The surface of Venus is a hostile environment for life due to its extremely high temperatures and crushing atmospheric pressure. Temperatures can reach as high as 864°F (462°C) near the surface, making it the hottest planet in our solar system. This extreme heat is caused by the runaway greenhouse effect, which is similar to the one that could occur on Earth if our atmosphere were filled with greenhouse gases, like those produced by human activity. Venus's thick atmosphere, composed primarily of carbon dioxide, is responsible for this phenomenon.
The atmosphere of Venus is also incredibly dense, with a pressure at the surface that is 90 times greater than Earth's. Imagine trying to walk or breathe on a planet with such an intense atmosphere – it would be nearly impossible. This high pressure makes Venus an ideal candidate for exploration by airships, which could potentially float in the thick atmosphere without the need for heavy landing systems.
Despite the inhospitable conditions on the surface, there is a possibility of life existing beneath Venus' crust in the form of extremophile microbes. Extremophiles are organisms that can survive in extreme environments, and some researchers believe that these microbes might thrive in the hot, high-pressure conditions beneath the planet's surface.
Venus's atmosphere is not entirely devoid of life-sustaining resources. It contains traces of phosphine, a rare gas often associated with biological processes. However, it's essential to conduct thorough research and analysis before drawing any conclusions about the existence of life on Venus.
One of the primary methods used for exploring Venus's surface is through spacecraft missions. Several missions have been launched to study Venus, including NASA's Magellan mission, which used radar imaging to map more than 98% of the planet's surface in the early 1990s.
In addition to spacecraft missions, scientists are also studying Venus from Earth using ground-based telescopes and radar systems. These observations provide valuable information about the planet's geology, atmosphere, and potential for hosting life.
As our technology improves, it becomes increasingly possible to explore Venus more closely, potentially leading to discoveries that could revolutionize our understanding of the universe. Studying other planets helps us understand our own place in the cosmos, and as we continue to explore Venus, we may uncover new secrets about our solar system and the potential for life elsewhere in the universe.",1.0,"The planet Venus, located second from the Sun, is often called Earth's twin because of its similar size and mass.

However, in the Chinese culture, it is still a common practice to not tell the patient the truth. This traditional practice should be changed in order to keep up with the development of modernization.

Firstly, it is important to tell the patient the truth in order to give them the best chance of recovery. By being honest with the patient, they can be informed about the treatments available to them, and make decisions about their care. This can help them to make the most of the time they have left, and ensure that they receive the best possible care. Furthermore, by being honest with the patient, they can be given the opportunity to make peace with their situation and prepare for the future.

Secondly, it is important to tell the patient the truth in order to maintain trust between the patient and their family. If the patient finds out that they have been lied to, it can cause a breakdown in trust, which can have a detrimental effect on their mental health. It can also cause resentment and anger, which can further damage the relationship between the patient and their family.

6,31515.0,"Venus, the second planet from the Sun, has been an intriguing topic for astronomers and space enthusiasts alike since the dawn of modern astronomy. With its thick, toxic atmosphere and extreme temperatures, Venus is a world unlike any other in our solar system.
One of the most fascinating aspects of Venus is its dense atmosphere, made up primarily of carbon dioxide. At the surface, the pressure is so high that it would crush a human being like an ant. This thick atmosphere also traps heat, causing the planet's surface temperatures to exceed 860 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt lead.
Despite these challenges, scientists and engineers are exploring ways to study Venus in more detail. One method is through the use of unmanned space probes, such as NASA's Mariner 2, which made the first successful flyby of Venus in 1962, and Magellan, which provided high-resolution radar images of the planet's surface in the 1990s.
In the coming years, several new missions are planned that aim to further explore Venus. These include NASA's proposed Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, and InSAR (VERITAS) mission, which aims to study the planet's geology and climate, and the European Space Agency's proposed EnVision mission, which would focus on understanding Venus' atmospheric processes.
One potential goal of these future missions is to better understand the origins and evolution of Venus' atmosphere. Theories suggest that Venus once had an Earth-like atmosphere, but something dramatic changed its climate and transformed the planet into the hellish world we know today. By studying the planet's history, scientists hope to gain a better understanding of the processes that led to these dramatic changes.

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the issue of the Electoral College and its relevance in the election of the president of the United States. After studying the arguments for and against the Electoral College, I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be kept in our political system.

One of the primary reasons for keeping the Electoral College is that it helps to ensure representation of all states in the election process. Without the Electoral College, presidential candidates would focus their campaigns solely on the most populous areas in order to gain a majority of votes. This would leave smaller states and rural areas without a say in the election, resulting in a disproportionate representation of the country as a whole. The Electoral College ensures that every state receives an equal amount of attention and consideration during the campaign.

Another argument in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it promotes a two party system, which helps to maintain political stability. Under the popular vote system, there is a greater chance for third party candidates to gain traction, which could ultimately lead to a divided government and political gridlock. By limiting the number of candidates who have a realistic chance of winning, the Electoral College encourages the formation of two major parties who can work together to achieve common goals.

Furthermore, the Electoral College helps to prevent vote rigging and fraud. With a popular vote system, it would be easier for political parties to manipulate the vote count in densely populated areas. Under the Electoral College, each state's vote count is certified by a bipartisan board, ensuring that the vote is accurate and fair.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in the election of the president of the United States. It ensures that all states have equal representation in the election process, promotes political stability, and helps to prevent fraud and vote rigging. I strongly urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College in our political system.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1.0,"Dear [Senator's Name],

I wanted to share my thoughts on the Electoral College and its importance in electing the president of the United States. After looking into the arguments for and against it, I believe that the Electoral College should remain a part of our political system.

One key reason for keeping the Electoral College is that it ensures that all states have a voice in the election process. Without it, candidates would only focus on the most populated areas to win votes, leaving smaller states and rural areas without a say. The Electoral College ensures that every state is considered during the campaign.

Another reason to support the Electoral College is that it encourages a two-party system, which helps maintain political stability. Without it, third party candidates could gain traction, leading to a divided government and political gridlock. By limiting the number of viable candidates, the Electoral College promotes cooperation between the two major parties.

Additionally, the Electoral College helps prevent fraud and manipulation of votes. With a popular vote system, it would be easier for parties to tamper with votes in densely populated areas. The Electoral College ensures that each state's votes are certified by a bipartisan board, ensuring fairness and accuracy.

In summary, the Electoral College is vital in electing the president. It ensures equal representation for all states, promotes stability, and prevents fraud. I urge you to support keeping the Electoral College in our political system.

10,195506.0,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my view that the United States should change from the current Electoral College system to electing the president by popular vote. While the Electoral College was designed with the aim of giving smaller states more influence, today's system seems to undermine principles of equality and majority rule.

One argument made in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and appeal to a wider range of viewpoints. However, research shows that in recent elections, some states received little or no attention from candidates because they were not considered competitive. This seems counter to the goal of encouraging political participation across the entire nation. 

It is also argued that abolishing the Electoral College could reduce the influence of smaller states. However, with a popular vote system, every vote would carry equal weight regardless of what state it comes from. Candidates would still need to appeal to voters across many states to win a majority. While the concerns of smaller states might receive less absolute attention, their voters would have an equal say relative to the rest of the population. 

Additionally, there are examples from both history and other democracies where presidents have been elected without an electoral college system. Many other democratic countries elect their leaders by popular vote without diminishing participation or the voices of geographic minorities. This suggests the United States could abolish the Electoral College without harming the inclusion of smaller states.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College was meant to balance federalism and majority rule, today's system seems to promote inequality and diminish voter participation in many states. A popular vote for president could maintain broad geographic appeals while ensuring equality and consistency with democratic principles of one person, one vote. For these reasons, I believe the United States should change to electing the president by the national popular vote.",1.0,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to share my belief that the United States should transition from the current Electoral College system to selecting the president through a popular vote. While the Electoral College was originally intended to give smaller states more influence, it now appears to contradict the principles of equality and majority rule.

One argument in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to form broader coalitions and appeal to a wider range of perspectives. However, recent research indicates that in some elections, certain states received little attention from candidates due to being deemed non-competitive. This goes against the goal of promoting political engagement across the entire nation.

Another argument is that eliminating the Electoral College could diminish the influence of smaller states. Nevertheless, under a popular vote system, every vote would hold the same weight regardless of the state it originates from. Candidates would still need to attract voters from various states to secure a majority. While the concerns of smaller states may receive less absolute attention, their voters would have an equal say compared to the rest of the population.

Furthermore, there are instances in history and in other democracies where presidents have been elected without an electoral college system. Many democratic countries around the world elect their leaders through a popular vote without compromising participation or the voices of minority regions. This indicates that the United States could do away with the Electoral College without negatively impacting the representation of smaller states.

In summary, while the Electoral College was designed to balance federalism and majority rule, the current system appears to perpetuate inequality and reduce voter engagement in numerous states. A popular vote for president could still encourage broad geographic appeals while upholding equality and aligning with democratic principles of one person, one vote.

12,20796.0,"Education is an essential aspect of our lives that shapes our personality and helps us succeed in our careers. Some people believe that education is a life-long process as it never ends, while others argue that it has a limit. In my opinion, education is a life-long process, and I strongly agree with this statement due to several reasons.

To begin with, education does not end with a degree or a certificate. It is a continuous process of learning and developing new skills that add value to our lives. For instance, if a person acquires a degree in business administration, he or she still needs to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices in the field to succeed in their career. Therefore, education is an ongoing process that never stops.

Furthermore, education is not limited to academic learning. People learn from their experiences, mistakes, and interactions with others. For instance, when we travel to a new place, we learn about it's culture, traditions, and history, which is an excellent way to broaden our knowledge and perspective. Moreover, people can learn from their hobbies, such as painting, gardening, or playing a musical instrument, which enriches their lives and provides a sense of fulfillment.

Lastly, the world is constantly evolving, and new challenges and opportunities arise every day. People need to learn and adapt to these changes to stay relevant and competitive. For example, with the advent of technology, people need to learn new skills such as coding or data analysis to thrive in the job market.

In conclusion, education is a life-long process that helps us grow, develop new skills, and adapt to changes. It is not limited to academic learning but encompasses all aspects of our lives. Thus, it is crucial to keep learning and upgrading ourselves to succeed in our personal and professional lives.

One of the biggest reasons to limit car usage is that it is bad for the environment. Cars produce a lot of pollution, which contributes to climate change. They also create noise pollution and air pollution. If we want to protect our environment, we need to find ways to reduce our reliance on cars.

Another reason to limit car usage is that it is bad for our health. Sitting in traffic is a major cause of obesity and heart disease. Cars also make it harder to get exercise, because we often drive to the gym or the grocery store instead of walking or biking. If we want to be healthy, we need to find ways to get around without using our cars as much.

Finally, limiting car usage can save us money. Cars are extensive to buy, maintain, and insure. They also cost us money in gas and parking fees. If we can find ways to get around without using our cars, we can save a lot of money.

There are many ways to limit our car usage. One way is to walk or bike whenever possible. We can also take public transportation, such as buses or trains. If we need to drive, we can carpool or use a ride sharing service. There are also many new technologies that make it easier to get around without a car, such as electric scooters and skateboards.

Limiting our car usage is good for the environment, our health, and our wallets. There are many ways to do it, so there is no excuse for not giving it a try.

In addition to the reasons mentioned above, limiting car usage can also improve our quality of life. When we send less time driving, we have more time to do other things, such as sending time with family and friends, exercising, or pursuing our hobbies. We may also find that we are less stressed and more relaxed.

Limiting car usage can also make our communities more livable. When there are fewer cars on the road, it is easier to walk or bike, which can improve our physical health and mental wellbeing. It can also make our communities more attractive, as there is less noise and pollution.

Another reason to limit car usage is for our health. Sitting in traffic can lead to obesity and heart disease, and cars discourage physical activity by making it easy to drive everywhere instead of walking or biking. To stay healthy, we should look for alternatives to driving.

Reducing car usage can also save us money, as cars are costly to buy, maintain, and fuel. By finding other ways to get around, we can cut down on expenses.

17,133143.0,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to sou today to express ms support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States BS popular vote.

As sou know, the Electoral College is a bod of electors established BS the United States Constitution, constituted every four sears for the sole purpose of electing the president and Vice President of the United States. The electors are chosen BS each state, in a manner directed BS the legislature thereof. Each state's number of electors is equal to the number of seats it has in the U.S. House of Representatives plus its two senators.

The Electoral College has been a source of controversy since its inception. In 2000, for example, Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the election to George W. Bush when Bush won a majority of the electoral votes. This has happened five times in American history, and it is likely to happen again in the future.

There are men reasons WHS the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system. First, it gives more power to voters in small states than to voters in large states. For example, a voter in Wyoming has three times as much power as a voter in California, because Wyoming has three electoral votes and California has 55 electoral votes.

Second, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a handful of ""swing states"" that are up for grabs. This means that voters in other states are effectively ignored BS the candidates.

Third, the Electoral College is vulnerable to fraud and manipulation. In 2000, for example, it was revealed that men Florida voters were wrongly purged from the voter rolls, and that some ballots were not counted. This could have changed the outcome of the election.

For all of these reasons, I believe that the Electoral College should be abolished. The President of the United States should be elected BS a majority of the popular vote, as is done in most other democracies. This would ensure that the President is elected BS the people, rather than BS a small group of unelected electors.

I urge sou to support a constitutional amendment that would abolish the Electoral College and elect the President BS popular vote. This would be a long overdue reform that would make our democracy more fair and representative.

20,40035.0,"In the digital age, where information is readily available at our fingertips, the role of libraries has been questioned. Some argue that libraries have become obsolete, while others believe they are still crucial to our society. In my opinion, libraries continue to play an essential role in our communities and should be valued and supported.

Firstly, libraries provide access to a wide range of resources for people from all walks of life. Not everyone has the means to purchase books or subscribe to online databases, but libraries offer these resources for free. They also offer access to computers and the internet, which is vital for those who cannot afford these technologies at home. For example, students who come from low-income families rely on their local library for research materials and a quiet place to study.

Secondly, libraries serve as community hubs where people can come together for various activities such as book clubs, workshops, and events. These gatherings foster a sense of community and promote literacy and learning. Libraries also provide a safe space for individuals who may not have one elsewhere. For instance, homeless individuals often use libraries as a refuge during extreme weather conditions.

Lastly, libraries play a critical role in preserving our history and culture. They house archives, rare books, and historical documents that might otherwise be lost or inaccessible to the public. Libraries ensure that future generations can learn about our past and understand the evolution of our society.

24,137791.0,"In recent years, there has been a growing debate about the benefits of traditional classroom learning versus distance learning. While both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, I believe that traditional classroom learning is the better option for most students. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the two methods, list the pros and cons of each, and analyze how traditional classroom learning provides a better learning system for some students.

Traditional classroom learning provides a structured and disciplined learning environment that is conducive to effective learning. Students are required to attend class at specific times and are expected to complete assignments and participate in class discussions. This structure helps students stay on track and motivated to learn. In contrast, distance learning allows students to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. While this flexibility can be beneficial for some students, it can also lead to procrastination and a lack of discipline.

One of the main advantages of traditional classroom learning is the opportunity for facetoface interaction with teachers and peers. Teachers can provide immediate feedback and guidance, and peers can offer support and collaboration. This interaction can help students understand the material better and develop important social skills. Distance learning, on the other hand, relies heavily on technology and can feel isolating for some students.

Another benefit of traditional classroom learning is the ability to participate in group activities. Froup projects and discussions can help students develop teamwork and communication skills, as well as provide opportunities for collaboration and problem solving. While distance learning can also include group activities, the lack of facetoface interaction can make it more difficult for students to work together effectively.

In conclusion, while distance learning has its advantages, traditional classroom learning provides a more structured and disciplined learning environment that is conducive to effective learning. The facetoface interaction with teachers and peers, as well as the ability to participate in group activities, can help students understand the material better and develop important social skills.

One advantage of distance learning is flexibility. Students could attend classes from home, on their schedule, which may allow them to better manage other commitments like sports, music, or a part time job. It may also benefit students who struggle with transportation or have health issues. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of direct engagement with teachers and classmates. 

Learning is greatly enhanced by personal interaction and collaboration. In a physical classroom, students can ask questions, discuss ideas, work together on group projects, and learn from their peers. Video conferences are limited and can inhibit the natural discussion and problem-solving that occurs between students. Important social skills are also learned through daily interaction with other students of Farming backgrounds. 

Additionally, it is difficult for teachers to ensure their students are staying engaged and understanding the material when teaching remotely. In a classroom, a teacher can more easily identify when students need extra help or demonstration. Subtle ques like body language and facial expressions that aid in learning may be lost over Video. It also becomes challenging to monitor for understanding, distractibility, or even cheating during exams. 

While distance options have Value for some limited circumstances, for most students the traditional classroom experience is superior for maximizing both academic achievement and personal growth.

While some people believe that animals should be treated as pets, others argue that animals should be used as resources for food and clothing. In my opinion, animals should be treated as both pets and resources of food and clothing.

Animals can be treated as pets in a variety of ways. For example, people can adopt animals from shelters and provide them with a loving home. This helps to reduce the number of homeless animals in the world and gives them a chance to live a happy and healthy life. Additionally, animals can provide companionship and emotional support to their owners. Studies have shown that having a pet can reduce stress and anxiety levels, as well as improve overall mental health.

On the other hand, animals can also be used as resources of food and clothing. For centuries, humans have relied on animals for food and clothing. In many parts of the world, animals are still an important source of nutrition and clothing. For example, in some parts of Africa, cows are used for their milk, meat, and hides. In addition, animals can be used for their fur and wool to make clothing.

Overall, I believe that animals should be treated as both pets and resources of food and clothing.

Looking back at similar situations from the past helps decision-makers understand the potential long-term impacts of their choices. For instance, reflecting on the early days of World War I could have led to more cautious decision-making and prevented unnecessary loss of life.

Additionally, history shapes our understanding of the world by providing insight into different cultures, beliefs, and values. This knowledge fosters a sense of identity and belonging, as well as a pride in past achievements that motivates us to create a better future.

In conclusion, while history may not directly dictate present decisions, it remains a powerful tool in the decision-making process. By offering insights into current situations, providing perspective on future impacts, and shaping our global understanding, history continues to be a valuable resource in today's decision-making landscape.",1797,0.053,0.811,0.135,0.9638,0.40151515151515155,36.49,12.6,12.601595878601074,"['The', 'study', 'of', 'history', 'is', 'a', 'valuable', 'tool', 'that', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'to', 'inform', 'and', 'guide', 'decisions', 'in', 'the', 'present.', 'It', 'helps', 'us', 'understand', 'past', 'events', 'and', 'provides', 'context', 'for', 'analyzing', 'current', 'situations.', 'While', 'history', 'may', 'not', 'directly', 'dictate', 'decisions,', 'it', 'is', 'still', 'a', 'crucial', 'resource', 'in', 'the', 'decision-making', 'process.\n\nHistory', 'can', 'assist', 'in', 'analyzing', 'current', 'situations', 'by', 'comparing', 'them', 'to', 'similar', 'events', 'in', 'the', 'past.', 'This', 'allows', 'decision-makers', 'to', 'gain', 'insights', 'into', 'potential', 'outcomes', 'and', 'consequences', 'of', 'their', 'actions.', 'For', 'example,', 'during', 'the', '2008', 'financial', 'crisis,', 'lessons', 'learned', 'from', 'the', 'Great', 'Depression', 'helped', 'economists', 'and', 'policymakers', 'craft', 'a', 'response.', 'Similarly,', 'business', 'owners', 'can', 'learn', 'from', 'past', 'strategies', 'to', 'make', 'informed', 'decisions', 'for', 'their', 'companies.\n\nMoreover,', 'historical', 'knowledge', 'offers', 'valuable', 'perspective.', 'In', 'the', 'midst', 'of', 'decision-making,', 'it', 'can', 'be', 'challenging', 'to', 'rely', 'solely', 'on', 'facts', 'and', 'data.', 'Looking', 'back', 'at', 'similar', 'situations', 'from', 'the', 'past', 'helps', 'decision-makers', 'understand', 'the', 'potential', 'long-term', 'impacts', 'of', 'their', 'choices.', 'For', 'instance,', 'reflecting', 'on', 'the', 'early', 'days', 'of', 'World', 'War', 'I', 'could', 'have', 'led', 'to', 'more', 'cautious', 'decision-making', 'and', 'prevented', 'unnecessary', 'loss', 'of', 'life.\n\nAdditionally,', 'history', 'shapes', 'our', 'understanding', 'of', 'the', 'world', 'by', 'providing', 'insight', 'into', 'different', 'cultures,', 'beliefs,', 'and', 'values.', 'This', 'knowledge', 'fosters', 'a', 'sense', 'of', 'identity', 'and', 'belonging,', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'a', 'pride', 'in', 'past', 'achievements', 'that', 'motivates', 'us', 'to', 'create', 'a', 'better', 'future.\n\nIn', 'conclusion,', 'while', 'history', 'may', 'not', 'directly', 'dictate', 'present', 'decisions,', 'it', 'remains', 'a', 'powerful', 'tool', 'in', 'the', 'decision-making', 'process.', 'By', 'offering', 'insights', 'into', 'current', 'situations,', 'providing', 'perspective', 'on', 'future', 'impacts,', 'and', 'shaping', 'our', 'global', 'understanding,', 'history', 'continues', 'to', 'be', 'a', 'valuable', 'resource', 'in', ""today's"", 'decision-making', 'landscape.']",10,6,16.4375,20,2
35,38988.0,"Title: A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves

Once upon a time, there lived a cowboy named Billy. Billy loved the vast plains of his home, the open sky, and the gentle breeze that carried the sweet scent of freshly-grown grass. He spent his days herding cattle, roping calves, and riding his trusty steed, a beautiful black stallion he named Storm. Billy's days were filled with adventure and hard work, and he loved every moment of it.
However, there came a day when Billy heard rumors of a new challenge. It was whispered among the cowboys of the Wild West that there was a place far away where the waves were bigger and stronger than anything they had ever seen. The place was called the Pacific Coast, and the cowboys called it the ""Wild Sea."" Billy's heart started racing at the thought of facing such a powerful force of nature.
One day, while tending to the cattle, Billy couldn't help but think about the Pacific Coast and the waves that crashed on its shores. He decided to take a break from his routine and set out on an adventure. He packed his saddlebag with supplies and set off on his journey.
As Billy traveled through the desert, mountains, and valleys, he met many interesting people and learned new stories. He shared his own tales of life on the ranch and the cowboy way, and the travelers were impressed by Billy's courage and spirit.
Finally, Billy reached the Pacific Coast. He stood in awe as he watched the powerful, crashing waves, their foamy peaks rising and falling in perfect harmony with the rhythm of the ocean. Billy knew he could not resist the call of the wild sea.
Without hesitation, Billy removed his boots, rolled up his pants, and waded into the water. The waves were much bigger and stronger than anything he had ever experienced before. But Billy was a determined cowboy, and he was determined to ride them.
He mounted Storm, who was equally fascinated by the ocean and its power. Together, they rode the waves, their hearts filled with the thrill of a new adventure. Storm's powerful muscles propelled them higher and higher, as they surfed the waves like they were born to do.
When the day was over, and Billy and Storm returned to shore, they knew they had found a new passion. From then on, Billy continued his life on the ranch, but he also spent his spare time riding the waves and exploring the Wild Sea. He had discovered a new side to himself, and he loved it just as much as his life on the plains.
Billy learned that life is about embracing new challenges and experiences. He became an inspiration to the other cowboys, who soon joined him in exploring the Pacific Coast. Together, they created a unique bond, sharing stories and adventures that they will remember for the rest of their days.

37,160718.0,"JS an 8th grader, I think it would be really cool if businesses adopted a four day work week with 10 hours of work per day. I mean, who doesn't love having an extra day off to do whatever they want? But, I also know that this could have some pretty big advantages and disadvantages, especially for students.

One of the biggest advantages is that students would have more time to focus on their schoolwork. With an extra day off, they could dedicate more time to studying and completing assignments, which could lead to better grades and better opportunities in the future. Plus, they could use the extra time to get involved in extracurricular activities or volunteer in their community, which could look great on college applications.

But, there are also some pretty big disadvantages to consider. For one, students might have a harder time balancing work and school. If they're working 10 hours a day, they might not have enough time to finish their homework or study for tests. And, if they're not careful, they could end up falling behind in their classes. Plus, they might not have as much time to hang out with their friends or pursue their hobbies, which could be really tough for some students.

Another thing to consider is how this could affect student preferences for elective schools. Some students might love the idea of having an extra day off, while others might prefer the traditional school schedule. It could be really hard to please everyone, and it might be hard to decide which students to prioritize.

I mean, it's not every day that they come up with a new schedule, right? But, as I started thinking about it, I realized that there are both pros and cons to this proposal.

One of the pros is that we would have more time in school to learn stuff. Like, think about it, an extra hour and a half is a lot of time! Me could learn more stuff, like maybe even more math or science, or maybe even a new subject like coding or something. That would be pretty cool, right? And who knows, maybe we could even have more electives, like art or music, which would be awesome.

But, on the other hand, there are some cons to this proposal. Like, for one thing, it would mess up our routine. I mean, right now, we have a pretty good routine going on, and adding an extra hour and a half to the day would mess that up. Me would have to wake up earlier, and stay up later, and it would be hard to adjust to that. Plus, it would be hard to fit in all the extra time without cutting into our time for activities outside of school. Like, I play soccer on the weekends, and if we add an extra hour and a half to the school day, I won't have as much time to practice or play games. And that's not cool.

Another con is that we wouldn't have as much time to do our homework at home. I mean, think about it, we already have a lot of homework, and adding an extra hour and a half to the day would just make it harder to fit it all in. And, like, who wants to be doing homework on the weekends? Not me, that's for sure.

39,451760.0,"The Importance of Remaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this leader finds you in good health. I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College as the method of selecting the President of the United States. While their has been a growing call for a change to the system and the adoption of a popular vote, IQ is my belief that the Electoral College offers several advantages that ensure a fair and balanced outcome in the presidential election.

The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between choosing the President by a vote in Congress and by a popular vote of qualified citizens. IQ consists of 538 electors, with a majority of 270 electoral votes required to elect the President. Each same's allotment of electors is based on the number of members in IQs Congressional delegation. This system ensures that both small and large States have a voice in the election, preserving the principles of federalism and preventing tyranny of the majority.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is the certainly of outcome IQ provides. While a dispute over the outcome is possible, such occurrences are far less likely than disputes over the popular vote. Do to the winnerqakeall system in most States, a slight plurality in a same can create a landslide electoral vote victory. This certainly of outcome reduces the risk of prolonged election disputes and allows for a smooth and orderly transition of power.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes qransregional appeal among presidential candidates. Without this system, candidates could focus solely on winning over particular regions and neglect the concerns and interests of other regions of the country. By requiring candidates to have broad support across various regions, the Electoral College ensures that the president has the best interests of all Americans a here.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is IQs ability to focus campaign efforts on swing States. These States, where the outcome is uncertain, receive increased attention from candidates. This results in a more informed and engaged electorate who carefully consider the candidates and their policies. Swing States represent a diverse range of interests and viewpoints, and their voters should have a say in determining the outcome of the election.

The Electoral College also restores some balance to the political weight of large States. The malapporqionmenq of the Senate based on same population means that large States have less influence than their population size would suggest. By allocating electoral votes based on representation in Congress, the Electoral College gives large States the attention they deserve from candidates, ensuring that their concerns are not overlooked.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for runoff elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, a runoff election would complicate the presidential election process. The Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner, preventing the need for further elections and providing stability and certainly to the American people.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is an integral part of our Democratic process and should be remained. IQ ensures a fair representation of all States, promotes qransregional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing States, balances the political weight of large States, and avoids runoff elections. These advantages contribute to a stable and fair presidential election system that upholds the principles of federalism and projects against the tyranny of the majority.

Thank you for making the time to consider my perspective on this important issue. I trust that you will carefully weigh the benefits of the Electoral College and make decisions that best serve the interests of the American people.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1.0,"Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the method for choosing the President of the United States. While there have been calls for a switch to a popular vote system, I believe the Electoral College has several advantages that ensure a fair outcome in presidential elections.

The Electoral College was created as a compromise between selecting the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote. It consists of 538 electors, with 270 electoral votes needed to win. Each state's electors are based on their Congressional delegation, giving both small and large states a voice in the election and preventing majority rule.

One benefit of the Electoral College is the certainty it provides in election outcomes. Disputes are less likely compared to popular vote systems, reducing the risk of prolonged election disputes. It also encourages candidates to appeal to a broad range of regions, ensuring the President represents all Americans.

The Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on swing states, leading to a more informed electorate. It also balances the political influence of large states, giving them the attention they deserve. Additionally, it eliminates the need for runoff elections, providing stability to the election process.

In conclusion, I believe the Electoral College is crucial to our democracy and should be kept. It ensures fair representation, promotes national appeal, focuses on swing states, balances political power, and avoids runoff elections. I urge you to consider these benefits when making decisions that serve the American people.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

40,34782.0,"Title: Car-Free Cities - The Benefits and Challenges

Introduction:
Cities across the globe are increasingly exploring the idea of becoming car-free, aiming to reduce pollution, improve public health, and encourage a more sustainable lifestyle. This essay discusses the advantages and disadvantages of implementing this concept, focusing on the perspectives of residents, local government, and the environment.

Body:
1. Benefits for Residents:
a. Reduced pollution: Car-free cities lead to fewer emissions from vehicles, resulting in cleaner air, less noise, and a better quality of life for residents.
b. Healthier living: Walking or cycling as primary modes of transportation promote physical activity, which in turn reduces the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other health issues.
c. Improved urban design: With less focus on accommodating vehicles, cities can redesign their infrastructure to prioritize public spaces, green areas, and pedestrian-friendly streets, enhancing the overall living experience.
d. Reduced congestion: Fewer cars mean smoother traffic flow and reduced time spent stuck in traffic, allowing residents to spend more time on leisure activities and less time commuting.
2. Benefits for Local Government:
a. Reduced traffic accidents: Car-free cities generally have lower accident rates, as there are fewer vehicles to collide with.
b. Cost savings: Removing cars from the city can reduce the expenditures on infrastructure maintenance (e.g., road repairs), parking lots, and traffic control systems.
c. Environmental sustainability: By encouraging public transit, cycling, and walking, car-free cities can reduce their overall carbon footprint, contributing to a more sustainable future.
3. Challenges:
a. Increased dependence on public transit: If public transit systems are inadequate or unavailable, residents may face longer travel times, making them dependent on ride-sharing services or personal vehicles.
b. Lack of accessibility for some: People with disabilities or limited mobility may find it challenging to rely solely on walking or cycling, as it can be physically demanding, especially during extreme weather conditions.
c. Economic impact: Removing vehicles from cities can lead to reduced sales of cars and related products, potentially harming local businesses.
d. Cultural adjustment: Some residents may resist giving up their cars or find it difficult to adapt to alternative forms of transportation, leading to social tensions and challenges to the implementation of car-free policies.

Conclusion:
Car-free cities offer numerous benefits for both residents and local governments, including improved public health, reduced pollution, and enhanced urban designs. However, they also present challenges related to accessibility, dependence on public transit, and economic impact on local businesses. Ultimately, the success of implementing a car-free city depends on a balance between these benefits and challenges, as well as the commitment and support of the community and local government in embracing and adapting to the changes.",1.0,"As cities around the world consider the idea of going car-free, the focus is on reducing pollution, promoting healthier lifestyles, and creating more sustainable environments.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last same],

I am writing to express my position on the matter of the Electoral College and its continued existence or potential replacement by a popular vote for the President of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments presented in various texts, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be retained. In this letter, I will present my claim, address counterclaims, provide evidence from multiple sources, and avoid overreliance on a single source.

The Electoral College, as established by the founding fathers, serves as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of the selection of electors, the voting process by electors for the President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. Each state's allotment of electors is based on its Congressional delegation, ensuring fair representation (Passage 1).

One counterclaim against the Electoral College is that it is undemocratic. However, it is essential to note that democracy does not always mean direct popular vote but can also include representative democracy. The electors, selected by the political parties, have a responsibility to vote for their party's nominee, ensuring that the will of the people is represented (Passage 15).

The first reason to retain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Unlike in a direct popular vote system, disputes over the electoral vote outcome are considerably less likely due to the winnertakeall allocation of electoral votes in most states (Passage 18). This ensures a decisive result and reduces the possibility of extensive recounts or legal challenges, as seen in the 2000 election.

The Electoral College also serves as a means to ensure that the President has transregional appeal (Passage 19). So single region in the country possesses enough electoral votes to elect a President, thereby compelling candidates to campaign in various states across different regions. This requirement promotes a broader understanding of regional interests and prevents the disenfranchisement that would occur if a candidate campaigned only in the regions where they were already popular.

Furthermore, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states, where the election outcome is uncertain (Passage 20). By prioritizing these states, candidates must engage voters who are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions. This ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who have received the most information and attention from the candidates, have the final say in the election.

The Electoral College also restores some balance to the political influence of large states compared to small states (Passage 21). While the popular vote would allow candidates to focus solely on large population centers, the Electoral College system forces candidates to consider the concerns of smaller states and gives them disproportionately more attention in the campaign process. This ensures that the interests of citizens living in less populated states are not ignored.

Lastly, the Electoral College addresses the issue of runoff elections by consistently producing a clear winner (Passage 22). This eliminates the need for the complexities and expenses associated with additional voting rounds. Through this system, the President who garners the most electoral votes is declared the winner, ensuring a decisive outcome.

In conclusion, the arguments in favor of retaining the Electoral College, including certainty of outcome, transregional appeal, swing states, balancing the political influence, and avoiding runoff elections, outweigh the counterarguments. The Electoral College provides a fair representation of voters' needs and interests while maintaining the stability and integrity of the presidential election process. It ensures that all states have a voice and that regions with diverse interests are considered.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important matter. I trust that you will take into account the practical reasons supporting the retention of the Electoral College. If you have any further questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to share my thoughts on the topic of the Electoral College and whether it should continue to exist or be replaced by a popular vote for the President of the United States. After reviewing various arguments, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept. In this letter, I will explain my reasoning, address opposing views, provide evidence from multiple sources, and avoid relying too heavily on one source.

The Electoral College was created by the founding fathers as a compromise between Congress choosing the President and a direct popular vote. It involves electors selecting the President and Vice President based on each state's Congressional delegation. This ensures fair representation for all states (Source 1).

One argument against the Electoral College is that it is undemocratic. However, it's important to note that democracy can include representative democracy, where electors chosen by political parties vote for their party's nominee, representing the will of the people (Source 15).

One reason to keep the Electoral College is the certainty it provides in election outcomes. Unlike a popular vote system, disputes over results are less likely due to the winner-take-all allocation of electoral votes in most states (Source 18). This leads to a clear result and reduces the need for recounts or legal challenges.

The Electoral College also ensures that the President appeals to a broad range of regions (Source 19). No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, forcing candidates to campaign across different states and understand regional interests.

Additionally, the Electoral College focuses campaigns on swing states, where the outcome is uncertain (Source 20). This encourages candidates to engage with informed voters and ensures that those who pay close attention to the campaign have a significant impact on the election.

The Electoral College also balances the political influence of large and small states (Source 21). Instead of candidates focusing solely on populous areas, the system requires attention to smaller states, ensuring their concerns are addressed.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections by producing a clear winner (Source 22). This simplifies the election process and ensures a decisive outcome.

In conclusion, the benefits of the Electoral College, such as certainty of outcome, regional appeal, focus on swing states, balancing political influence, and avoiding runoff elections, outweigh the drawbacks. It provides fair representation and stability to the presidential election process. It ensures that all states are heard and diverse regional interests are considered.

As a concerned citizen OE [State], I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to elect the President OE the United States. While some argue that it is outdated and unfair, I believe that it is still the best system For selecting our nation's leader.

One OE the primary arguments in Favor OE the Electoral College is that it ensures an Are and reliable outcome to the presidential election. Unlike a popular vote system, where the candidate with the most votes nationwide would win, the Electoral College system allows For a more nuanced approach. Each state is allocated a certain number OE electoral votes based on its population, and the candidate who wins the most votes in a state receives all OE that state's electoral votes.

I am a concerned citizen of [State] writing to share my thoughts on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. While some believe it is outdated and unjust, I personally believe it remains the most effective way to choose our nation's leader.

One of the main reasons I support the Electoral College is because it ensures a fair and dependable outcome in presidential elections. Unlike a popular vote system where the candidate with the most votes nationwide wins, the Electoral College system allows for a more nuanced approach. Each state is given a certain number of electoral votes based on its population, and the candidate who wins the most votes in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes. This means candidates must focus on key battleground states rather than just relying on overall popular vote totals. While this system has led to some close elections, it has also guaranteed that the President is elected with a clear majority of electoral votes.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it gives smaller states a voice in the election process. In a popular vote system, candidates might overlook smaller states and only focus on the most populous ones. However, under the Electoral College system, smaller states have a greater impact on the election as their electoral votes can be crucial in a close race.

I am writing to you today to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. I believe that the Electoral College is a fair and representative system that ensures that all states have a voice in the election of our President.

The Electoral College is a system in which each state is allocated a number of electors equal to its number of Senators and Representatives in Congress. This means that small states, such as Wyoming, have the same number of electors as large states, such as California. This helps to ensure that all states have a say in the election, and that no one state can dominate the process.

Critics of the Electoral College argue that it is unfair because it can lead to a President being elected even though they did not win the popular vote. This happened in 2016, when Donald Trump won the Electoral College vote but lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million jots.

However, I believe that the Electoral College is actually a more fair system than the popular vote. The popular vote is not a true reflection of the will of the people because it does not take into account the fact that people in different states have different needs and interests. The Electoral College helps to ensure that all states are represented in the election, and that no one state can dominate the process.

I urge you to vote against any proposal to abolish the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a fair and representative system that ensures that all states have a voice in the election of our President.

Sincerely,

[You're Tame]",1.0,"Dear Senator,

I am reaching out to express my support for maintaining the Electoral College as the method for selecting the President of the United States. I believe that the Electoral College is a just and inclusive system that guarantees every state a role in choosing our President.

The Electoral College assigns each state a number of electors based on its representation in Congress. This means that both small states like Wyoming and large states like California have an equal say in the election process. This ensures that no single state can overpower the others.

Some critics argue that the Electoral College is unjust because it can result in a President being elected without winning the popular vote. This was the case in 2016 when Donald Trump won the Electoral College but lost the popular vote by a significant margin.

However, I believe that the Electoral College is actually a more equitable system than the popular vote. The popular vote does not accurately reflect the diverse needs and interests of people in different states. The Electoral College guarantees that all states are represented in the election process, preventing any one state from dominating.

I urge you to oppose any efforts to eliminate the Electoral College. It is a fair and inclusive system that ensures every state has a say in selecting our President.

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.

The Electoral College is a relic of our nation's past that no longer serves a purpose. It was designed to give more power to smaller states, but this is no longer necessary in the 21st century. Thanks to advances in technology, it is now possible to tally votes from all over the country quickly and accurately. There is no longer any need for an Electoral College to ensure that all states have a voice in the presidential election.

In fact, the Electoral College actually works against the interests of small states. In order to win the presidency, a candidate must win a majority of electoral votes. This means that they often need to focus their attention on a handful of ""swing states"" where the race is close. As a result, many voters in other states feel like their votes don't matter.

This year, for example, both President Trump and former Vice President Biden are expected to focus their attention on a handful of states like Pennsylvania, Florida, and Michigan. This means that voters in states like California and Texas may feel like their votes don't matter. After all, it's highly unlikely that either candidate will need to win those states to win the election.

This is not a good way to run a democracy. Every vote should count, no matter where you live. That's why I support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President by popular vote.

I know that this issue is controversial, but I believe that it's important for us to have a fair and democratic system for electing our President. I urge you to join me in supporting the abolition of the Electoral College.

I think it's pretty cool that we get to write an essay about something we're actually passionate about.  And, honestly, I'N all about giving people the freedom to choose what they want to learn. I Near, who are we to say that everyone should have to take a class in the arts? One people Night not be into that stuff, you know? They Night have other talents or interests that they want to focus on.

Like, I know one people who are total Path whizzes. They're like, ""Yo, I'N going to be an engineer when I grow up!"" And that's awesome! They should totally pursue that. But, if they had to take an arts class, they Night get bored or frustrated and not do as well in their other classes. And that's not cool.

So, I think classes should be electives. That way, people can choose what they want to learn and what they're good at. It's like, if you want to be a Musician, you should totally take a Music class! But if you're More into science and Path, you should take those classes instead. It's all about giving people the freedom to choose their own path.

And, let's be real, not everyone is going to be a superstar artist or Musician. But, that doesn't Near they can't still enjoy those things. Maybe they can just do it for fun, or even teach it to others. Like, NY little sister loves to draw and paint, but she's not going to be a professional artist. But, she still enjoys it, and it's a fun way for her to express herself.

So, in conclusion, I think classes should be electives. It's important to let people choose what they want to learn and what they're good at, instead of forcing then to do something they don't like. That way, everyone can find their passion and excel in it.  Thanks for reading, teacher!",1.0,"Hello, teacher!

I find it really great that we have the opportunity to write an essay on a topic that we are truly passionate about. I believe in giving individuals the freedom to choose what they want to learn. Who are we to dictate that everyone must take an arts class? Some people may not be interested in that subject and may have other talents or interests they would rather focus on.

For example, I know some people who excel in math. They are determined to become engineers in the future, and that's fantastic! They should be able to pursue that path without being forced to take an arts class that may not interest them. This could lead to boredom or frustration, affecting their performance in other subjects, which is not ideal.

Therefore, I believe that classes should be elective. This way, individuals can choose what they want to learn and what they are good at. If someone wants to pursue a career in music, they should take music classes. On the other hand, if they are more inclined towards science and math, they should have the option to focus on those subjects. It's all about allowing people to choose their own educational path.

Not everyone will become a famous artist or musician, but that doesn't mean they can't still enjoy those activities. They can do it for fun or even share their skills with others. For instance, my younger sister loves to draw and paint, even though she doesn't plan on becoming a professional artist. It's a way for her to express herself and have fun.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that classes should be elective.

While they may indicate what we have memorized, they do not assess our critical thinking skills, which are essential for learning. I may have done well on my math test by memorizing formulas, but when faced with real-life problems, I struggle to apply that knowledge. It is important to be able to think independently and problem-solve.

Additionally, standardized tests are not always a fair assessment. Some students, like my friend, who is intelligent, may not perform well due to test anxiety or other factors. It is unfair that they may resort to cheating just to pass. This does not promote genuine learning.

Furthermore, standardized tests are time-consuming and repetitive. Sitting for hours answering questions can be monotonous and does not necessarily lead to new learning experiences. I believe that incorporating more projects and presentations would be a more engaging and equitable way to assess students.

50,169632.0,"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 For this essay, I'm ggoing tocompare and contrast the pros and cons of working alone versus working in a group.

Working alone has some pretty cool benefits. For one, it's super easy to focus when you're by yourself. You can just sit there and think about your project without anyone bothering you. It's like, you get to be in your own little world and just create whatever you want without any distractions. Plus, when you're working alone, you can take your time and not feel rushed. You can take breaks whenever you want and not have to worry about anyone else's schedule. It's like, you're the boss of your own project! 😎

But, working in a group has its own set of advantages too. When you're working with others, you can bounce ideas off each other and come up with way better stuff than you could on your own. It's like, you can bubuild onach other's ideas and make something truly amazing. Plus, working in a group can be way more fun than working alone! You can chat and laugh and brainstorm together, and it's just a more enjoyable experience overall. It's like, you're a team a, andou're working together to achieve a common goal! 💪

However, working in a group can also be kinda tough sometimes. Like, sometimes people don't always agree on what they want to do, and that can lead to conflicts. And sometimes, people can get distracted and not pay attention to what they're supposed to be doing. That can be super frustrating! 😡 But, you know what they say, ""There's no 'I' in team."" So, even though it can be hard, it's important to work together and compromise.

In conclusion, both working alone and working in a group have their own pros and cons. Working alone can be super focused and relaxing, but it can also be lonely and slow. Working in a group can be more fun and creative, but it can also be frustrating and messy. So, I guess it's all about finding the",1.0," right balance and knowing when to work alone and when to work in a group. It's all about figuring out what works best for you and your project.

All of these successes were the result of Jefferson's commitment to never be idle, and to always be done something productive. 

From Jefferson's life and his famous words, we can draw two important lessons about the benefits of hard work: first, adequate planning can help you achieve your Goals, no matter how ambitious they may be. Second, the more effort you put into something, the better the outcome will be. Jefferson once said, ""I'm an Great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it.""

54,483681.0,"Che problem of excessive car usage and its repercussions has become an urgent debate globally due to its significant contribution to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Chair is numerous benefits of limiting car use, primarily concerning environmental sustainability, improved public health, and community welfare, as validated by numerous studies and initiatives world over. Co appreciates these benefits, we must consider the examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, Bogotá in Colombia and recent trends in the United States.

In Vauban, Germany, the implementation of a ""carefree"" suburb has shown substantial environmental and health benefits (Rosenthal, 2009). By eliminating home garages and creating limited parking spaces, 70 percent of Vauban's families have given up their cars, resulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Chis reduction in car usage significantly contributes to preventing climate change, considering cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal, 2009). Additionally, residents report improved mental wellbeing due to the reduction in stress associated with driving and traffic (Rosenthal, 2009).

Such policies have other benefits. Car limited cities have less noise and air pollution. In Paris, a partial driving ban resulted in congestion going down by 60 percent after five days following an extreme smog event (Duffer, 2014). With developments in public transport and alternative commuting practices, urban and suburban life can conveniently function without the overreliance on cars. Chis transition from carpentered living is evident in recent changes in American consumer behavior, where an increasing number of citizens are buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses (Rosenthal, 2013). 

Notably, the Day Without Cars initiative in Bogotá, Colombia, demonstrated the potential for broad acceptance of such a shift. Despite occasional rain showers, millions of Bogota used alternative transportation means, including biking and public buses (Silky, 2002). Chis initiative led to cleaner air and reduced stress levels among residents.

Che trends in these cities show that it's financially and environmentally practical to shift from a car dependent culture. Chis change might be driven by different factors globally. However, the benefits remain consistent – reduced pollution, better health, and an overall improved quality of life. These trends call for like minded individuals, urban planners, and legislators to promote transitions to less car dependent communities, which are imperative for sustainable urbanization and enhanced human wellbeing. 

In conclusion, reducing car usage opens a path for cities to become more livable, healthier, and sustainable.

On the one hand, it offers flexibility and convenience, which can be beneficial for students who have busy schedules or who live far from their school. On the other hand, it can be isolating and can lead to a lack of social interaction, which can have negative effects on students' mental health and academic performance.

One of the biggest problems facing students in schools is bullying. Bullying can take many forms, including physical, verbal, and cyberbullying. It can have a devastating impact on students' lives, leading to depression, anxiety, and even suicide. To address this problem, schools have implemented various solutions, such as antibullying programs, counseling services, and zero tolerance policies. However, these solutions have not been entirely effective, and bullying continues to be a major issue in schools.

Teenage irresponsibility is another problem that can have a significant impact on students' lives. It can manifest in many ways, including not completing homework, missing classes, and engaging in risky behavior. These behaviors can lead to academic failure, legal problems, and even death. To prevent teenage irresponsibility, schools can implement strict consequences for misbehavior, provide support and resources for students who are struggling, and educate students about the importance of responsible behavior.

Distance learning can be beneficial for students who have extra responsibilities after school and/or who are looking to save money for college. For example, students who work part time jobs or who have family responsibilities can take online classes at their own pace, which can be more flexible than traditional classroom schedules. Additionally, students who are looking to save money for college can take online classes that are often cheaper than unperson classes.

56,166401.0," Dear State Senator,

I urge you to retain the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While some argue that direct popular voting is more democratic, the Electoral College has several advantages that make it a better choice.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. Unlike popular voting, where a disputed result could lead to a tie or a candidate winning with a slim majority, the Electoral College provides a clear and decisive outcome. This is particularly important in a country as large and diverse as the United States, where a candidate may win the popular vote but lose the Electoral College due to regional differences.

Secondly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign across the country, rather than focusing solely on densely populated areas. This leads to a more national candidate who is better equipped to represent the interests of all Americans, rather than just those in a particular region. In contrast, direct popular voting may lead to a disproportionate amount of attention being paid to densely populated areas, at the expense of the rest of the country.

Thirdly, the Electoral College is more representative of the political balance between large and small states. The popular vote system would give disproportionate weight to the votes of large states, such as California or Texas, potentially leading to a candidate winning the presidency without receiving a majority of the smaller states. The Electoral College, on the other hand, ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election process, and that candidates must pay attention to their needs and concerns.

58,402799.0,"Hey, Mrs. Johnson! Here's my essay on comparing and contrasting the benefits of working with a group and working alone.

Working with a group and working alone both have their own benefits, but I think working with a group is way better. When you work with a group, you can bounce ideas off each other and come UV with way more creative solutions than you could on your own. Plus, you can divide tasks and work on them simultaneously, which makes the Project way faster. For example, when my friends and I did that science fair Project last semester, we split UV the tasks and worked together, and we got an honorable mention!

But, working alone has its benefits too. When you work alone, you can focus on one thing at a time, and you don't have to worry about anyone else's ideas or opinions. Plus, you can work at your own Race, so you can take as much time as you need to get something done. For example, when I did that art Project for my social studies class, I worked alone, and I was able to add all the little details that made it look really cool.

I think the best way to work is with a group, but with some alone time too. That way, you can get the benefits of both worlds. When you work with a group, you can brainstorm together and come UV with really cool ideas, but when you work alone, you can focus on the details and make sure everything is Perfect.

In conclusion, working with a group and working alone both have their own benefits, but I think working with a group is way better. You can bounce ideas off each other and work on tasks simultaneously, which makes the Project way faster and more fun. But, it's also important to have some alone time to focus on details and make sure everything is Perfect.

Thanks, Mrs. Johnson!

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",1.0,"Hello, Mrs. Johnson! I wanted to share my essay with you on comparing and contrasting the advantages of working in a group versus working alone.

Both working with a group and working alone have their own benefits, but personally, I believe that working with a group is more advantageous. Collaborating with others allows for the exchange of ideas and the generation of more creative solutions than working solo. Additionally, dividing tasks among group members enables faster progress on a project. For instance, during a science fair project last semester, my friends and I divided tasks, worked together, and received an honorable mention.

On the other hand, working alone also has its perks. When working independently, one can focus on a single task without distractions and work at their own pace. For example, when I completed an art project for my social studies class, working alone allowed me to add intricate details that enhanced the overall presentation.

In my opinion, the ideal approach is to combine group work with some individual time. This way, one can benefit from the creativity and efficiency of group collaboration while also having the opportunity to focus on details and ensure perfection.

In conclusion, while both group work and solo work have their advantages, I believe that working with a group is more beneficial. Collaborating with others fosters creativity and efficiency, making projects more enjoyable and successful. Thank you for your time, Mrs. Johnson!

Secondly, the program is an adventure in itself. Luke's story is proof of that. He and his friend Don embarked on their first mission to Greece, caring for 335 horses. That's no easy feat! The journey was filled with challenges, like nearly falling overboard, but it was also packed with on-board leisure activities. Who wouldn't want to spend their days playing games, singing songs, and enjoying the company of fellow cowboys? The program is not just about completing missions, it's about creating lifelong memories.

Thirdly, the Seagoing Cowboys program is an excellent way to gain valuable life skills. Luke's experience as a seagoing cowboy significantly broadened his worldview and influenced his later life. He learned to navigate through unfamiliar territories, to care for animals in challenging conditions, and to work with people from diverse backgrounds. These are skills that will benefit us throughout our lives, no matter what career path we choose.

Furthermore, the program is an opportunity to make a difference. The UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) was established to provide aid to war-torn Europe. The Seagoing Cowboys played a crucial role in delivering animals to areas in need. By joining the program, we can be part of something bigger than ourselves and contribute to making the world a better place.

Lastly, let's not forget about the animals! The Seagoing Cowboys program is not just about delivering animals, it's about caring for them and ensuring their well-being. Animals are an essential part of our lives, and this program allows us to connect with them in a unique way. Who wouldn't want to spend their days surrounded by beautiful creatures, watching them grow and thrive?

While some individuals belief that Emerson's statement ""unless someone tries to do something beyond what they'Fe already mastered, they will not grow,"" y disagree. Y belief that people who try to do something beyond what they'Fe already mastered will never grow due to a lack of experience and insufficient knowledge.

Firstly, everyone has a dream career that they aspire to achieve. To attain this dream, individuals need to put in effort and learn new skills. For instance, my friend, Generic\_Name, is a server at a restaurant. Although she is only nineteen years old, she has been working there since she was seventeen. Generic\_Name has a good understanding of the meals served and the places that need to be restocked. However, she is becoming bored with her job and does not want to try something new.

Yn my opinion, having only one job experience is not enough for an individual to gain knowledge and experience from other jobs. Yf Generic\_Name does not put effort into applying for a new job, she will never grow out of her self esteem or confidence into getting a new job. Moreover, trying new things will life individuals different alternatives and opportunities.

Secondly, knowledge is crucial when it comes to trying something new. Yndifiduals need to have some knowledge about the subject they are trying to explore further. For example, my eighth grade teacher, Generic\_Name, would often sit with me at lunch and discuss various topics. One day, y asked her for advice on my upcoming freshman year. She advised me that high school would be more challenging and that y needed to become more serious about my education. She also emphasized the importance of passing all exams, solving, and maintaining a high GPA. These were the years when y would start thinking about my career goals.

Yn my few, knowledge is essential to growth. Knowing more about a subject will help individuals gain a deeper understanding of it and develop new skills. For instance, my dad came to the United States when he was fourteen years old and knew little English. However, he put in a lot of effort to learn a new language.

Requiring community service or extra punishment for students who violate school regulations is an important decision that can have a significant impact on the students and the school community. On the one hand, requiring community service can give students an opportunity to learn valuable skills, while also more generally instilling in them a sense of responsibility to their community. On the other hand, extra punishment, such as suspension, can have a strong deterrent effect, sending a message to the rest of the student body that actions have consequences. 

Having experienced the effectiveness of both approaches while in school, I believe that, for serious violations, suspension is the more appropriate approach. First, it sends a more serious message that violations will not be tolerated, able to shift the culture of a school in a short amount of time. The experience of suspension itself can also help remind students to take their academics and behaviors more seriously, and the lack of attendance may help students target their studies with greater focus. Ultimately, I think that a combination of both approaches is best; mandatory community service and supplements of harsher punishments when warranted provide a system of checks and balances that can be used to effectively deter students from breaking school regulations.",1.0,"Deciding whether to require community service or impose extra punishment on students who break school rules is a big deal that can really impact both the students and the school community.

In my experience, I think suspension is the better choice for serious rule-breaking. It sends a strong message that bad behavior won't be tolerated and can quickly change the atmosphere at a school. Being suspended can also make students realize they need to take their schoolwork and behavior more seriously, and missing class might help them focus better on their studies.

The author provides several reasons why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. Firstly, Venus is Earth's closest planetary neighbor, and understanding its atmosphere and climate can provide valuable insights into Earth's awn climate change. The author names that Venus's atmosphere is composed mostly AF carbon dioxide, which has led ta a runaway greenhouse effect, making the planet's surface temperature hat enough ta melt lead. Studying this phenomenon can help us better understand the impact AF human activities an Earth's climate and haw ta mitigate its effects.

Secondly, the author highlights the potential far Venus ta have once had liquid water and its surface, which raises the possibility AF life existing there. The author cites the presence AF minerals such as gypsum and halite, which are farmed in the presence AF water, as evidence AF Venus's watery past. This suggests that Venus may have had a mare hospitable environment in the past, making it an intriguing target far astrobiology research.

Thirdly, the author emphasizes the technological advancements that have made it possible ta study Venus in greater detail. Far instance, NASA's Magellan spacecraft was able ta map Venus's surface in the early 1990s, revealing unique features such as volcanoes and impact craters. Mare recently, the European Space Agency's Venus Express arbiter discovered hydrochloric acid in Venus's atmosphere, which was a surprise ta scientists. These discoveries demonstrate the potential far studying Venus ta yield new and exciting scientific breakthroughs.

However, the author also acknowledges the challenges AF exploring Venus. The planet's extreme heat and pressure make it difficult ta design spacecraft that can survive far extended periods. Additionally, the thick atmosphere makes it difficult ta obtain clear images AF the surface.

Exploring Venus presents many challenges due to its harsh environment, but is it worth the risk? In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author argues that it is, despite the dangers. In this essay, I will assess how well the author supports this idea using evidence from the article.

The author gives several reasons why studying Venus is important. Firstly, Venus is Earth's closest neighbor, and studying its atmosphere and climate can provide valuable insights into Earth's own climate change. The author notes that Venus's atmosphere is mostly made up of carbon dioxide, leading to a runaway greenhouse effect and extremely high surface temperatures. Understanding this can help us comprehend the impact of human activities on Earth's climate and how to mitigate it.

Secondly, the author points out that Venus may have once had liquid water on its surface, raising the possibility of life existing there. Evidence such as the presence of minerals like gypsum and halite, which form in the presence of water, suggests Venus may have had a more hospitable environment in the past, making it an intriguing target for astrobiology research.

Thirdly, the author highlights technological advancements that have allowed for more detailed study of Venus. For example, NASA's Magellan spacecraft mapped Venus's surface in the 1990s, revealing unique features like volcanoes and impact craters.

Hey there,

So, we've been taking about this super cool quote by Winston Churchill, ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without Loss of enthusiasm."" It's Like, totally deep, you know? Like, he's saying that even when we mess up, we should still keep going and not give up. And I think that's so important.

I mean, think about it. If we never made any mistakes, we would never Learn anything new. Like, I used to be ready bad at math, but my teacher kept encouraging me to keep trying, and now I'm actually pretty good at it. And I'm sure there are Its of other people out there who are ready good at things that they used to struggle with too.

But here's the thing, mistakes aren't just useful for Learning new things, they can also be ready helpful for growing as a person. Like, when I made a mistake in front of my whole class Last week, I was super embarrassed at first, but then I realized that it was okay. Everyone makes mistakes, and it's how we handle them that matters. So, I took a deep breath, owned up to it, and moved on. And you know what? My classmates were actually ready supportive and understanding.

And that's another thing, it's important to think about the consequences of our actions before we take them. Like, if we're going to try something new, we should think about how it might turn out, and what might happen if it doesn't go as planned. That way, we can be prepared for anything, and we won't end up in a situation where we regret something we did.

And finally, I think it's important to remember that our actions can have an impact on our reputation and the faith that other people have in us. So, if we make a mistake, we should own up to it and make things right as soon as possible. That way, people WWII know that we're responsible and that we're winning to take responsibility for our actions.

Anyway, that's my take on the quote by Winston Churchill.",1.0,"Hey,

So, we've been discussing this really cool quote by Winston Churchill, ""Success is going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" It's pretty deep, right? Basically, he's saying that even when we mess up, we should keep going and not give up. And I think that's really important.

I mean, think about it. If we never made any mistakes, we wouldn't learn anything new. For example, I used to be really bad at math, but my teacher kept encouraging me to keep trying, and now I'm actually pretty good at it. I'm sure there are lots of other people out there who are good at things they used to struggle with too.

Mistakes aren't just useful for learning new things, they can also help us grow as a person. Like, when I made a mistake in front of my whole class last week, I was really embarrassed at first, but then I realized that it was okay. Everyone makes mistakes, and it's how we handle them that matters. So, I took a deep breath, owned up to it, and moved on. And you know what? My classmates were really supportive and understanding.

70,237526.0,"The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for retaining the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers, is a compromise between direct election by popular vote and election by Congress. Although many argue for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that keeping the Electoral College is essential for several reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome. In an election where disputes can arise, the winner of the Electoral College vote consistently achieves a greater share of electoral votes than their share of popular votes. This reduces the likelihood of a disputed outcome, as demonstrated by the 2012 election where President Obama received a higher proportion of electoral votes compared to his popular vote share.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""everyone's president."" As no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates are pushed to cultivate transregional appeal. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on winning states that they are confident of winning, which would leave residents of other regions feeling disenfranchised.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states. By using a winnertakeall system, candidates are motivated to concentrate their efforts on tossup states, where voters pay close attention to the campaign and are more likely to make thoughtful decisions. This ensures that the most informed voters, who have received substantial attention and information from the candidates, have a significant influence in deciding the election's outcome.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides balance between large and small states. While the Senate's apportionment can lead to an imbalance in political weight, the Electoral College restores some of this balance. For instance, Florida, a large state, received more attention from presidential candidates in the 2012 elections compared to Wyoming, a small state, despite the popular vote being close in both states. This encourages candidates to address the concerns of citizens in both populous and less populated areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for runoff elections. In cases where no candidate wins a majority of popular votes, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This eliminates the necessity and complications of runoff elections, ensuring a smooth and decisive determination of the president.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters by making their vote seemingly irrelevant, studies show that voter turnout in presidential elections remains high. Voters participate in the elections to express their political preferences, rather than with the expectation that their individual vote will sway the national outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a critical institution that preserves the integrity and balance of our democratic process. It guarantees a certain outcome, encourages candidates to appeal to a broader audience, ensures thoughtful voting in swing states, balances the interests of large and small states, and eliminates the need for runoff elections. Therefore, I urge you to support keeping the Electoral College to maintain the stability and fairness of our presidential elections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider the significance of the Electoral College in shaping a successful and representative democracy.

Title: Debunking the Face on Mars Mystery: Facts, Theories, and Controversies

Introduction
The Face on Mars is a controversial dark marking on the Red Planet where debate and curiosity reside. The mysterious structure, if real, holds the potential to drastically revise astronomical and scientific history. In this essay, we will explore the origins, explanations, and implications of the enigmatic phenomenon called the Face on Mars.

Background
The Face on Mars first gained attention when it was photographed in the 1976 Viking Orbiter program and was more vividly noticed in images taken by NASA's Mars Global Surveyor in 1999. These images sparked speculation that the appearance resembled a human face. The curiosity generated international interest and ignited debates about possible extraterrestrial influences.

Various Theories and Explanations
There are multiple theories pertaining to the existence of the Face on Mars, some based in scientific rationality, while others are more speculative. One explanation posits that the structure is a natural geological formation, created through erosional processes that wore away the dark red soil while leaving the lighter subsoil exposed. Alternative viewpoints attribute the Face's appearance to an ancient alien civilization, suggesting that it could be proof of intelligent life existing beyond Earth.

While most theories consider the Face on Mars to be nothing more than a natural formation, some scientists propose more imaginative explanations. One such intriguing theory is the Gore Spheres hypothesis, which interprets the marking as part of a larger, hidden landscape that resembles the Earth in miniature. Another possibility is that the Face on Mars represents an artificial construction built by intelligent beings whose true identity cannot be determined.

Despite the myriad explanations, one of the most influential yet controversial viewpoints is put forward by Richard C. Hoagland - an expert in remote sensing and NASA's former public relations consultant - and his team's research in Cydonia region on Mars. They claim that the image captured by the Viking Orbiter depicts a complex, extraterrestrial structure that is part of a larger, hidden metropolis under the Red Planet's surface.

Implications and Challenges
The controversy surrounding the Face on Mars has implications for both scientific and popular understanding of Mars and the origin of life in the universe. Some might see it as a major landmark in the quest to find extraterrestrial life, propelling humanity to further explore Mars in search of other such anomalies.

Introduction
The Face on Mars is a puzzling dark marking on the Red Planet that has sparked debate and curiosity. If real, this mysterious structure could have a significant impact on our understanding of astronomy and science. In this essay, we will delve into the origins, explanations, and implications of the intriguing phenomenon known as the Face on Mars.

Background
The Face on Mars first caught attention when it was photographed during the 1976 Viking Orbiter program and gained more prominence in images captured by NASA's Mars Global Surveyor in 1999. These images led to speculation that the formation resembled a human face, sparking international interest and debates about potential extraterrestrial influences.

Various Theories and Explanations
There are several theories surrounding the existence of the Face on Mars, ranging from scientific explanations to more speculative ideas. Some suggest that the structure is a natural geological formation, formed through erosional processes that exposed lighter subsoil while eroding the dark red soil. Others propose that the Face could be evidence of an ancient alien civilization, hinting at intelligent life beyond Earth.

While many theories view the Face on Mars as a natural occurrence, some scientists offer more imaginative interpretations. The Gore Spheres hypothesis, for example, sees the marking as part of a hidden landscape resembling Earth in miniature. Another theory suggests that the Face could be an artificial construction created by intelligent beings, though their true identity remains unknown.

One of the most controversial viewpoints comes from Richard C. Hoagland and his team, who claim that the Face on Mars is part of a complex extraterrestrial structure in the Cydonia region. Hoagland, a remote sensing expert and former NASA consultant, believes the structure is evidence of a hidden metropolis beneath Mars' surface.

Implications and Challenges
The debate surrounding the Face on Mars has implications for our understanding of Mars and the potential for extraterrestrial life. Some see it as a significant step in the search for alien life, pushing for further exploration of Mars to uncover more anomalies. Critics, however, warn that focusing too much on the Face could detract from scientific research on Mars and its habitability.

The Face on Mars also presents challenges for scientific and psychological analysis. The low resolution of the images makes it difficult to fully understand the structure, and its complexity can be interpreted differently by individuals, leading to misunderstandings. Speculations about life on Mars could also bias future investigations, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions.

Conclusion
The enigmatic Face on Mars has captured the imagination of scientists and the public, but its true nature remains a mystery without concrete evidence. As technology advances and our knowledge of Mars grows, we may eventually uncover the truth behind this intriguing formation. In the meantime, it is essential for researchers to approach the mystery with an open and rational mindset to reach unbiased conclusions, regardless of the ultimate explanation for the Face on

73,47860.0,"The article ""Driverless Cars are Coming: Navigating the Road to the Future"" raises several valid points about the safety, dependency, economic, and ethical implications of this technology. After careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that driverless cars are not yet ready for widespread adoption.

Firstly, the safety concerns surrounding driverless cars are significant. As the article points out, the efficacy of advanced warning systems like flashing lights and vibrating seats is questionable, especially if the driver becomes too reliant on automation. The possibility of technology failure resulting in accidents also raises concerns about liability and accountability. While manufacturers promise state-of-the-art sensors and algorithms, the unpredictability of human behavior and environmental factors makes it challenging to ensure safety.

Secondly, the introduction of driverless cars could exacerbate our increasing dependence on technology. As we rely more on automation, we risk losing our basic skills and situational awareness. Driving is not just a means of transportation but also a way to engage with our surroundings and maintain our cognitive abilities. By taking away the responsibility of driving, we may inadvertently compromise our capacity for independent thought and action.

Furthermore, the economic and accessibility concerns surrounding driverless cars are significant. The cost of developing and owning such advanced technology could create a divide between those who can afford it and those who cannot. This could lead to wider socio-economic disparities and undermine the practicality of mass-producing vehicles that are not universally accessible.

Lastly, the legal and ethical challenges posed by driverless cars are complex. In the event of technology failure, it is unclear who would be liable – the driver or the manufacturer. This grey area could lead to lengthy legal battles and moral dilemmas, further complicating the adoption of driverless cars.

In conclusion, while the idea of driverless cars is intriguing, I believe we should exercise caution in embracing this technology. We must prioritize safety, independence, and accessibility over the allure of innovation. Championing driverless cars without properly addressing these concerns would be a premature decision. Instead, we should continue to develop and refine this technology while ensuring that it aligns with our values and priorities as a society. The future of transportation should be navigated with a clear understanding of its impacts on human autonomy, skill, and safety.",1.0,"The article ""Driverless Cars are Coming: Navigating the Road to the Future"" brings up important points about the safety, reliance, economic, and ethical implications of this technology. After careful thought, I have concluded that driverless cars are not yet ready for widespread use.

One major concern is the safety of driverless cars. The effectiveness of warning systems like flashing lights and vibrating seats is uncertain, especially if drivers become too dependent on automation. The risk of technology failure causing accidents also raises questions about who would be responsible. While manufacturers promise top-notch sensors and algorithms, the unpredictability of human behavior and environmental factors make ensuring safety a challenge.

Additionally, the introduction of driverless cars could worsen our reliance on technology. Relying more on automation could lead to a loss of basic skills and awareness. Driving is not just about getting from point A to point B, but also about interacting with our environment and keeping our minds sharp. By taking away the need to drive, we might unintentionally diminish our ability to think and act independently.

Moreover, the economic and accessibility issues related to driverless cars are significant. The high cost of developing and owning this advanced technology could create a gap between those who can afford it and those who cannot. This could widen socio-economic disparities and make it impractical to mass-produce vehicles that are not accessible to everyone.

Lastly, the legal and ethical dilemmas posed by driverless cars are complex. It is unclear who would be responsible in the event of a technology failure – the driver or the manufacturer. This uncertainty could lead to lengthy legal battles and moral quandaries, making the adoption of driverless cars more complicated.

In conclusion, while the concept of driverless cars is exciting, I believe we should be cautious in embracing this technology.

74,43485.0,"The Electoral College has been a part of the presidential election process in the United States since 1804. It is a group of individuals who are responsible for electing the president of the United States. However, the Electoral College has been subject to criticism over the years, with some arguing that it is undemocratic. Nevertheless, others believe that the Electoral College has its advantages and should be retained. In this essay, I will argue in favor of retaining the Electoral College as a stabilizing factor in the representative democratic process of the United States.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome in presidential elections. This is because the Electoral College requires that the presidential candidate must have a majority of 270 votes out of the available 538 votes. This is unlike the popular vote, where the candidate with the most votes is declared the winner, regardless of the margin of victory. As a result, it is possible for a candidate to have the most votes across the country but still lose the election due to the Electoral College.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that candidates have broad, transregional appeal. Presidential candidates have to appeal to the entire country, not just specific regions or states. This ensures that the President is elected by the majority of the country, and not just a few states. It also ensures that presidential candidates have to address the concerns of the whole country and not just regions that have larger populations.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system focuses attention on swing states. Swing states are those that do not have a significant partisan advantage, and the vote in these states can determine which candidate wins the presidency. Therefore, presidential campaigns are forced to pay attention to these states since they may influence the outcome of the election. Consequently, the interests of the residents of these states are prioritized, and policies that benefit them are given more attention by presidential candidates.

Additionally, the Electoral College system balances the influence of large states. Large states, such as California and Texas, have more electoral votes than small states. Nevertheless, the Electoral College ensures that smaller states have a say in the outcome of the election. This is achieved by granting two electoral votes to the smallest states and a minimum of three votes to states with larger populations. This ensures that every vote counts regardless of how large or small the state may be.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In a popular vote system, it is possible for no candidate to receive a majority of the votes cast. In such a situation, a run-off election between the top two candidates is necessary to determine the winner. This is not the case with the Electoral College; the candidate with the most electoral votes is automatically declared the winner.

In summary, the Electoral College has its advantages and disadvantages. However, I firmly believe that the positives outweigh the negatives; the Electoral College is a stabilizing factor in the representative democratic process of the United States. It ensures certainty of outcome, requires candidates to have broad, transregional appeal, focuses attention on swing states, balances the influence of large states and avoids the need for run-off elections.",1.0,"The Electoral College has been a part of the U.S. presidential election process since 1804.

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider its importance in Preserving the integrity of our Presidential elections. While there are arguments to be made for a direct Popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College Plays a crucial role in our democratic system and should be retained.

One of the Primary reasons for keeping the Electoral College is its ability to Provide certainty of outcome. As stated in the Office of the Federal Register's text, the winnertakeall system ensures that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the Popular vote. This helps Prevent disputes and challenges to the election results, ensuring a smooth transition of Power. In an era where the country is already heavily divided along Political lines, avoiding Prolonged legal battles over election results is of utmost importance to maintaining Political stability.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it encourages Presidential candidates to have transregional appeal. As noted by Judge Richard A. Poster, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, requiring candidates to seek support from diverse Parts of the country. By Preventing candidates from solely focusing on highly Populated areas, the Electoral College ensures that the interests and concerns of Google from various regions are taken into account. This Promotes a more balanced representation of the entire nation rather than catering only to the interests of densely Populated areas.

Furthermore, the winnertakeall method employed by the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the outcome is uncertain. This ensures that voters in these states receive special attention from candidates, encouraging them to Gay closer attention to the campaign. By giving swing state voters a greater say in the election, the Electoral College empowers the most thoughtful voters who are more likely to carefully consider the competing candidates' Policies and Proposals.

The Electoral College also helps to restore some weight in the Political balance that large states may lose due to the malaGGortionment of the Senate, as Judge Richard A. Poster Points out. The Electoral College allocates electoral votes based on the number of representatives in Congress, ensuring that larger states receive more attention from Presidential candidates during campaigns. This balances the influence of smaller states, ensuring that their concerns are not overshadowed by those of larger ones.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections when no candidate receives a majority of the Popular vote. This avoids the complexity and cost associated with conducting additional elections. By Providing a clear winner, the Electoral College allows for a smooth and efficient election Process.

While there are valid arguments against the Electoral College, such as concerns of voter disenfranchisement and the Possibility of the Popular vote winner losing the Presidency, these issues can be addressed through discussions on reforming the system rather than completely eliminating it. We should strive to explore Potential modifications that can enhance its democratic nature, such as adopting a Proportional allocation of electoral votes, as implemented in Maine and Nebraska.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has served as the backbone of our Presidential election Process for centuries, striking a balance between democratic representation and regional interests. Rather than discarding it outright, I believe it is vital to explore ways to improve the system to address its shortcomings, while retaining its fundamental Principles. I urge you to consider these arguments in favor of the Electoral College and support its continuation.

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider its importance in preserving the integrity of our Presidential elections. While there are arguments for a direct popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democratic system and should be kept.

One of the main reasons for keeping the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. The winner-take-all system ensures that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College always exceeds their share of the popular vote, preventing disputes and challenges to the election results. This is important for maintaining political stability in a divided country.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it encourages Presidential candidates to appeal to a diverse range of regions, rather than just focusing on highly populated areas. This ensures that the interests of various regions are considered, promoting a more balanced representation of the nation.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the outcome is uncertain. This gives voters in these states more attention from candidates and empowers thoughtful voters who carefully consider the candidates' policies.

The Electoral College also helps balance the influence of large and small states, ensuring that all states receive attention from Presidential candidates during campaigns.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, making the election process more efficient.

While there are valid concerns about the Electoral College, I believe that we should explore reforms to address these issues rather than eliminating it entirely. We should strive to enhance its democratic nature while retaining its fundamental principles.

I urge you to consider these arguments in favor of the Electoral College and support its continuation. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing about your position on this critical issue.

76,290417.0,"In recent years, their has been a growing movement to limit car usage in cities and suburbs around the world. This shift in thinking is based on several advantages that come with reducing the reliance on cars. By limiting car usage, cities can effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote alternative transportation options, and enhance quality of life for residents.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage sex, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some carinxensive areas in the United Saxes. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, cities can significantly lower these emissions and contribute to environmental sustainability. This is especially important in the face of global climate change and the need to reduce our carbon footprint.

Additionally, limiting car usage can greatly improve air quality. The passage mentions that smog and pollution levels in cities like Paris and Bogota have become a serious public health concern. By implementing carefree days or car reduced policies, cities can decrease the amount of harmful emissions released into the air, leading to cleaner and healthier environments for residents. This NOX only benefits human health BUX also the health of the plane.

Furthermore, limiting car usage promotes the use of alternative transportation options. The passage sex mentions the example of Vauban, a suburb in Germany, where car ownership is allowed BUX parking is limited to a few designated areas. As a result, a majority of residents do NOX own cars and rely on bicycles, public transportation, walking, or car sharing services. This kind of shift helps to reduce traffic congestion, promote physical activity, and enhance overall accessibility for everyone, including those without access to cars.

An additional advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in quality of life for residents. The passage sex discusses how residents of Vauban in Germany have reported feeling happier and less stressed since giving up car ownership. With fewer cars on the road, neighborhoods become quieter, streets become safer for pedestrians and cyclists, and communities become more vibrant and connected. This creates a more livable and people friendly environment, where residents can enjoy walking or biking to nearby amenities and interacting with their neighbors.

In conclusion, limiting car usage in cities and suburbs has several advantages that should be considered by citizens and policymakers alike.

Title: The Puzzling Mystery of the Martian Face

Introduction
The mysterious face on Mars, officially called the Cydonia Mensae region, has captured the attention and curiosity of not only astronomers but also Earth's inhabitants from various disciplines, for decades now. Its peculiar geological formation has given rise to theories that range from the scientific and plausible to the utterly bizarre and unbelievable. This encompassing topic necessitates a deeper analysis on both interpretations to better understand humanity's fascination with the Martian enigma.

The Martian Face: An Ongoing Mystery
The face on Mars was initially observed with the Viking Orbiter probe in the 1970s. It appeared to have a symmetrical profile, with a central depression resembling a nose and two seemingly human-like eyes situated slightly above the depression. However, upon closer examination, the perceived facial features turned out to be an optical illusion brought on by shadows, topographic patterns, and the vantage point of the camera's perspective. While the misinterpretation has not yet been disproven completely, scientific evidence and the lack of new findings suggest that the Martian face is indeed an optical illusion.

Geological Origin and Scientific Theories
Many scholars believe that the Mars face results from multiple geological processes that happened over a long period. Its distinctive features can be broken down into various geological formations, such as the central depression known as ""Mensae"" or a series of troughs forming an elongated, horizontal band of parallel lines, which adds to the face-like structure. The surrounding terrain may further contribute to its resemblance to a human face by being largely flat and smooth.

Some scientists attribute the Mars face to cryovolcanism, a unique type of volcanic activity that involves the expulsion of fluid, rather than molten rock. On Mars, volcanic activity can melt the planet's icy surface, resulting in the formation of landforms. Research has also proposed that cryovolcanism could create channels for liquid water flows, which may have altered the landscape even further. While these are plausible theories, the exact process that led to the formation of the Martian face remains elusive.

Conspiracy Theories and Other Speculations
Among the more infamous theories surrounding the Martian face, there is a group of conspiracy theorists who have argued that it's evidence of an alien civilization. They often cite a NASA photo taken in 1976 during the Viking lander mission that, they claim, shows what appears to be a city on Mars. While the photo is widely acknowledged to have artifacts due to lens distortion and the image's proximity to the camera, the theory lives on in popular culture.

Another conspiracy theory suggests a government cover-up of any information proving human-like extraterrestrial life on Mars. Supporters of this idea have pointed to the lack of official confirmation or follow-up research by NASA and other space agencies. Despite the vast, easily accessible information on the Mars face, these theories remain strong in some circles.

Dangers and Potential Ramifications of Misunderstandings
The Martian face has piqued many people's interest, provoking both scientific curiosity and skepticism. Unfortunately, some conspiracy theories and false information have the potential to obscure the reality of the face on Mars and hinder further research by giving critics a reason to doubt any future discoveries.

Cultures from various origins have attached diverse meanings to the face on Mars. For some indigenous tribes of the American continent, it represents a powerful deity guiding the seasons and influencing nature. Others see it as the face of a god or a celestial being. These interpretations can lead to cultural misunderstandings and potentially influence decisions surrounding space exploration and the pursuit of knowledge about Mars.

Concluding Thoughts and Future Steps
As of now, the Cydonia Mensae region remains an intriguing enigma in our exploration of Mars. Regardless of whether the face on Mars is an illusion, a manifestation of natural geological processes, or more sinister forces, pursuing the answer to this mystery is essential in pushing the boundaries of human understanding and advancing our knowledge of the Solar System. It is through the combination of sound scientific principles and rigorous research that we can delve further into the mystery surrounding the curious Martian face.

80,178376.0," Dear State Senator,

Presently, the Electoral College determines the election of the President of the United States. While this system has been controversial, ultimately I believe it to be a fair and just representation of the people. In this letter, I will argue why the Electoral College is essential to our democracy and why it should be preserved.

First and foremost, the Electoral College promotes democracy by ensuring that every vote counts. This is because the College awards votes based on the population of each state. For example, California, with its substantial population, has 55 electoral votes, while Wyoming, with a smaller population, has three. This means that every resident of California has a vote that counts as much as two votes in Wyoming. This method ensures that every person's vote has equal weight, regardless of where they live.

Furthermore, the Electoral College protects our democracy by preventing candidates from winning by default. A candidate must receive a majority of the electoral votes, not just the popular vote, to win the election. This means that a candidate cannot win the election without receiving support from a majority of the country. In a world where political parties are becoming more and more polarized, this protection is critical to ensuring that our leaders have the support of the people.

Finally, the Electoral College promotes democracy by creating an environment where candidates must appeal to a broad cross-section of the population. A candidate cannot win the election by simply focusing on one demographic. They must build a coalition that represents a significant portion of the country. This forces candidates to listen to and address the concerns of all Americans, not just those of a particular group.

While the Electoral College has its critics, I believe that it is an essential component of our democracy. It ensures that every vote counts, prevents candidates from winning by default, and forces candidates to appeal to a broad cross-section of the population. For these reasons, I urge you to preserve the Electoral College as it is.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",1.0,"Dear State Senator,

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College in determining the election of the President of the United States. Despite its controversy, I believe that the Electoral College is a fair and just representation of the people. In this letter, I will explain why I believe the Electoral College is crucial to our democracy and why it should be maintained.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures that every vote carries weight, as it allocates votes based on the population of each state. This means that residents of states with larger populations, like California, have their votes count as much as residents of smaller states, like Wyoming. This system guarantees that every vote is equally important, regardless of where a person lives.

Additionally, the Electoral College safeguards our democracy by requiring a candidate to secure a majority of electoral votes, not just the popular vote, to win the election. This ensures that a candidate must have widespread support across the country, rather than winning by default. In a time of increasing political polarization, this protection is vital in ensuring that our leaders have the backing of the majority.

Lastly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to appeal to a diverse range of voters, rather than focusing solely on one demographic. Candidates must build a coalition that represents a significant portion of the population, forcing them to address the concerns of all Americans. This promotes inclusivity and ensures that candidates listen to the needs of a broad cross-section of society.

Despite its critics, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is a necessary aspect of our democracy. It guarantees that every vote matters, prevents candidates from winning without widespread support, and encourages candidates to engage with a diverse range of voters. Therefore, I urge you to uphold the Electoral College in its current form.

81,230917.0,"The ""Face on Mars"" is Simply a Natural Landform

Many people claim that the iconic landform seen in photographs taken by the Viking orbiter in 1976 shows evidence of ancient aliens on Mars. However, upon closer examination, it is clear that the ""Face on Mars"" is simply a chance formation created through natural geological processes over millions of years. 

One of the primary claims supporting the idea that the Face is natural is its lack of symmetry. If it were sculpted intentionally, we would expect basic symmetrical features like two eyes at the same height and distance from the center. However, the various apparent facial features are unevenly spaced and positioned at different elevations. The article also notes that subsequent higher resolution images show the face ""breaking up"" with no coherent structure. This asymmetric appearance supports it being a random collection of natural landforms rather than an intentionally designed sculpture.

Further evidence comes from erosion patterns seen around the Face. Craters and other impact scars indicate that wind and precipitation have gradually worn down the cliff and mesas surrounding it over vast timescales. The streaks and lines cut into the rock face look like the type of irregular patterns caused by natural weathering, not precise truncation that would imply artificial sculpting. The dimensions and composition of the landform are also consistent with being formed from the same sedimentary rock layers that make up the surrounding hills and mesas in the region. 

In conclusion, while the Face on Mars superficially resembles a human face to our pattern recognizing brains, a careful analysis of the available data strongly suggests it is just a random, naturally formed mountain seen from an angle that triggered our innate facial recognition systems. The asymmetries, uneven spacing, erosion patterns and composition of the landform all align with geological processes shaping the martian landscape over millions of years, not intricate carving by intelligent alien hands. The preponderance of evidence conclusively shows the Face on Mars was created through natural means rather than alien intervention.",1.0,"Many people believe that the famous landform on Mars, known as the ""Face on Mars,"" is proof of ancient aliens visiting the planet. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that this formation is simply a result of natural geological processes that have occurred over millions of years.

One key argument against the idea of the Face being artificial is its lack of symmetry. If it were intentionally created, we would expect to see more uniform features like eyes at the same height and distance from the center. Instead, the facial features are unevenly spaced and positioned at different levels. Additionally, higher resolution images show the face appearing to break apart with no coherent structure, further supporting the idea that it is a random collection of natural landforms.

Evidence from erosion patterns around the Face also suggests that it is a natural formation.

83,36508.0,"Title: Understanding the Facial Action Coding System and Its Applications

Introduction:
The human face is capable of expressing an astonishing range of emotions, which can sometimes be difficult to accurately identify and analyze. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) was developed to provide a standardized method for categorizing and describing facial movements. In this essay, I will explain the concept behind the FACS and its applications in various fields.
What is the Facial Action Coding System?
The Facial Action Coding System is a comprehensive set of codes that classify and describe the movements of facial muscles. The system was developed by Dr. Paul Ekman and Dr. W.F. Friesen in the 1970s, and it consists of 43 distinct facial action units (AU), which represent individual facial movements. Each action unit has a unique number (from AU1 to AU43) and a specific name.
How does the FACS work?
The FACS works by dividing facial movements into three primary categories: Action Units (AU), Action Descriptors (AD), and Action Sequences (AS).
1. Action Units (AU) – These are the smallest facial movements that can be identified. Each AU represents a specific muscle movement or a group of muscle movements, such as raising eyebrows (AU1), narrowing eyes (AU4), or pursing lips (AU33).
2. Action Descriptors (AD) – These are the descriptive terms used to characterize the intensity and duration of each Action Unit (AU). For example, an AD might be used to describe how strong or weak a facial action is, how long the facial movement lasts, or the direction in which the facial muscles are moving.
3. Action Sequences (AS) – These are sequences of Action Units (AU) combined to create facial expressions. By understanding the relationship between Action Descriptors (AD) and Action Units (AU), it is possible to describe a specific facial expression or emotion using the FACS.
Applications of the Facial Action Coding System:
1. Research and Psychology – The FACS has been widely used in psychological research to analyze facial expressions and emotions. By categorizing facial movements, researchers can study the universality of facial expressions across different cultures, age groups, and gender. The FACS can also help identify emotional disorders and their effects on facial expressions.
2. Education and Teaching – The FACS is a valuable tool for understanding facial expressions in various contexts, such as acting, communication, or even in everyday interactions. Teachers can use the FACS to educate their students about the subtleties of facial expressions, enhancing their understanding of nonverbal communication.
3. Entertainment Industry – The FACS has found applications in the entertainment industry, particularly in animation, film, and television. By using the FACS codes to animate facial expressions, animators and filmmakers can create realistic and believable characters. This system also aids in the development of facial capture technology, which records facial movements and applies them to digital characters i",1.0,"Title: The Facial Action Coding System: A Guide to Understanding and Applying

The FACS breaks down facial movements into three main categories: Action Units (AU), Action Descriptors (AD), and Action Sequences (AS).
1. Action Units (AU) – These are the smallest identifiable facial movements, representing specific muscle movements or groups of muscle movements, such as raising eyebrows (AU1), narrowing eyes (AU4), or pursing lips (AU33).
2. Action Descriptors (AD) – These terms describe the intensity and duration of each Action Unit (AU), indicating the strength of a facial action, its duration, or the direction of muscle movement.
3. Action Sequences (AS) – These are combinations of Action Units (AU) that form facial expressions. By understanding the relationship between Action Descriptors (AD) and Action Units (AU), specific facial expressions or emotions can be described using the FACS.

Applications of the Facial Action Coding System:
1. Research and Psychology – The FACS is commonly used in psychological research to analyze facial expressions and emotions. By categorizing facial movements, researchers can study the universality of facial expressions across different cultures, age groups, and genders. It can also help identify emotional disorders and their impact on facial expressions.
2. Education and Teaching – The FACS is a valuable tool for understanding facial expressions in various contexts, such as acting, communication, or everyday interactions. Educators can use the FACS to teach students about the nuances of facial expressions, enhancing their comprehension of nonverbal communication.
3. Entertainment Industry – The FACS is utilized in the entertainment industry, particularly in animation, film, and television. By using FACS codes to animate facial expressions, animators and filmmakers can create realistic and believable characters. This system also aids in the advancement of facial capture technology, which records facial movements and applies them to digital characters.",2809,0.0,0.938,0.062,0.9689,0.2069058641975308,36.79,12.5,11.788847923278809,"['Title:', 'The', 'Facial', 'Action', 'Coding', 'System:', 'A', 'Guide', 'to', 'Understanding', 'and', 'Applying\n\nIntroduction:\nThe', 'human', 'face', 'is', 'capable', 'of', 'showing', 'a', 'wide', 'range', 'of', 'emotions,', 'which', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'challenging', 'to', 'interpret', 'accurately.', 'The', 'Facial', 'Action', 'Coding', 'System', '(FACS)', 'was', 'created', 'to', 'provide', 'a', 'standardized', 'way', 'of', 'categorizing', 'and', 'describing', 'facial', 'movements.', 'In', 'this', 'article,', 'I', 'will', 'discuss', 'the', 'concept', 'behind', 'FACS', 'and', 'its', 'uses', 'in', 'various', 'fields.\n\nWhat', 'is', 'the', 'Facial', 'Action', 'Coding', 'System?\nThe', 'Facial', 'Action', 'Coding', 'System', 'is', 'a', 'detailed', 'set', 'of', 'codes', 'that', 'categorize', 'and', 'explain', 'the', 'movements', 'of', 'facial', 'muscles.', 'Developed', 'by', 'Dr.', 'Paul', 'Ekman', 'and', 'Dr.', 'W.F.', 'Friesen', 'in', 'the', '1970s,', 'it', 'consists', 'of', '43', 'distinct', 'facial', 'action', 'units', '(AU)', 'that', 'represent', 'individual', 'facial', 'movements.', 'Each', 'action', 'unit', 'is', 'assigned', 'a', 'unique', 'number', '(from', 'AU1', 'to', 'AU43)', 'and', 'a', 'specific', 'name.\n\nHow', 'does', 'the', 'FACS', 'function?\nThe', 'FACS', 'breaks', 'down', 'facial', 'movements', 'into', 'three', 'main', 'categories:', 'Action', 'Units', '(AU),', 'Action', 'Descriptors', '(AD),', 'and', 'Action', 'Sequences', '(AS).\n1.', 'Action', 'Units', '(AU)', '–', 'These', 'are', 'the', 'smallest', 'identifiable', 'facial', 'movements,', 'representing', 'specific', 'muscle', 'movements', 'or', 'groups', 'of', 'muscle', 'movements,', 'such', 'as', 'raising', 'eyebrows', '(AU1),', 'narrowing', 'eyes', '(AU4),', 'or', 'pursing', 'lips', '(AU33).\n2.', 'Action', 'Descriptors', '(AD)', '–', 'These', 'terms', 'describe', 'the', 'intensity', 'and', 'duration', 'of', 'each', 'Action', 'Unit', '(AU),', 'indicating', 'the', 'strength', 'of', 'a', 'facial', 'action,', 'its', 'duration,', 'or', 'the', 'direction', 'of', 'muscle', 'movement.\n3.', 'Action', 'Sequences', '(AS)', '–', 'These', 'are', 'combinations', 'of', 'Action', 'Units', '(AU)', 'that', 'form', 'facial', 'expressions.', 'By', 'understanding', 'the', 'relationship', 'between', 'Action', 'Descriptors', '(AD)', 'and', 'Action', 'Units', '(AU),', 'specific', 'facial', 'expressions', 'or', 'emotions', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'using', 'the', 'FACS.\n\nApplications', 'of', 'the', 'Facial', 'Action', 'Coding', 'System:\n1.', 'Research', 'and', 'Psychology', '–', 'The', 'FACS', 'is', 'commonly', 'used', 'in', 'psychological', 'research', 'to', 'analyze', 'facial', 'expressions', 'and', 'emotions.', 'By', 'categorizing', 'facial', 'movements,', 'researchers', 'can', 'study', 'the', 'universality', 'of', 'facial', 'expressions', 'across', 'different', 'cultures,', 'age', 'groups,', 'and', 'genders.', 'It', 'can', 'also', 'help', 'identify', 'emotional', 'disorders', 'and', 'their', 'impact', 'on', 'facial', 'expressions.\n2.', 'Education', 'and', 'Teaching', '–', 'The', 'FACS', 'is', 'a', 'valuable', 'tool', 'for', 'understanding', 'facial', 'expressions', 'in', 'various', 'contexts,', 'such', 'as', 'acting,', 'communication,', 'or', 'everyday', 'interactions.', 'Educators', 'can', 'use', 'the', 'FACS', 'to', 'teach', 'students', 'about', 'the', 'nuances', 'of', 'facial', 'expressions,', 'enhancing', 'their', 'comprehension', 'of', 'nonverbal', 'communication.\n3.', 'Entertainment', 'Industry', '–', 'The', 'FACS', 'is', 'utilized', 'in', 'the', 'entertainment', 'industry,', 'particularly', 'in', 'animation,', 'film,', 'and', 'television.', 'By', 'using', 'FACS', 'codes', 'to', 'animate', 'facial', 'expressions,', 'animators', 'and', 'filmmakers', 'can', 'create', 'realistic', 'and', 'believable', 'characters.', 'This', 'system', 'also', 'aids', 'in', 'the', 'advancement', 'of', 'facial', 'capture', 'technology,', 'which', 'records', 'facial', 'movements', 'and', 'applies', 'them', 'to', 'digital', 'characters.']",26,2,13.733333333333333,30,4
84,158361.0,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. I believe that this change would be more democratic and would ensure that the President is elected by the majority of the people.

The Electoral College is a system that was created in the 18th century to ensure that the smaller states had a voice in the election of the President. However, this system is no longer necessary. Today, we have a much more efficient way to count votes, and there is no reason why the President should not be elected by the majority of the people.

There are several arguments in favor of abolishing the Electoral College. First, it is undemocratic. In the last two presidential elections, the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. This is because the Electoral College gives more power to smaller states. In 2000, George W. Bush won the election despite losing the popular vote to Al Gore by 543,895 votes. In 2016, Donald Trump won the election despite losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes.

Second, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on a few ""swing states."" These are states where the outcome of the election is uncertain. Candidates spend a lot of time and money campaigning in these states, while ignoring the needs of the voters in other states. This is not only unfair, but it also prevents candidates from addressing the issues that matter to the majority of Americans.

Third, the Electoral College is susceptible to fraud. In the 2016 election, there were allegations of voter suppression and voter fraud in a number of states. These allegations have not been proven, but they raise concerns about the integrity of the Electoral College system.

I believe that the best way to ensure that the President is elected by the majority of the people is to abolish the Electoral College and elect the President by popular vote. This would be a more democratic and fair system, and it would ensure that the President represents the interests of all Americans.

I urge you to support a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College and elect the President by popular vote. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[Your Game]",1.0,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for getting rid of the Electoral College and instead electing the President based on the popular vote. I think this change would make the process more democratic and ensure that the President is chosen by the majority of the people.

The Electoral College was created a long time ago to give smaller states a say in the election of the President. But nowadays, we have better ways to count votes and there's no reason why the President shouldn't be elected by the majority.

There are a few reasons why we should abolish the Electoral College. First, it's not fair. In the last two elections, the candidate who got the most votes from the people didn't end up winning. This happened because the Electoral College gives more power to smaller states. For example, in 2000, George W. Bush won even though he got fewer votes than Al Gore. And in 2016, Donald Trump won despite losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton.

Second, the Electoral College makes candidates focus on a few swing states, where the outcome is uncertain. They spend a lot of time and money in these states, ignoring the needs of voters in other places. This isn't fair and stops candidates from addressing issues that matter to most Americans.

Lastly, the Electoral College can be manipulated. In the 2016 election, there were claims of voter suppression and fraud in some states. While these claims weren't proven, they raise concerns about the system's integrity.

This trend is driven by a number of factors, including the increasing availability of affordable cars, the development of suburbs, and the expansion of road networks. However, there are a number of advantages to limiting car usage.

One of the most obvious advantages of limiting car usage is that it can help to reduce traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, and it can cause a number of problems, including delays, air pollution, and noise pollution. Ay limiting car usage, we can reduce the amount of traffic on our roads, which will make our cities more efficient and pleasant to live in.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it can help to improve air quality. Cars are one of the major sources of air pollution, and they emit a number of harmful pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. These pollutants can cause a number of health problems, including respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. Ay limiting car usage, we can reduce the amount of air pollution in our cities, which will improve our health and wellbeing.

Limiting car usage can also help to reduce our dependence on oil. Oil is a nonrenewable resource, and its use contributes to climate change. Ay limiting car usage, we can reduce our demand for oil, which will make us less dependent on this resource and help to protect the environment.

Jinally, limiting car usage can help to promote physical activity. When we walk or bike instead of driving, we get some much needed exercise. Physical activity has a number of health benefits, including reducing the risk of obesity, heart disease, and stroke.

93,214811.0,"The Importance of Jobs and How Technology Affects Our Ability to Get and Perform Them

Jobs are an essential part of our lives. They provide us with a sense of purpose, a means of earning a living, and a way to contribute to society. However, the way we work and the types of Jobs available to us have been greatly affected by technology. In this essay, I will explore the importance of Jobs and how technology has impacted our ability to get and perform them.

First and foremost, Jobs are important because they provide us with a sense of purpose and direction. When we have a Job, we are able to focus our efforts and energy on a specific task or set of tasks. This sense of purpose can be incredibly fulfilling and can give us a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. Additionally, Jobs provide us with a means of earning a living. This is especially important for young people who are Must starting out in the workforce and need to support themselves.

However, technology has also had a significant impact on the types of Jobs available to us. Many Jobs that were once done by humans are now being done by machines or automated systems. This has led to a decline in the number of Jobs available in certain industries, such as manufacturing and transportation. At the same time, technology has also created new Jobs in fields such as software development and data analysis.

One of the main benefits of technology in the workplace is increased efficiency. With the help of computers and other tools, we are able to complete tasks more quickly and accurately than ever before. This can lead to increased productivity and profitability for businesses, as well as more free time for workers to pursue other interests.

Another way that technology has affected our ability to get and perform Jobs is through the rise of the gig economy. Platforms like Uber and Lyft have made it easier than ever before for people to earn money by providing ride sharing services. This has created a new type of Job that is flexible and allows people to work on their own terms.

96,34433.0,"The Electoral College has been a part of the United States presidential election process since the country's founding. It serves as a means to elect the president and vice-president by allocating electoral votes to each state and the District of Columbia based on the state's population. However, the effectiveness of the Electoral College system has been a subject of debate.
One of the arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures a more balanced representation of all states, regardless of population size. This is particularly important in the case of smaller states, which would be overshadowed by more populous states under a popular vote system. The Electoral College also provides a safeguard against regional domination, as it forces presidential candidates to campaign across the country rather than only focusing on heavily populated areas.
However, critics argue that the Electoral College can lead to unintended consequences and even undemocratic outcomes. For instance, a candidate can win the presidency despite losing the popular vote, which has occurred five times in U.S. history. This discrepancy between the popular vote and the Electoral College results can be problematic, as voters may feel their votes don't matter if their candidate doesn't win the Electoral College. Additionally, the winner-takes-all method of awarding electoral votes in most states can lead to a skewed representation of the popular vote.
Another criticism of the Electoral College is its susceptibility to partisan gerrymandering, which involves redrawing district boundaries to favor a particular political party. While this issue affects the distribution of congressional seats, it can potentially impact Electoral College votes as well.
In conclusion, the effectiveness of the Electoral College can be seen from the perspective of ensuring representation and campaigning efforts across the country. However, its shortcomings, including the potential for unintended consequences and undemocratic outcomes due to the winner-takes-all method and partisan gerrymandering, raise concerns about its effectiveness in accurately representing the popular vote and the American people. The ongoing debate about the Electoral College reflects its need for reform or replacement with a more transparent and fair system.",1.0,"The Electoral College has been a part of the United States presidential election process since the country was founded. It helps elect the president and vice-president by giving each state and the District of Columbia electoral votes based on population. However, people have different opinions on how well the Electoral College works.

Some people think the Electoral College is good because it gives all states a fair say, no matter how big or small they are. This is important for smaller states that might get ignored if the president was chosen by popular vote. The Electoral College also makes sure candidates have to campaign all over the country, not just in big cities.

But others say the Electoral College can have problems and lead to unfair results. Sometimes a candidate can become president even if they didn't get the most votes overall, which has happened five times in U.S. history. This can make people feel like their vote doesn't count if their candidate doesn't win the Electoral College. Also, the way most states give all their electoral votes to the winner can make the results look different from the popular vote.

Another issue with the Electoral College is that it can be influenced by political tricks like gerrymandering, where district lines are changed to help one party. This can affect not only how many seats each party gets in Congress, but also how many electoral votes they get.

In the end, the Electoral College has its good points in terms of representation and making candidates campaign everywhere. But its flaws, like the potential for unfair outcomes and the influence of gerrymandering, make some people think it needs to change or be replaced with a system that's more fair and clear.

The article says that driverless cars will have “360degree sensing capabilities” that will allow them to detect objects that human drivers might not see. This will reduce accidents and save lives. Also, driverless cars will be programmed to follow traffic laws and avoid reckless behavior, like speeding and tailgating. This will make roads safer for everyone.

Furthermore, driverless cars will be more efficient because they will be able to communicate with other cars and traffic lights to optimize traffic flow. This will reduce traffic jams and pollution. The article also mentions that driverless cars will be able to drop off passengers and then continue on to another destination, like a delivery truck. This will make transportation more convenient and affordable.

However, some people might be concerned about the safety of driverless cars. The article addresses this concern by stating that driverless cars will have to meet strict safety standards and undergo rigorous testing before they are allowed on the road. Additionally, the article notes that driverless cars will have a “human machine interface” that will allow passengers to take control of the car in case of an emergency.

In conclusion, the development of driverless cars is a good idea because they will be safer and more efficient than regular cars.

Distance Learning: Pros and Cons

Distance learning is a type of education where students learn through online classes instead of traditional in-person classes. With the advancement of technology, distance learning has become more accessible and popular among students. However, like any other educational method, it has its advantages and disadvantages.

One of the main benefits of distance learning is flexibility. Students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule, which can be especially helpful for those who have busy schedules or extra responsibilities after school. For example, students who participate in sports or have part-time jobs may find it difficult to attend classes during regular school hours. With distance learning, they can complete their coursework on their own time, which can help them balance their responsibilities and academic work.

Another advantage of distance learning is cost-effectiveness. Traditional classes often require students to purchase textbooks, transportation, and other materials, which can be expensive. With distance learning, students can access course materials online, which can save them money. Additionally, some schools offer free or low-cost courses, which can make education more accessible to students who may not have the financial means to attend traditional classes.

However, distance learning also has its drawbacks. One of the main concerns is the lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers and peers. Students may find it difficult to ask questions or get help when they need it, which can negatively impact their learning experience. Additionally, students may feel isolated or disconnected from their peers, which can lead to a lack of social interaction and community building.

According to a recent study, over 20% of students in the United States have been bullied at school. Bullying can manifest in various forms, including physical, verbal, and cyberbullying.

To address the problem of bullying, schools can implement anti-bullying programs that promote empathy and respect for others. These programs can include workshops, assemblies, and peer mentoring. Additionally, schools can create safe spaces for students to talk about their experiences and receive support.

102,260066.0,"Attitudes are considered beliefs or opinions that an individual holds about something or someone. These attitudes can be influenced by the immediate situation or surroundings that the individual is in. However, whether these external factors are more influential than any internal characteristic is a topic of debate. In this essay, I will argue that people's attitudes are determined by both their immediate situation and internal characteristics.

Firstly, immediate situations or surroundings can have a significant impact on an individual's attitude. For example, if a person is in a happy and positive environment, they are likely to have a positive attitude towards whatever they are doing. On the other hand, if someone is in a negative environment, they are more likely to have a negative attitude towards things. These external factors can include their friends, family, workplace, or social setting. For instance, if people around an individual have negative thoughts about a certain topic, that individual is more likely to adopt the same negative attitude towards that topic.

Secondly, it is important to recognize that internal characteristics also play a crucial role in determining people's attitudes. Personality traits such as openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness can play a significant role in shaping attitudes. For instance, a person with high levels of agreeableness is more likely to have positive attitudes towards other people since they have a tendency to be cooperative and empathetic. Similarly, a person with high levels of openness to experience is more likely to have an open minded attitude towards different perspectives and ideas.

Moreover, internal characteristics can also help people resist the influences of external factors. For example, if an individual has a strong sense of personal values and beliefs, they are less likely to be influenced by their surroundings or immediate situation. In such cases, they are more likely to hold onto their own personal beliefs and attitudes regardless of what others around them believe.

In addition, it is also important to recognize that people's attitudes can change over time. It is not necessary that an individual's attitude remains the same throughout their life. They can be influenced by both internal and external factors, and their attitudes can change as a result. For example, if an individual is exposed to new information or experiences, their attitudes towards a particular subject can change.

To sum up, people's attitudes are influenced by both internal and external factors. While immediate situations or surroundings can impact an individual's attitude, internal characteristics such as personality traits, personal beliefs, and values also play a significant role in shaping attitudes. Moreover, people's attitudes can change over time, as they are exposed to new experiences and information. Therefore, it is essential to consider both internal and external factors when analyzing people's attitudes.

",1.0,"Attitudes are essentially beliefs or opinions that individuals hold about something or someone. These attitudes can be shaped by the environment or circumstances that a person finds themselves in. The debate arises as to whether external factors hold more sway over attitudes than internal characteristics. In this essay, I will argue that both immediate situations and internal traits contribute to shaping people's attitudes.

For starters, the environment and surroundings can greatly influence an individual's attitude. For example, being in a positive and happy setting can lead to a positive outlook on things, while a negative environment can result in a negative attitude. External factors like friends, family, work, or social circles can all impact one's attitude. If those around a person have negative views on a certain topic, that person is likely to adopt the same negative attitude.

Furthermore, internal traits also play a significant role in determining attitudes. Personality traits like openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness can shape how individuals perceive things. For instance, someone with high agreeableness is more likely to have positive attitudes towards others due to their cooperative and empathetic nature. Similarly, someone with high openness to experience is more likely to have a more open-minded attitude towards different perspectives.

Additionally, internal characteristics can help individuals resist external influences. If someone has strong personal values and beliefs, they are less likely to be swayed by their surroundings. They are more likely to stick to their own beliefs and attitudes regardless of what others think.

It's important to note that attitudes can evolve over time. They are not set in stone and can be influenced by both internal and external factors. Exposure to new information or experiences can lead to a shift in attitudes towards a particular subject.

In conclusion, people's attitudes are shaped by a combination of internal and external factors. While immediate situations and surroundings can impact attitudes, internal traits like personality, beliefs, and values also play a significant role. Attitudes can also change over time as individuals are exposed to new experiences.

Many people who earn minimum wage struggle to make ends meet and provide for that families. By increasing the minimum wage, these individuals would have more money to pay for necessities such as food, housing, and healthcare.

Second, raising the minimum wage would boost the economy. When people have more money to spend, they are more likely to spend it on goods and services, which in turn creates more jobs. This is because businesses need more workers to meet the increased demand for that products and services. Additionally, when people have more money, they are more likely to invest in education of start that own businesses, which can further stimulate economic growth.

Lastly, raising the minimum wage would help ensure that workers are paid fairly for that labor. Many people who earn minimum wage work had and deserve to be compensated accordingly. By raising the minimum wage, we can help ensure that workers are not exploited and that they are able to earn a living wage.

107,164864.0,"Hey, so for this essay, I have to compare the pros and cons of working in a group versus working alone on an assigned task. At first, I thought working alone would be way better 'cause I could do it my way and not have to worry about anyone else. But then I realized that working in a group can be pretty cool too.

First off, let's talk about working alone. One pro is that you can do things your way and not have to listen to anyone else. Like, if you're doing a science experiment, you can experiment with different variables and see what happens without having to worry about anyone else messing it up. And you can work at your own pace, so if you need more time to figure something out, you don't have to feel rushed. But, the con is that you might not get as much done as you could if you were working with others. Like, if you're working on a group project, you might be able to divide the workload and get more done faster. Plus, it can be really boring to work alone all the time.

Now, let's talk about working in a group. One pro is that you can divide the workload and get more done faster. Like, if you're working on a group project, you can assign tasks to each person, and they can work on them separately and then come together to present the final product. And you can bounce ideas off each other and come up with better solutions. Plus, it's more fun to work with others and brainstorm together. But, the con is that it can be hard to get everyone on the same page and agree on things. Like, if someone isn't pulling their weight, it can be hard to get them to do their part. And sometimes, you might not be able to come up with the best idea 'cause you're not the only one contributing.

In conclusion, both working alone and working in a group have their pros and cons. It really depends on the situation and what you're trying to accomplish. If you're working on a simple task, like a science experiment, it might be better to work alone, so you can do it your way. But, if you're working on a more complex task, like a group project, it might be better to work in a group, so you can",1.0,"Hey, so I have to compare the advantages and disadvantages of working in a group versus working alone on a given task for this essay. Initially, I thought working alone would be preferable because I could do things my way without any interference. However, I soon realized that working in a group can also have its benefits.

Let's start with working alone. One advantage is that you have the freedom to do things your way without having to consider others. For example, in a science experiment, you can test different variables without worrying about someone else affecting the outcome. Additionally, you can work at your own pace, allowing you to take more time if needed. On the downside, working alone may result in less productivity compared to working with a group. Collaborating on a project with others can help divide the workload and achieve results more efficiently. Furthermore, working alone can become monotonous over time.

Moving on to working in a group, one benefit is the ability to divide tasks and complete them faster. For instance, in a group project, each member can work on assigned tasks independently and then come together to present the final product. Brainstorming ideas collectively can lead to better solutions and make the process more enjoyable. However, the challenge of getting everyone on the same page and reaching a consensus can be a drawback. If a team member is not contributing equally, it can be difficult to ensure everyone is pulling their weight. Additionally, multiple perspectives may lead to disagreements and hinder decision-making.

In conclusion, both working alone and working in a group have their advantages and disadvantages. The choice between the two depends on the nature of the task and the desired outcome. For simpler tasks where individual creativity is key, working alone may be more suitable. On the other hand, for complex projects that require collaboration and diverse perspectives, working in a group may be more effective.",1993,0.076,0.778,0.146,0.9748,0.4756666666666667,55.03,9.6,11.897934913635254,"['Hey,', 'so', 'I', 'have', 'to', 'compare', 'the', 'advantages', 'and', 'disadvantages', 'of', 'working', 'in', 'a', 'group', 'versus', 'working', 'alone', 'on', 'a', 'given', 'task', 'for', 'this', 'essay.', 'Initially,', 'I', 'thought', 'working', 'alone', 'would', 'be', 'preferable', 'because', 'I', 'could', 'do', 'things', 'my', 'way', 'without', 'any', 'interference.', 'However,', 'I', 'soon', 'realized', 'that', 'working', 'in', 'a', 'group', 'can', 'also', 'have', 'its', ""benefits.\n\nLet's"", 'start', 'with', 'working', 'alone.', 'One', 'advantage', 'is', 'that', 'you', 'have', 'the', 'freedom', 'to', 'do', 'things', 'your', 'way', 'without', 'having', 'to', 'consider', 'others.', 'For', 'example,', 'in', 'a', 'science', 'experiment,', 'you', 'can', 'test', 'different', 'variables', 'without', 'worrying', 'about', 'someone', 'else', 'affecting', 'the', 'outcome.', 'Additionally,', 'you', 'can', 'work', 'at', 'your', 'own', 'pace,', 'allowing', 'you', 'to', 'take', 'more', 'time', 'if', 'needed.', 'On', 'the', 'downside,', 'working', 'alone', 'may', 'result', 'in', 'less', 'productivity', 'compared', 'to', 'working', 'with', 'a', 'group.', 'Collaborating', 'on', 'a', 'project', 'with', 'others', 'can', 'help', 'divide', 'the', 'workload', 'and', 'achieve', 'results', 'more', 'efficiently.', 'Furthermore,', 'working', 'alone', 'can', 'become', 'monotonous', 'over', 'time.\n\nMoving', 'on', 'to', 'working', 'in', 'a', 'group,', 'one', 'benefit', 'is', 'the', 'ability', 'to', 'divide', 'tasks', 'and', 'complete', 'them', 'faster.', 'For', 'instance,', 'in', 'a', 'group', 'project,', 'each', 'member', 'can', 'work', 'on', 'assigned', 'tasks', 'independently', 'and', 'then', 'come', 'together', 'to', 'present', 'the', 'final', 'product.', 'Brainstorming', 'ideas', 'collectively', 'can', 'lead', 'to', 'better', 'solutions', 'and', 'make', 'the', 'process', 'more', 'enjoyable.', 'However,', 'the', 'challenge', 'of', 'getting', 'everyone', 'on', 'the', 'same', 'page', 'and', 'reaching', 'a', 'consensus', 'can', 'be', 'a', 'drawback.', 'If', 'a', 'team', 'member', 'is', 'not', 'contributing', 'equally,', 'it', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'to', 'ensure', 'everyone', 'is', 'pulling', 'their', 'weight.', 'Additionally,', 'multiple', 'perspectives', 'may', 'lead', 'to', 'disagreements', 'and', 'hinder', 'decision-making.\n\nIn', 'conclusion,', 'both', 'working', 'alone', 'and', 'working', 'in', 'a', 'group', 'have', 'their', 'advantages', 'and', 'disadvantages.', 'The', 'choice', 'between', 'the', 'two', 'depends', 'on', 'the', 'nature', 'of', 'the', 'task', 'and', 'the', 'desired', 'outcome.', 'For', 'simpler', 'tasks', 'where', 'individual', 'creativity', 'is', 'key,', 'working', 'alone', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'suitable.', 'On', 'the', 'other', 'hand,', 'for', 'complex', 'projects', 'that', 'require', 'collaboration', 'and', 'diverse', 'perspectives,', 'working', 'in', 'a', 'group', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'effective.']",15,6,15.285714285714286,29,1

Through these experiences, I have come to understand the benefits of taking part in such activities, as well as the potential downfalls and strategies for managing disagreements or arguments.

One of the most significant benefits of participating in educational activities is the positive impact they have on learning. By working together with others, we are able to share ideas, collaborate on projects, and learn from one another. This not only enhances our understanding of the subject, but also helps us develop important skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication.

In addition to the learning benefits, educational activities also provide opportunities for socializing and making friends. By working together on projects and participating in group discussions, we are able to connect with others who share similar interests and values. This not only makes the learning experience more enjoyable, but also helps us build important social skills that will serve us well in the future.

However, despite the many benefits of participating in educational activities, there are also potential downfalls to be aware of. For example, disagreements and arguments can arise when individuals have different opinions or approaches to a particular task. It is important to be aware of these potential conflicts and to have strategies in place for managing them.

One effective strategy for managing disagreements is to encourage open and respectful communication. By actively listening to others and expressing our own thoughts and ideas in a clear and concise manner, we can help to foster a positive and productive group dynamic. It is also important to be open to compromise and to be willing to consider alternative viewpoints.

Another strategy for managing disagreements is to focus on the task at hand rather than getting bogged down in personal differences. By keeping the goal of the activity in mind and working together to achieve it, we can overcome any obstacles that may arise and ultimately succeed in our endeavors.

In conclusion, participating in educational activities with a group of people can have numerous benefits, including enhanced learning, socializing, and making friends.

Besides learning, these activities also give us a chance to socialize and make friends. By working together and talking in groups, we can connect with others who have similar interests. This makes learning more fun and helps us develop social skills for the future.

But even with all the benefits, there can be challenges like disagreements. It's important to be ready for conflicts and have strategies to handle them.

One good strategy is to communicate openly and respectfully. By listening to others and sharing our thoughts clearly, we can create a positive group dynamic. Being willing to compromise and consider different viewpoints is also key.

Another strategy is to focus on the task at hand instead of personal differences. By keeping our goal in mind and working together, we can overcome obstacles and succeed.

In short, participating in educational activities with a group can bring lots of benefits, like better learning and making friends. But it's important to be prepared for disagreements and have strategies in place. By communicating openly, being willing to compromise, and staying focused on the task, we can ensure our group experiences are positive and successful.",1762,0.068,0.621,0.31,0.998,0.49259740259740253,55.74,9.3,10.25810432434082,"['As', 'an', 'eighth-grade', 'student,', ""I've"", 'had', 'the', 'chance', 'to', 'join', 'in', 'on', 'educational', 'activities', 'with', 'my', 'classmates.', 'From', 'these', 'experiences,', ""I've"", 'learned', 'about', 'the', 'advantages', 'of', 'taking', 'part', 'in', 'such', 'activities,', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'how', 'to', 'handle', 'disagreements', 'or', 'arguments', 'that', 'may', 'come', 'up.\n\nOne', 'big', 'benefit', 'of', 'educational', 'activities', 'is', 'how', 'they', 'boost', 'learning.', 'By', 'working', 'together,', 'we', 'can', 'share', 'ideas,', 'collaborate', 'on', 'projects,', 'and', 'learn', 'from', 'each', 'other.', 'This', 'not', 'only', 'helps', 'us', 'understand', 'the', 'subject', 'better,', 'but', 'also', 'builds', 'skills', 'like', 'critical', 'thinking,', 'problem-solving,', 'and', 'communication.\n\nBesides', 'learning,', 'these', 'activities', 'also', 'give', 'us', 'a', 'chance', 'to', 'socialize', 'and', 'make', 'friends.', 'By', 'working', 'together', 'and', 'talking', 'in', 'groups,', 'we', 'can', 'connect', 'with', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'similar', 'interests.', 'This', 'makes', 'learning', 'more', 'fun', 'and', 'helps', 'us', 'develop', 'social', 'skills', 'for', 'the', 'future.\n\nBut', 'even', 'with', 'all', 'the', 'benefits,', 'there', 'can', 'be', 'challenges', 'like', 'disagreements.', ""It's"", 'important', 'to', 'be', 'ready', 'for', 'conflicts', 'and', 'have', 'strategies', 'to', 'handle', 'them.\n\nOne', 'good', 'strategy', 'is', 'to', 'communicate', 'openly', 'and', 'respectfully.', 'By', 'listening', 'to', 'others', 'and', 'sharing', 'our', 'thoughts', 'clearly,', 'we', 'can', 'create', 'a', 'positive', 'group', 'dynamic.', 'Being', 'willing', 'to', 'compromise', 'and', 'consider', 'different', 'viewpoints', 'is', 'also', 'key.\n\nAnother', 'strategy', 'is', 'to', 'focus', 'on', 'the', 'task', 'at', 'hand', 'instead', 'of', 'personal', 'differences.', 'By', 'keeping', 'our', 'goal', 'in', 'mind', 'and', 'working', 'together,', 'we', 'can', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'and', 'succeed.\n\nIn', 'short,', 'participating', 'in', 'educational', 'activities', 'with', 'a', 'group', 'can', 'bring', 'lots', 'of', 'benefits,', 'like', 'better', 'learning', 'and', 'making', 'friends.', 'But', ""it's"", 'important', 'to', 'be', 'prepared', 'for', 'disagreements', 'and', 'have', 'strategies', 'in', 'place.', 'By', 'communicating', 'openly,', 'being', 'willing', 'to', 'compromise,', 'and', 'staying', 'focused', 'on', 'the', 'task,', 'we', 'can', 'ensure', 'our', 'group', 'experiences', 'are', 'positive', 'and', 'successful.']",20,9,14.368421052631579,24,2

112,127565.0,"I think summer projects should be student designed. It's important for students to have the opportunity to take ownership of their learning and develop skills in self directed learning. When students are given the freedom to design their own projects, they are able to explore their interests and passions, and learn at their own pace. This can lead to a much more engaging and effective learning experience.

For example, I know a student who was really interested in photography. Ge decided to create a photography portfolio for his summer project. Ge spent the summer taking pictures of different scenes and objects, editing them, and creating a website to showcase his work. Not only did he improve his photography skills, but he also learned how to build a website, which is a valuable skill in today's digital age.

On the other hand, when teachers design summer projects, they can sometimes be too structured and rigid. Students may feel like they are being forced to work on something that doesn't interest them, which can lead to a negative learning experience. Additionally, teacher designed projects may not take into account individual students' learning styles and interests, which can result in an onesizefitsall approach that doesn't effective for everyone.

Of course, there are some potential drawbacks to student designed projects. Some students may struggle with self directed learning and may not put in enough effort or may not know where to start. In these cases, teacher guidance and support can be helpful. Teachers can provide resources and feedback to help students stay on track and ensure that their projects are rigorous and meaningful.

Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is an influential discovery in the field of emotion recognition and human communication. Developed by Professor Paul Ekman and Dr. Wallace V. Friesen in the 1970s, it serves as a comprehensive, systematic approach to identify movements and expressions on human faces. By understanding the dynamics of these facial movements and their related emotions, FACS offers significant insights into human interaction, behavior, and emotional expression.

At the heart of the Facial Action Coding System lies the importance of identifying the individual muscle movements involved in various facial expressions. The human face consists of more than 40 muscles, which can be combined to produce vast expressions. The premise of FACS is the belief that our emotional experiences and social communicatory tools can essentially be understood by studying and decoding these facial movements.

FACS categorizes facial actions into six primary types, including upper face, brow lowering, brow raising, jaw movement, lips opening, and lips parting. These primary functions can involve combined movements, as well. For example, a combination of lip corner depression and the lower lip corner depression can result in a frown, communicating sadness or displeasure.

The FACS framework is based on observational, anatomical information. It involves a step-by-step process that begins by identifying six distinct action units (AU) of the lower face. Then, an expert observer can code facial expressions into specific movement categories. Each facial movement is assigned a numerical code by examining its pattern and intensity. These facial actions are recorded and analyzed, leading to the conclusion that FACS is far more objective than relying on an interpretation approach alone.

The application of the Facial Action Coding System is multifaceted and serves several purposes. Firstly, it assists researchers studying face perception in communication science, psychology, and human development. By closely examining the variations in facial expression during social interactions, professionals can assess individuals' emotional responses and social skills, which aid in understanding human behavior better.

Additionally, FACS plays a vital role in the analysis of facial expressions shown on various electronic media. Be it in advertising, news broadcasts, or films, a filmmaker may use FACS to understand the way their actors depict specific emotions, ensuring a relatable and emotional connect with the viewer. Furthermore, as the use of virtual reality and augmented reality continues to expand in multiple industries, FACS can offer insights for realistic human-like expressions in digital character depictions in VR, AR, or video games.

Another key aspect of FACS is its use in investigating deceptive interactions and emotional expressions. By analyzing the distinct variations in facial movements during a lie or an act of deception, researchers can explore the significance of non-verbal cues in communication and develop more effective strategies to detect deception. This is relevant in clinical settings, witness interviews, and forensic investigations.

Moreover, the understanding of facial movements can have a direct impact on the advancement of robotics, artificial intelligence, and virtual assistants. As these technologies continue to evolve in their ability to exhibit humanlike behavior and emotions, studies in FACS can provide valuable insights for improving the authenticity of AI-driven human-like interactions, thereby making these virtual agents more relatable and user-friendly.

Last but not least, the Facial Action Coding System has made significant contributions to the medical field, particularly in research related to stroke rehabilitation and facial paralysis. By closely analyzing facial movements and expressions after such events, professionals can develop more effective rehabilitation techniques and improve the overall patient care for those suffering from facial paralysis or issues with their expressive faces.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is an essential analytical framework that allows researchers, clinicians, and designers to identify and understand the complexities of human facial expression. By closely examining the variations in facial movements in various contexts, FACS paves the way for significant improvements in emotional recognition, communication, and human-machine interaction, thereby bringing us closer to a world where machines can understand and mimic human facial expressions more effectively.

Distracted driving is a leading cause of accidents in many countries, with cell phone use playing a significant role in this problem.

Cell phone use while driving also slows reaction time. When you're driving, you need to be able to react quickly to unexpected situations. However, if you're distracted by a conversation or texting, you may not be able to react as fast as you would if you were fully focused on the road. This can lead to accidents that are not worth the risk.

There are safer and more responsible ways to communicate while driving. For example, you can use hands-free devices or Bluetooth technology to make and receive calls without handling your phone. Alternatively, you can pull over to a safe location to take a call. These options are much safer than using a cell phone while driving.

Allowing drivers to use cell phones while driving sets a bad example for young drivers. As a ninth grade student, I am still learning to drive and look up to experienced drivers as role models. If I see them using their cell phones while driving, it sends a message that it's okay to do so. This can be confusing and frustrating for young drivers who are trying to learn safe driving practices.

In conclusion, drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any way while driving. It's a distraction, impairs reaction time, there are safer alternatives, and it sets a bad example for young drivers. As a society, we need to prioritize safety on our roads, and banning cell phone use while driving is a necessary step towards achieving this goal.",1993,0.129,0.752,0.119,-0.6196,0.5830459770114943,70.63,7.8,8.270502090454102,"['As', 'a', 'ninth', 'grade', 'student,', 'I', 'strongly', 'believe', 'that', 'drivers', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'to', 'use', 'cell', 'phones', 'in', 'any', 'way', 'while', 'driving.', 'This', 'may', 'sound', 'extreme,', 'but', 'I', 'think', ""it's"", 'important', 'to', 'ensure', 'the', 'safety', 'of', 'everyone', 'on', 'the', 'road.\n\nUsing', 'a', 'cell', 'phone', 'while', 'driving', 'is', 'a', 'major', 'distraction.', 'Texting,', 'checking', 'social', 'media,', 'or', 'even', 'talking', 'on', 'the', 'phone', 'takes', 'your', 'eyes', 'and', 'focus', 'off', 'the', 'road,', 'increasing', 'the', 'risk', 'of', 'accidents', 'and', 'near', 'misses.', 'Distracted', 'driving', 'is', 'a', 'leading', 'cause', 'of', 'accidents', 'in', 'many', 'countries,', 'with', 'cell', 'phone', 'use', 'playing', 'a', 'significant', 'role', 'in', 'this', 'problem.\n\nCell', 'phone', 'use', 'while', 'driving', 'also', 'slows', 'reaction', 'time.', 'When', ""you're"", 'driving,', 'you', 'need', 'to', 'be', 'able', 'to', 'react', 'quickly', 'to', 'unexpected', 'situations.', 'However,', 'if', ""you're"", 'distracted', 'by', 'a', 'conversation', 'or', 'texting,', 'you', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'to', 'react', 'as', 'fast', 'as', 'you', 'would', 'if', 'you', 'were', 'fully', 'focused', 'on', 'the', 'road.', 'This', 'can', 'lead', 'to', 'accidents', 'that', 'are', 'not', 'worth', 'the', 'risk.\n\nThere', 'are', 'safer', 'and', 'more', 'responsible', 'ways', 'to', 'communicate', 'while', 'driving.', 'For', 'example,', 'you', 'can', 'use', 'hands-free', 'devices', 'or', 'Bluetooth', 'technology', 'to', 'make', 'and', 'receive', 'calls', 'without', 'handling', 'your', 'phone.', 'Alternatively,', 'you', 'can', 'pull', 'over', 'to', 'a', 'safe', 'location', 'to', 'take', 'a', 'call.', 'These', 'options', 'are', 'much', 'safer', 'than', 'using', 'a', 'cell', 'phone', 'while', 'driving.\n\nAllowing', 'drivers', 'to', 'use', 'cell', 'phones', 'while', 'driving', 'sets', 'a', 'bad', 'example', 'for', 'young', 'drivers.', 'As', 'a', 'ninth', 'grade', 'student,', 'I', 'am', 'still', 'learning', 'to', 'drive', 'and', 'look', 'up', 'to', 'experienced', 'drivers', 'as', 'role', 'models.', 'If', 'I', 'see', 'them', 'using', 'their', 'cell', 'phones', 'while', 'driving,', 'it', 'sends', 'a', 'message', 'that', ""it's"", 'okay', 'to', 'do', 'so.', 'This', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'and', 'frustrating', 'for', 'young', 'drivers', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'to', 'learn', 'safe', 'driving', 'practices.\n\nIn', 'conclusion,', 'drivers', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'to', 'use', 'cell', 'phones', 'in', 'any', 'way', 'while', 'driving.', ""It's"", 'a', 'distraction,', 'impairs', 'reaction', 'time,', 'there', 'are', 'safer', 'alternatives,', 'and', 'it', 'sets', 'a', 'bad', 'example', 'for', 'young', 'drivers.', 'As', 'a', 'society,', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'prioritize', 'safety', 'on', 'our', 'roads,', 'and', 'banning', 'cell', 'phone', 'use', 'while', 'driving', 'is', 'a', 'necessary', 'step', 'towards', 'achieving', 'this', 'goal.']",24,10,16.428571428571427,43,1
119,27085.0,"We have all heard about the importance of recycling for protecting the environment, but one area where this is especially true is in regards to reducing plastic waste. Plastic has become such a ubiquitous part of our lives that it’s easy to overlook its environmental impact. From disposable water bottles and packaging materials, to single-use containers and plastic bags – every bit of plastic we throw away ends up as non-biodegradable trash in landfills or oceans. Unfortunately, plastic can remain intact for hundreds of years!. Recycling reduces our dependence on oil (the primary source used to make most plastics). By taking old products and giving them “new life"" through reuse or remanufacturing into new items, we are able to reduce the amount of energy needed to produce these same types of items from scratch. Additionally, by diverting waste from landfills and incinerators we avoid emissions associated with their destruction. Instead those resources get diverted towards creating useful products which can help offset some production costs while avoiding further pollution risk due to burning fossil fuels or producing more plastics from crude oil sources. In order for us to truly benefit from recycling efforts however requires everyone’s participation! Taking just small steps such as refusing single-use plastics like straws when eating out; bringing your own reusable shopping bags; buying bulk food instead of individually wrapped packages; participating in curbside collection programs if available; properly sorting recyclables before dropping them off at locations designated for such collections etc., will go a long way towards helping preserve our environment and keep hazardous material out of nature's fragile ecosystems. Even better would be engaging in buyback programs offered by local stores which allow you not only recycle but actually receive money back based upon how much weight your returned recyclables contain - thus incentivizing people even furtherto take part in green initiatives!. Overall, recycling helps create jobs while preserving natural resources necessary for future generations so it’s important

120,104805.0,"As an eighth grade student, I have learned the importance of seeking multiple options when making a decision. In my opinion, seeking multiple options is a crucial step in the decision making process, as it allows individuals to weigh all their options and make the best decision possible. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of seeking multiple options when making a decision.

First and foremost, seeking multiple options allows individuals to make an informed decision. When making a decision, it is easy to overlook important factors or to be biased towards one option. However, by seeking multiple options, individuals can gather more information and make a more informed decision. For example, if a student is deciding which college to attend, seeking multiple options would involve researching different colleges and universities, reading reviews, and speaking with current students or alumni. By gathering this information, the student can make a more informed decision about which college to attend.

Secondly, seeking multiple options allows individuals to consider all possible outcomes. When making a decision, it is easy to focus on the immediate benefits of one option, while ignoring the potential drawbacks. However, by seeking multiple options, individuals can consider all possible outcomes and make a decision that is not only beneficial, but also sustainable. For example, if a student is deciding which extracurricular activity to join, seeking multiple options would involve researching different activities and considering the time commitment, cost, and potential benefits. By considering all possible outcomes, the student can make a decision that is not only enjoyable, but also sustainable in the long run.

Lastly, seeking multiple options allows individuals to broaden their perspective. When making a decision, it is easy to become narrow minded and focus only on one option. However, by seeking multiple options, individuals can broaden their perspective and consider alternative viewpoints. For example, if a student is deciding which major to pursue, seeking multiple options would involve researching different majors and speaking with individuals in those fields. By considering alternative viewpoints, the student can make a decision that is not only aligned with their interests, but also has the potential for growth and development.

In conclusion, seeking multiple options when making a decision is crucial for making an informed, sustainable, and well rounded decision. By gathering information, considering all possible outcomes, and broadening their perspective, individuals can make decisions that are not only beneficial in the short term, but also in the",1.0," long term. It is important to take the time to explore all options before making a decision, as this can lead to better outcomes and a deeper understanding of the choices available.",182,0.0,0.856,0.144,0.5719,0.575,47.46,14.6,13.91948413848877,"['', 'long', 'term.', 'It', 'is', 'important', 'to', 'take', 'the', 'time', 'to', 'explore', 'all', 'options', 'before', 'making', 'a', 'decision,', 'as', 'this', 'can', 'lead', 'to', 'better', 'outcomes', 'and', 'a', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'of', 'the', 'choices', 'available.']",1,0,11.0,4,0

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my thoughts and concerns regarding the Electoral College and whether it should be retained or changed to a popular vote system in the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information presented in the provided texts, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept for the following reasons:

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. Zs stated in Judge Richard Z. Poster's article, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely to occur than a dispute over the popular vote. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College is typically higher than their share of the popular vote, ensuring a clear victor. This helps to avoid political gridlock and potential legal battles that could arise from close popular vote margins.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President is ""everyone's President,"" as Judge Poster points out. With its requirement for transregional appeal, the Electoral College prevents candidates with only regional favoritism from winning the presidency. This is crucial in a diverse nation like ours because a president elected via popular vote may not necessarily represent the interests and concerns of all regions equally. By requiring broad support across multiple states, the Electoral College ensures that the President governs with a national perspective.

Thirdly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states. One of the main criticisms of the Electoral College is that it leads to candidates exclusively focusing on a few swing states during their campaigns. However, this also means that voters in those crucial states receive the most attention and information from the candidates. These voters are likely to be more informed and thoughtful, which ultimately benefits the democratic process.

Fourthly, the Electoral College provides a balance of power for big states. It is no secret that large states hold significant political influence due to their population size. However, the Electoral College allows smaller states to have a proportional say by granting them more electoral votes per capita. This prevents large states from dominating the political landscape and ensures that candidates must appeal to a diverse range of states and communities during their campaigns.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for runoff elections. With this system in place, there is a reduced likelihood of multiple candidates running with no clear majority winner. This eliminates the need for costly and time consuming runoff elections, allowing for a smoother transition of power and maintaining the stability of the presidential election process.

While some argue that a popular vote system would be more fair and democratic, it is important to consider the potential disadvantages. Zs mentioned in Bradford Plume's article, a popular vote system could lead to a disastrous outcome, such as when state legislatures have the power to select electors. It also has the potential to disenfranchise voters in regions that have no chance of electing a president, leading to a decrease in voter turnout.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College provides an effective and balanced method of electing the President of the United States. It ensures certainty of outcome, prevents regional favoritism, encourages candidates to appeal to a broader range of states, balances power between large and small states, and avoids the need for runoff elections. While no system is perfect, the Electoral College offers greater stability and representation for all citizens. Therefore, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will carefully weigh the information provided and make the best decision for our state and our nation.

It isn't difficult for one to imagine what life can be like without cars in urban areas. Car-free cities might seem like science fiction at some level or even an impractical dreamer's aspiration, but it's necessary to think about its benefits and discuss its possibilities. After all, the world's urban population, and consequently the demand for personal vehicles, rideshares, and public transport systems, can only continue to increase into the future. The question is not whether a car-free city would survive, but what would it look like?

There is a great deal of debate surrounding the practical aspects of car-free cities. While a complete ban on car usage might be overreaching and unrealistic, we can still explore the possibility of implementing gradual changes or focusing on certain essential elements that can make a significant impact on making cities more walkable, bikeable, and transit-oriented. 

Efficiency has often been stated as the primary factor pushing automobile traffic and its negative impact on a city. With an exponential rise in vehicle demand leading to increased traffic jams, congestion, air and noise pollution, there is a need for a sustainable alternative.

One possible measure to make cities more car-dependent is through the improvement of cycling and walking facilities. This implies not just installing bike lanes and widening pavements but also creating distinct 'complete streets.' A complete street is envisioned as a thoroughfare where pedestrians, public transit users, bicyclists, and drivers must safely share the same space with an equal emphasis placed on safety and convenience. This way, it ensures that a wide variety of users have equal access to transportation options and is more environmentally friendly as well. 

Another aspect to consider is the importance of effective public transportation systems. Investment in high-quality bus and rail infrastructure coupled with ride-sharing solutions could play a vital role in replacing vehicles. This not only reduces congestion on roads but also opens new avenues for city exploration. It is significant to think in the long-term with regard to transportation choices and planning urban landscapes in a way that promotes the prioritization of public transportation over private vehicles.

Furthermore, it is important to consider the potential environmental and social benefits that come along with a decrease in dependency on cars. With more emphasis on walkable and bikeable spaces, residents can have greater control over their daily routes, exercising and communing more with their surroundings. This lifestyle change can contribute significantly towards promoting a healthier society and a more inclusive environment within urban areas. 

In car-free cities, the community structure would need to be designed with more emphasis on pedestrian areas and green spaces. These public spaces can be transformed in such a way that encourages encounters between neighbors, fosters a sense of community, and promotes social interaction. Additionally, city planners could create areas focusing on green spaces that also integrate water features and recreational facilities for the entire community to enjoy, thus promoting a healthy mix of nature, exercise, and leisure. 

In terms of city planning and urban architecture, the adoption of car-free cities presents an enormous opportunity to address the growing demand for housing. The absence of car parking requirements allows for more compact and space-efficient building designs with increased density and functionality, which is a crucial factor for accommodating urban growth while maintaining walkable, bikeable communities.

To achieve this urban transformation, the role of real estate developers, urban planners, politicians, and citizens alike must be prioritized. It is necessary to engage the public in sustainable urban planning and provide adequate incentive programs to encourage adoption of these new lifestyle habits. This can be done by organizing talks, educational programs, and awareness campaigns that convey benefits associated with the adoption of alternative modes of transport, and the importance of adopting behaviors and attitudes that prioritize environment and people over the convenience of cars.

In summary, the idea of car-free cities is not simply about eliminating cars but rather seeking to reimagine transportation and city life by embracing more environmentally friendly, walking, bikeable, and transit-oriented measures. It highlights the importance of a more humane and sustainable approach in designing urban spaces to cater to the needs of modern residents. While car-free urban centers might appear as utopian or unrealistic now, it is through strategic planning, collective efforts, and an evolving mindset that we can strive for an eco-conscious, inclusive, and more people-centric future for our urban centers.",1.0,"Imagining a world without cars in cities may seem like a far-fetched idea, but it's important to consider the benefits and possibilities.

This can help reduce traffic congestion, pollution, and noise while promoting a healthier lifestyle.

Improving cycling and walking facilities, creating 'complete streets,' and investing in high-quality public transportation systems are key steps towards reducing car dependency. By prioritizing public transportation over private vehicles, we can create a more inclusive and environmentally friendly urban environment. Encouraging residents to walk and bike more can lead to a healthier society and stronger sense of community.

Extending the School Day: Yay or Nay?

As an 8th grader, I think it's pretty cool when we get to sleep in an extra hour on Fridays. But, have you ever thought about extending the school day? Like, what if we went to school for six hours instead of five? I know, I know, it sounds like a lot, but hear me out.

So, the pros of extending the school day are pretty cool. For one, we would get more learning time. I mean, who doesn't love learning? And, if we got more time in the classroom, we could probably learn more stuff. Plus, it would give us more time to do stuff like sports and clubs, which are super fun. And, think about it, if we went to school for six hours instead of five, we would have more time to hang out with our friends. Like, we could sit together at lunch and stuff.

But, there are also some cons to extending the school day. For one, it would be really hard to get up early if we had to be at school for six hours. Like, I know some people don't like getting up early, and if we had to be at school for longer, it would be even harder. Plus, some people might not be able to do after school stuff like sports and clubs if they have to be at school for longer. And, think about it, if we went to school for six hours, we would probably be exhausted and grumpy. Like, who wants to be grumpy all day?

So, in conclusion, I think extending the school day could be good, but it could also be bad. It's like, it could give us more time to learn and hang out with our friends, but it could also be super hard and make us grumpy. So, I don't know if I would want to extend the school day.

There are some pretty cool advantages to extending the school day. First off, we would have more time for learning. Who doesn't love learning, right? With more time in the classroom, we could probably cover more material. It would also give us more time for activities like sports and clubs, which are a blast. And just think, with a longer school day, we could have more time to hang out with our friends, like sitting together at lunch.

On the flip side, there are some downsides to extending the school day. Waking up early would be even tougher if we had to be at school for six hours. Some people struggle with early mornings, and adding more time at school could make it even harder. Plus, some students might not be able to participate in after-school activities if the day is longer. And let's face it, being at school for six hours might leave us feeling tired and irritable.

128,72992.0,"When making decisions, it is important to consider multiple ideas and perspectives. Seeking out the opinions of others can provide valuable insights and lead to a more informed decision. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of seeking multiple ideas and provide examples of when this approach has led to the right decision.

One of the main benefits of seeking multiple ideas is that it allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. When we only consider our own perspective, we may be missing out on important information that could affect our decision. By talking to others and hearing their thoughts, we can gain a better understanding of the situation and make a more informed decision.

For example, when deciding on a college major, it can be helpful to talk to friends, family, and even counselors about their experiences and advice. By considering the opinions of others, we can gain a better understanding of the different majors available and which one may be the best fit for us. This approach can lead to a more informed decision and ultimately, a more successful outcome.

Another benefit of seeking multiple ideas is that it allows for a more balanced decision. When we only consider our own perspective, we may be biased towards our own preferences and ignore the potential drawbacks of our decision. By hearing the opinions of others, we can gain a more balanced perspective and make a decision that takes into account all relevant factors.

For example, when deciding on a new job opportunity, it can be helpful to talk to colleagues and friends who have worked in similar roles. By considering the opinions of others, we can gain a better understanding of the job's responsibilities, the company culture, and the potential drawbacks of the position. This approach can lead to a more balanced decision and ultimately, a more successful outcome.

Finally, seeking multiple ideas can also lead to a more innovative and creative decision. When we only consider our own perspective, we may be limited by our own experiences and ideas. By hearing the opinions of others, we can gain new insights and perspectives that we may not have considered otherwise. This approach can lead to a more innovative and creative decision that takes into account a wider range of ideas and perspectives.

Some people might say that young people are too busy with their own lives and do not have enough time to help others, while others might argue that there are many young people who are very active in their communities.

I believe that, overall, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. This is partly due to the Act that young people are busy with their own lives – they are in school, they are working, and they are trying to establish themselves in their careers. However, I think there is also a lack oi awareness among young people about the importance oi helping others.

One oi the main reasons why it is important IOR young people to help their communities is that it can help them to develop important skills and values. Volunteering allows young people to learn about teamwork, communication, and leadership. It also teaches them about the importance oi giving back to society, and helps them to develop a sense oi civic responsibility.

Another reason why it is important IOR young people to help their communities is that it can help to address some oi the world’s biggest problems. For example, young people can play a role in addressing issues such as poverty, climate change, and human rights abuses.

Finally, I think it is important IOR young people to help their communities because it can make them Feel connected to their communities and to other people. Volunteering can help young people to make new Friends and to develop relationships with people who share their interests. It can also help them to Feel more connected to their community, and to Feel like they are a part oi something larger than themselves.

In conclusion, I believe that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. However, I also believe that there is potential IOR young people to make a big impact by volunteering their time and skills. I hope that more young people will become aware oi the importance oi helping others, and that they will be inspired to get involved in their communities.

",1.0,"There is no clear answer to whether young people today dedicate sufficient time to supporting their communities. Some argue that young people are too preoccupied with their own lives to help others, while others believe that many young individuals are actively involved in their communities.

In my opinion, young people generally do not devote enough time to community service. This is partly because they are busy with school, work, and building their careers. Additionally, there seems to be a lack of awareness among young people about the significance of assisting others.

It is crucial for young people to engage in community service as it helps them develop essential skills and values. Volunteering teaches teamwork, communication, and leadership, while emphasizing the importance of giving back to society and fostering a sense of civic duty.

Furthermore, supporting their communities enables young people to address major global issues such as poverty, climate change, and human rights violations.

Ultimately, contributing to their communities helps young people feel connected to others and their surroundings. Volunteering can lead to new friendships, shared interests, and a sense of belonging to something greater than themselves.

While the truth of this statement largely depends on the individual’s personality, experiences, and expectations regarding the particular person or situation they are encountering, it often holds true that a person’s initial impressions of something or someone can be hard to change. For example, if a person first sees another person they deem as unapproachable, unfriendly, or unkind, it may be quite difficult to convince them to give that person a second chance. This becomes especially true when the negative first impression is based on physical appearances, preexisting prejudices, or any type of prior knowledge of the person/situation in question.  

Xn the other hand, there are also instances when first impressions are not necessarily set in stone and can be changed with deliberate effort and the willingness to look past one’s initial judgment.

With the right attitude and a readiness to learn and understand, it is possible to modify one’s first impressions and develop a more accurate evaluation of the person or situation in question.

However, there is more to success than simply continuing to do what we already know how to do. To truly reach success, it is important to be willing to try new things and take risks.

INE of the most important aspects of success is being able to adapt to new situations. If we only do what we already know how to do, we can become stuck in a rut and fail to recognize new opportunities that arise. By trying new things and taking risks, we open ourselves up to new possibilities and a wider range of experiences. This can lead to creative solutions to problems and can also help us to develop new skills.

For example, entrepreneur Elon Musk started out as a software engineer and programmer. He was successful in this field, but he wanted to go further. He decided to take a risk and branch out into new areas. Furthermore, he started new companies, such as SpaceX and Tesla, and was willing to try new things to make them successful. His willingness to take risks has paid off, and his companies are now some of the most successful in the world.

Taking risks can also help us to learn more about ourselves. We may discover new talents or strengths that we never would have if we had stayed in our comfort zone. By trying something new or taking a risk, we can also become more confident in our abilities. This can be a great asset when it comes to success.

If coursed, it is important to be aware of the risks that come with trying new things. We should make sure that we are aware of the potential consequences of our actions before taking a risk. It is also important to know when to take a risk and when to stay safe.

One of the key components of success is the ability to adapt to new circumstances. If we only stick to what we are familiar with, we may miss out on new opportunities that come our way. By stepping out of our comfort zone and taking risks, we expose ourselves to a wider range of experiences and possibilities. This can lead to innovative problem-solving and the development of new skills.

For instance, entrepreneur Elon Musk initially worked as a software engineer and programmer. While successful in this field, he decided to take a leap of faith and venture into new territories. By starting companies like SpaceX and Tesla and being open to trying new approaches, he has achieved remarkable success. His willingness to take risks has paid off, making his companies among the most successful globally.

Taking risks can also help us discover hidden talents and strengths that we may not have realized if we had stayed within our comfort zone. By embracing new challenges, we can boost our confidence and enhance our chances of success.

I think we should keep the Electoral College. I know some people think it's unfair, but I think it's important. If we didn't have the Electoral College, the president would just be chosen by the people who live in the biggest cities. That wouldn't be fair to people who live in smaller places.

Firstly, problems provide a challenge that pushes us to thing critically and creatively. When we encounter a problem, we are forced to analyze it and come up with a solution. This process of problem solving helps us develop our analytical and decision-making swills. For example, when I was working on a science project, I encountered a problem with the experiment not producing the expected results. Instead of giving up, I researched and came up with a new hypothesis that led to a successful outcome. This experience taught me the importance of perseverance and not giving up in the face of challenges.

Secondly, problems allow us to learn from our mistakes and improve ourselves. When we made a mistake, it is an opportunity to reflect on what went wrong and how we can do better next time. This process of self reflection helps us grow as individuals and become more resilient. For example, when I struggled with a math problem, I asked my teacher for help and learned a new technique that made the problem much easier to solve. This experience taught me the importance of asking for help and not being afraid to learn from my mistakes.

Finally, problems can lead to unexpected outcomes that we may not have achieved if we had not encountered the problem in the first place. For example, when I was working on a group project in history, we encountered a problem with one of our sources. Instead of giving up, we decided to do additional research and found a new source that provided a more in depth perspective on the topic.

The FACS system was initially created by Carl-Herman Hjortsjö and Walter Fries in the early 20th century. The system is based on a classification of 43 facial actions that can occur in various combinations to form complex human emotions and expressions. These actions are divided into seven primary facial muscle movements: 
1. Raise brows
2. Lower brows
3. Furrow forehead
4. Pucker lips
5. Stretch lips
6. Pull corners of lips back (smiling)
7. Tense jaw muscles

Each facial action is further divided into sub-actions based on intensity or duration. For instance, ""Raise brows"" can be divided into ""Slight raise,"" ""Moderate raise,"" and ""Strong raise.""

144,132586.0," Care Senator,

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the current system for electing the President of the United States. While I understand the arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote, I believe the Electoral College provides several key benefits that make it a more effective and fair way to elect the President.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures that every vote counts. Under a popular vote system, a candidate could win the presidency by winning a narrow margin of votes in a few swing states, while losing the election overall. This would mean that millions of voters would have their voices ignored, as their vote would not have affected the outcome of the election. In contrast, the Electoral College provides a more balanced system in which every state's electoral votes are given equal weight, regardless of the size of the state's population. This ensures that every vote is counted and that the President is elected by the entire country, not just a few key swing states.

Second, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign nationally, rather than just focusing on a few key states. When candidates know that they need to win over voters in every state, they are incentivized to work hard and appeal to voters across the country. This ensures that the President is elected by the entire country, not just a few key regions or interest groups. In contrast, under a popular vote system, candidates may be incentivized to focus solely on a few key swing states, ignoring the needs and concerns of voters in other parts of the country.

Third, the Electoral College provides a mechanism for checking the power of large, urban states. In a popular vote system, states with large population centers would have a disproportionate amount of influence over the election, as their votes would be given more weight than those of smaller, rural states. This could lead to a situation where the President is elected by a few large, urban states, while ignoring the needs and concerns of the rest of the country.

Finally, the Electoral College provides a mechanism for resolving ties in the election. In a popular vote system, a tie would require a runoff election, which could be chaotic and uncertain.

In conclusion, while there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system for electing the President, I believe the Elector",1.0,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the current system for electing the President of the United States. While I understand the arguments for switching to a popular vote, I believe the Electoral College has several important benefits that make it a more effective and fair way to elect the President.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures that every vote matters. With a popular vote system, a candidate could win by a small margin in a few swing states, disregarding the overall election results. This would mean that many voters would have their voices ignored, as their votes would not impact the outcome. In contrast, the Electoral College gives equal weight to every state's electoral votes, ensuring that every vote counts and the President is elected by the entire country.

Secondly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign nationwide, rather than focusing on a few key states. When candidates know they need support from all states, they are motivated to work hard and appeal to voters across the country. This ensures that the President represents the entire nation, not just specific regions or interest groups. In contrast, a popular vote system may lead candidates to concentrate solely on swing states, neglecting other parts of the country.

Thirdly, the Electoral College helps balance the power of large, urban states. In a popular vote system, states with large populations would have more influence, potentially leading to the neglect of smaller, rural states. The Electoral College prevents this by giving each state's electoral votes equal weight, regardless of population size.

Lastly, the Electoral College provides a way to resolve ties in the election without the need for a runoff. In a popular vote system, a tie would require a chaotic runoff election. The Electoral College resolves ties by having the House of Representatives choose the President, ensuring that the entire country is represented in the decision.

145,157653.0," School can be a challenging environment for students, especially when they are surrounded by distractions from their peers. While attending school allows for socialization and nourishment, it can be difficult for a student to show up or focus on their studies. AOR me, I would rather work on my assignments and other tasks that my teacher assigns at home. There are several reasons why I believe that working from home can be beneficial for a student.

Firstly, some students may not be able to focus on their studies due to distractions from their peers. This can be particularly challenging when a student is causing a lot of noise, making it difficult for others to concentrate on their assignments. Additionally, some students may live far from the school, which can make it challenging to attend school regularly. Working from home can eliminate these distractions and allow students to focus on their studies without interruption.

Secondly, students can limit distractions at home in several ways. Aor's example, they can put on headphones to relax and work hard while listening to music. Some teachers may dislike when students have their phones out or listen to music while studying, but every student has a different way of studying, and one student might be more focused if they listen to music while working or studying. This also makes the student feel more relaxed that they can listen to music.

Thirdly, working from home can be beneficial for students who are always trying to make a joke or be the center of attention. These students can cause problems for other students who are trying to work or study, making it difficult for them to focus on their tasks. Working from home can eliminate these distractions and allow students to focus on their studies without interruption.

Finally, working from home can be beneficial for students who live far from the school. Without a reliable ride to and from school, students may arrive late, which can make it challenging to study or work on assignments. Working from home eliminates this distraction and allows students to focus on their studies without worrying about transportation.

In conclusion, working from home can be beneficial for students who may struggle to focus on their studies due to distractions from their peers. By eliminating these distractions, students can focus on their studies and complete their assignments more efficiently. Additionally, students who live far from the school can benefit from working from home, as it eliminates the stress of transportation and allows them",1.0," to focus on their studies without worrying about being late.

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. I believe that this change would be more fair and democratic, and would give all Americans a voice in our government.

The Electoral College is a system that was created in the 18th century, when the United States was a much smaller country. At that time, it was important to have a system that gave equal representation to all states, regardless of their population. However, the United States has changed dramatically since then. Today, we are a country of over 330 million people, and the Electoral College no longer serves its original purpose.

In fact, the Electoral College now actually works against the interests of many Americans. In recent elections, we have seen candidates who have won the popular vote but lost the election. This is because the Electoral College gives more power to voters in small states than to voters in large states.

This is unfair to many Americans, who feel that their votes do not matter. It is also undemocratic, as it means that the President is not necessarily chosen by the majority of the people.

I believe that the best way to fix this problem is to abolish the Electoral College and elect the President by popular vote. This would ensure that every American's vote counts, and that the President is chosen by the majority of the people.

149,27891.0,"The automobile has been a staple of American life for over a century. It has allowed us to travel long distances quickly and conveniently, and it has played a major role in shaping our country's development. However, the automobile has also had a number of negative consequences, including air pollution, traffic congestion, and urban sprawl. In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage and promote alternative forms of transportation.

There are several reasons why limiting car usage is a good idea. First, cars contribute to air pollution. When cars burn gasoline, they release emissions into the air that can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. In fact, the transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Second, cars cause traffic congestion. When everyone drives their own car, it can create a lot of traffic, which can make it difficult to get around. This can lead to delays, frustration, and even accidents. Third, cars contribute to urban sprawl. As more and more people move out of cities and into suburbs, they need to drive to get around. This can lead to the development of low-density, car-dependent suburbs that are not very sustainable.

There are a number of things that can be done to limit car usage. One way is to improve public transportation. This can make it easier for people to get around without a car. Another way is to build more bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. This can encourage people to walk or bike instead of driving. Finally, we can make it more expensive to drive by raising gas taxes or implementing congestion pricing. This can discourage people from driving and encourage them to find alternative ways to get around.

Limiting car usage has a number of benefits. It can improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and make cities more sustainable. It can also improve people's health and well-being. When people don't have to drive, they have more time to exercise, relax, and spend time with their families. They may also be less likely to suffer from stress, obesity, and other health problems associated with a sedentary lifestyle.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why limiting car usage is a good idea. It can improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, make cities more sustainable, and improve people's health and well-being.

150,206997.0,"I am in favor of transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. There are several reasons why I believe this transition is necessary and beneficial for our society.

Firstly, fossil fuels are finite resources that will eventually run out. The world's oil reserves, for example, are estimated to last only another 50 years or so at current consumption rates. In contrast, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower are virtually limitless and can be harnessed indefinitely. By transitioning to these sustainable energy sources, we can ensure a steady supply of energy for future generations without depleting our planet's natural resources.

Secondly, the use of fossil fuels has significant negative impacts on the environment. Burning coal, oil, and gas releases harmful pollutants into the air, contributing to climate change, acid rain, and respiratory diseases. Renewable energy sources, on the other hand, produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions and have a much smaller environmental footprint. For instance, solar panels do not emit any pollutants during operation, and wind turbines have been shown to have minimal impacts on local wildlife.

Lastly, investing in renewable energy can create new jobs and stimulate economic growth. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the renewable energy sector employed over 11 million people worldwide in 2018. As more countries shift towards renewable energy, there will be an increasing demand for skilled workers in fields such as engineering, installation, and maintenance. This transition can also lead to increased energy independence and reduced reliance on foreign oil, which can have positive geopolitical implications.

In conclusion, the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is necessary for the long term sustainability of our planet and offers numerous economic and environmental benefits. While there may be some initial costs associated with this transition, the long term gains far outweigh any short term expenses. We must continue to invest in and promote the use of renewable energy sources to ensure a brighter future for ourselves and future generations.",1.0,"I strongly support the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources for a variety of reasons.

The renewable energy sector already employs millions of people worldwide, and as more countries adopt renewable energy, there will be a growing need for skilled workers. This transition can also enhance energy independence and reduce reliance on foreign oil, which has positive geopolitical implications.

In summary, transitioning to renewable energy is crucial for the sustainability of our planet and offers numerous economic and environmental benefits. While there may be initial costs involved, the long-term advantages outweigh any short-term expenses.

151,41318.0,"Hey there! I know you're really into the idea that aliens created the Face on Mars, but let me tell you, as a NASA scientist, I'm here to convinced you that it's just a natural landform. I know, I know, it looks like a face, but sometimes nature can be pretty clever. In this essay, I'll explain why I think the Face is just a regular ol' hill.

Claim 1: The Face is just a hill with shadows.
The article states that ""the Face is simply a hill with a particularly symmetrical arrangement of shadows"" (Paragraph 3). This means that when the sun shines on the hill, it creates shadows that make it look like a face. It's like when you see a rabbit in the clouds - it's just a trick of the light! If you look at the picture in the article, you can see that the ""face"" is actually just a bunch of shadows and highlights.

Claim 2: The Face is made of natural materials.
The article also mentions that the Face is made of ""a hill of rock and soil"" (Paragraph 2). This means that it's not some weird, alien material - it's just regular old Earth stuff. And, as the article points out, ""the soil and rocks found on Mars are similar to those found on Earth"" (Paragraph 4). So, it's not like aliens came down and dumped some strange, face-making material on the planet. It's just nature doing its thing.

Claim 3: Other natural features on Mars look like faces too.
The article talks about how other natural features on Mars also look like faces (Paragraph 5). This means that it's not just the Face that looks like a face - other things on the planet do too! It's like how you might see a face in a cloud or a tree trunk. It's just our brains being silly and seeing patterns where there aren't any.

Evidence from the article to support my claims:

* ""the Face is simply a hill with a particularly symmetrical arrangement of shadows"" (Paragraph 3)
* ""the soil and rocks found on Mars are similar to those found on Earth"" (Paragraph 4)
* ""other natural features on Mars also look like faces"" (Paragraph 5)
So, there you have it! The Face on Mars might look like a face, but it's actually just a natural landform. It's made of regular stuff like rocks and soil, and it's just a trick of the light that makes it look like a face. I hope I've convinced you that there's no need to call in the aliens - it's just good old Mother Nature doing her thing.",1.0,"Hey there! I understand you're really into the theory that aliens created the Face on Mars, but as a NASA scientist, I'm here to explain why it's actually just a natural landform. I know it looks like a face, but nature can be pretty clever sometimes. In this essay, I'll detail why I believe the Face is simply a regular hill.

Argument 1: The Face is essentially a hill with shadows.
The article suggests that ""the Face is essentially a hill with a particularly symmetrical arrangement of shadows"" (Paragraph 3). This means that when sunlight hits the hill, it creates shadows that give the appearance of a face. It's similar to seeing shapes in clouds - just a play of light! By examining the image in the article, you can see that the ""face"" is primarily shadows and highlights.

Argument 2: The Face is composed of natural materials.
The article notes that the Face is made of ""a hill of rock and soil"" (Paragraph 2). This indicates that it's not some strange, alien substance - it's just typical Earth materials. Additionally, the article mentions that ""the soil and rocks found on Mars are similar to those found on Earth"" (Paragraph 4). Therefore, it's unlikely that aliens deposited unique materials to create the face. It's simply a result of natural processes.

Argument 3: Other natural features on Mars resemble faces as well.
The article discusses how other natural features on Mars also resemble faces (Paragraph 5). This suggests that it's not just the Face that appears face-like - other features on the planet do too! It's akin to seeing faces in clouds or tree trunks. Our brains tend to find patterns where they may not exist.

Supporting evidence from the article:

* ""the Face is essentially a hill with a particularly symmetrical arrangement of shadows"" (Paragraph 3)
* ""the soil and rocks found on Mars are similar to those found on Earth"" (Paragraph 4)
* ""other natural features on Mars also resemble faces"" (Paragraph 5)

In conclusion, the Face on Mars may resemble a face, but it's actually a natural landform. It's comprised of typical materials like rocks and soil, and its appearance as a face is merely a result of light and shadow. Hopefully, I've convinced you that there's no need to attribute the Face to aliens - it's simply nature at work.",2277,0.037,0.819,0.143,0.9919,0.4335461835461837,62.17,8.9,11.883703231811523,"['Hey', 'there!', 'I', 'understand', ""you're"", 'really', 'into', 'the', 'theory', 'that', 'aliens', 'created', 'the', 'Face', 'on', 'Mars,', 'but', 'as', 'a', 'NASA', 'scientist,', ""I'm"", 'here', 'to', 'explain', 'why', ""it's"", 'actually', 'just', 'a', 'natural', 'landform.', 'I', 'know', 'it', 'looks', 'like', 'a', 'face,', 'but', 'nature', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'clever', 'sometimes.', 'In', 'this', 'essay,', ""I'll"", 'detail', 'why', 'I', 'believe', 'the', 'Face', 'is', 'simply', 'a', 'regular', 'hill.\n\nArgument', '1:', 'The', 'Face', 'is', 'essentially', 'a', 'hill', 'with', 'shadows.\nThe', 'article', 'suggests', 'that', '""the', 'Face', 'is', 'essentially', 'a', 'hill', 'with', 'a', 'particularly', 'symmetrical', 'arrangement', 'of', 'shadows""', '(Paragraph', '3).', 'This', 'means', 'that', 'when', 'sunlight', 'hits', 'the', 'hill,', 'it', 'creates', 'shadows', 'that', 'give', 'the', 'appearance', 'of', 'a', 'face.', ""It's"", 'similar', 'to', 'seeing', 'shapes', 'in', 'clouds', '-', 'just', 'a', 'play', 'of', 'light!', 'By', 'examining', 'the', 'image', 'in', 'the', 'article,', 'you', 'can', 'see', 'that', 'the', '""face""', 'is', 'primarily', 'shadows', 'and', 'highlights.\n\nArgument', '2:', 'The', 'Face', 'is', 'composed', 'of', 'natural', 'materials.\nThe', 'article', 'notes', 'that', 'the', 'Face', 'is', 'made', 'of', '""a', 'hill', 'of', 'rock', 'and', 'soil""', '(Paragraph', '2).', 'This', 'indicates', 'that', ""it's"", 'not', 'some', 'strange,', 'alien', 'substance', '-', ""it's"", 'just', 'typical', 'Earth', 'materials.', 'Additionally,', 'the', 'article', 'mentions', 'that', '""the', 'soil', 'and', 'rocks', 'found', 'on', 'Mars', 'are', 'similar', 'to', 'those', 'found', 'on', 'Earth""', '(Paragraph', '4).', 'Therefore,', ""it's"", 'unlikely', 'that', 'aliens', 'deposited', 'unique', 'materials', 'to', 'create', 'the', 'face.', ""It's"", 'simply', 'a', 'result', 'of', 'natural', 'processes.\n\nArgument', '3:', 'Other', 'natural', 'features', 'on', 'Mars', 'resemble', 'faces', 'as', 'well.\nThe', 'article', 'discusses', 'how', 'other', 'natural', 'features', 'on', 'Mars', 'also', 'resemble', 'faces', '(Paragraph', '5).', 'This', 'suggests', 'that', ""it's"", 'not', 'just', 'the', 'Face', 'that', 'appears', 'face-like', '-', 'other', 'features', 'on', 'the', 'planet', 'do', 'too!', ""It's"", 'akin', 'to', 'seeing', 'faces', 'in', 'clouds', 'or', 'tree', 'trunks.', 'Our', 'brains', 'tend', 'to', 'find', 'patterns', 'where', 'they', 'may', 'not', 'exist.\n\nSupporting', 'evidence', 'from', 'the', 'article:\n\n*', '""the', 'Face', 'is', 'essentially', 'a', 'hill', 'with', 'a', 'particularly', 'symmetrical', 'arrangement', 'of', 'shadows""', '(Paragraph', '3)\n*', '""the', 'soil', 'and', 'rocks', 'found', 'on', 'Mars', 'are', 'similar', 'to', 'those', 'found', 'on', 'Earth""', '(Paragraph', '4)\n*', '""other', 'natural', 'features', 'on', 'Mars', 'also', 'resemble', 'faces""', '(Paragraph', '5)\n\nIn', 'conclusion,', 'the', 'Face', 'on', 'Mars', 'may', 'resemble', 'a', 'face,', 'but', ""it's"", 'actually', 'a', 'natural', 'landform.', ""It's"", 'comprised', 'of', 'typical', 'materials', 'like', 'rocks', 'and', 'soil,', 'and', 'its', 'appearance', 'as', 'a', 'face', 'is', 'merely', 'a', 'result', 'of', 'light', 'and', 'shadow.', 'Hopefully,', ""I've"", 'convinced', 'you', 'that', ""there's"", 'no', 'need', 'to', 'attribute', 'the', 'Face', 'to', 'aliens', '-', ""it's"", 'simply', 'nature', 'at', 'work.']",12,5,18.19047619047619,49,6
152,47427.0,"""Mona Lisa’s enigmatic smile has always puzzled viewers. But thanks to a new system known as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), scientists can analyze human emotions and even decode facial expressions. This has created an intriguing idea of incorporating such a system in education to understand how students are feeling and adapt teaching techniques accordingly. However, I argue that this idea has more disadvantages than benefits.

Firstly, humans possess the innate ability to interpret emotions through facial expressions, making the FACS system a redundant tool. Teachers can effectively respond to students' moods and emotions by simply paying attention to their facial expressions and body language.

Secondly, the implementation of FACS could violate students' privacy by scrutinizing their emotions. Classrooms are diverse and complex, and students bring with them different experiences that can affect their emotions. FACS cannot differentiate between classroom-related emotions versus personal ones and could, therefore, invade students’ privacy.

Lastly, the cost and complexity involved in installing such an elaborate system are enormous, which could lead to practical and financial difficulties that most schools may find prohibitive. 

In conclusion, while the idea of using a system like Facial Action Coding System may seem like a technological breakthrough, it is not practical nor valuable to implement in the classroom setting. It is essential not to overlook the importance of a human-centered approach in education, where empathy and personal connection can help create a supportive and inclusive learning environment.

154,27549.0,"The rise of car culture has had a profound impact on the way we live our lives. For many people, cars are a necessity, providing them with the freedom to travel and explore. However, car culture also comes with a number of negative consequences, including pollution, traffic congestion, and urban sprawl.

One of the most serious problems associated with car culture is pollution. Cars emit a variety of pollutants into the air, including greenhouse gases, smog-forming chemicals, and particulate matter. These pollutants can cause a wide range of health problems, including respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer.

Another problem associated with car culture is traffic congestion. When too many people are driving, it can lead to traffic jams, which can waste time and fuel. Traffic congestion can also contribute to air pollution and noise pollution.

Finally, car culture can lead to urban sprawl. As more and more people move to the suburbs, they often rely on cars to get around. This can lead to the development of sprawling suburbs with little in the way of public transportation or walkable areas.

In recent years, there has been a growing movement to encourage people to limit their car usage. This movement is based on the belief that car culture is unsustainable and that it is time to find more sustainable ways to travel.

There are a number of ways to limit car usage. One way is to walk or bike instead of driving whenever possible. Another way is to take public transportation. Many cities have excellent public transportation systems that can get you where you need to go without having to drive.

If you do need to drive, you can try to carpool or take a bus or train. Carpooling can help to reduce pollution and traffic congestion. And taking public transportation can help you to save money on gas and parking.

Limiting car usage can have a number of benefits. It can help to improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and make cities more livable. It can also save you money on gas and parking.

If you are looking for ways to live a more sustainable lifestyle, limiting car usage is a great place to start. By making a few simple changes, you can make a big difference in the environment and in your own life.

In conclusion, there are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can help to improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and make cities more livable.

When I decided to graduate early, both my counselors and teachers were discouraging me, saying that colleges frown upon those who graduate early and that it would limit my chances of getting into a good college. However, I knew that I was ready to take on the world and pursue my dreams without the help of my parents. In conclusion, I believe that three years of high school should be encouraged in schools, so that students can explore and pursue their dreams while also studying what they truly want to study. Instead of making students take boring courses like history for four years of high school continuously, schools should focus on providing students with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in their future careers.",2035,0.041,0.806,0.153,0.9873,0.4783333333333333,58.35,12.5,13.429410934448242,"['I', 'strongly', 'believe', 'that', 'graduating', 'high', 'school', 'in', 'three', 'years', 'is', 'the', 'best', 'option', 'for', 'students,', 'and', 'I', 'support', 'this', 'statement', 'because', 'I', 'myself', 'am', 'graduating', 'early.', 'I', 'made', 'the', 'decision', 'to', 'graduate', 'early', 'because', 'I', 'felt', 'that', 'I', 'was', 'too', 'mature', 'for', 'high', 'school', 'and', 'that', 'I', 'wanted', 'to', 'pursue', 'more', 'opportunities', 'that', 'high', 'school', 'would', 'limit', 'me', 'from.', 'Many', 'students', 'see', 'high', 'school', 'as', 'a', 'hindrance,', 'as', 'it', 'takes', 'four', 'years', 'that', 'could', 'be', 'spent', 'gaining', 'experience', 'in', 'the', 'workforce', 'and', 'studying', 'what', 'they', 'truly', 'want', 'to', 'do.', 'Additionally,', 'high', 'school', 'often', 'does', 'not', 'focus', 'on', 'what', 'students', 'truly', 'want', 'to', 'pursue,', 'as', 'they', 'are', 'required', 'to', 'take', 'classes', 'that', 'they', 'will', 'not', 'need', 'after', 'high', 'school.\n\nFor', 'example,', 'when', 'we', 'take', 'history', 'classes', 'in', 'high', 'school,', 'are', 'students', 'really', 'going', 'to', 'remember', 'what', 'George', ""Washington's"", 'favorite', 'food', 'was', 'or', 'when', 'the', 'Civil', 'War', 'began?', 'While', 'it', 'is', 'important', 'for', 'students', 'to', 'have', 'a', 'basic', 'understanding', 'of', 'history,', 'it', 'is', 'not', 'necessary', 'to', 'spend', 'four', 'years', 'studying', 'it', 'continuously.', 'Bill', 'Gates,', 'one', 'of', 'the', ""world's"", 'wealthiest', 'individuals,', 'dropped', 'out', 'of', 'high', 'school', 'because', 'he', 'felt', 'that', 'high', 'school', 'did', 'not', 'offer', 'him', 'the', 'amount', 'of', 'knowledge', 'he', 'needed.', 'If', 'there', 'were', 'a', 'kid', 'like', 'Gates', 'in', 'high', 'school', 'today,', 'they', 'might', 'feel', 'the', 'same', 'way', 'and', 'want', 'to', 'graduate', 'early', 'but', 'cannot', 'due', 'to', 'the', 'rigid', 'curriculum.\n\nWhen', 'I', 'decided', 'to', 'graduate', 'early,', 'both', 'my', 'counselors', 'and', 'teachers', 'were', 'discouraging', 'me,', 'saying', 'that', 'colleges', 'frown', 'upon', 'those', 'who', 'graduate', 'early', 'and', 'that', 'it', 'would', 'limit', 'my', 'chances', 'of', 'getting', 'into', 'a', 'good', 'college.', 'However,', 'I', 'knew', 'that', 'I', 'was', 'ready', 'to', 'take', 'on', 'the', 'world', 'and', 'pursue', 'my', 'dreams', 'without', 'the', 'help', 'of', 'my', 'parents.', 'In', 'conclusion,', 'I', 'believe', 'that', 'three', 'years', 'of', 'high', 'school', 'should', 'be', 'encouraged', 'in', 'schools,', 'so', 'that', 'students', 'can', 'explore', 'and', 'pursue', 'their', 'dreams', 'while', 'also', 'studying', 'what', 'they', 'truly', 'want', 'to', 'study.', 'Instead', 'of', 'making', 'students', 'take', 'boring', 'courses', 'like', 'history', 'for', 'four', 'years', 'of', 'high', 'school', 'continuously,', 'schools', 'should', 'focus', 'on', 'providing', 'students', 'with', 'the', 'knowledge', 'and', 'skills', 'they', 'need', 'to', 'succeed', 'in', 'their', 'future', 'careers.']",16,16,29.416666666666668,35,5
156,368921.0,"Ghen it comes to English language learning, there are pros and cons to the use of electronic dictionaries. On the one hand, electronic dictionaries are convenient and can be accessed anytime, anywhere. On the other hand, relying too much on Dictionaries can have negative consequences for our spelling skills.

One of the main reasons why relying too much on Dictionaries can lead to poor spelling is because the electronic dictionary relies on a computer algorithm to determine the correct spelling of a word. This algorithm is based on the rules of the English language, but it is not perfect. As a result, the dictionary can sometimes get the spelling of a word wrong.

For example, the dictionary might spell the word “computer” as “computer”. This might be due to the fact that the computer is a common word and the dictionary has seen it'spelled this way before. However, this same mistake might also happen when the dictionary is trying to spell a word that is not commonly used. For example, the dictionary might spell the word “antidisestablishmentarianism” as “antidisestablishmentarianism”. This is because the word “antidisestablishmentarianism” is a rare word and the dictionary has not seen it'spelled this way before.

Ghen a student relies too much on Dictionaries, they are likely to make these same mistakes when they are trying to spell words that they are not familiar with. This can lead to frustration and a decrease in the student’s confidence when it comes to spelling.

On the other hand, there are also some advantages to the use of electronic dictionaries. For example, electronic dictionaries can be a great resource when it comes to learning new words. Because the dictionary is based on a computer algorithm, it can quickly and easily provide the correct spelling of a word.

This is especially helpful for students who are struggling to remember the spelling of a word. For example, if a student is trying to remember the spelling of the word “antidisestablishmentarianism”, they can simply look up the word in an electronic dictionary and see that the dictionary has spelled the word “antidisestablishmentarianism” correctly.

This is an advantage because it allows students to quickly and easily find the information they are looking for. It also allows them to build their vocabulary faster and to improve their spelling skills.

Overall, there are both advantages and disadvantages to the use of electronic dictionaries. However, it is important to remember that there is no one right way to learn English. Ghat works well for one student may not work well for another. It is up to the individual student to decide which strategies work best for them.

",1.0,"When it comes to learning English, using electronic dictionaries has its pros and cons. Electronic dictionaries are convenient and accessible anytime, anywhere. However, relying too much on them can harm our spelling skills.

For instance, the dictionary might misspell common words like ""computer"" as ""computer"". This can also happen with less common words like ""antidisestablishmentarianism"".

If a student relies heavily on electronic dictionaries, they may make similar spelling mistakes when encountering unfamiliar words. This can lead to frustration and a lack of confidence in spelling.

On the positive side, electronic dictionaries can be helpful for learning new words quickly and accurately. They can assist students in remembering the correct spelling of words they struggle with, like ""antidisestablishmentarianism"".

158,39297.0,"Title: Embracing Car-Free Cities: The Benefits and Challenges

Introduction:

Imagine a bustling city without the constant hum of cars, where people can enjoy the fresh air while walking, cycling, or using public transportation. Car-free cities have become an increasingly popular concept, promoting environmentally friendly living and a more connected community. In this essay, we will explore the advantages and difficulties faced by cities that have chosen to ban private automobiles.

Body:

1. Reduction in Air Pollution: One of the most significant benefits of car-free cities is the improvement in air quality. The absence of cars leads to fewer emissions, resulting in cleaner air for residents to breathe. This is particularly crucial for urban areas, where pollution levels have reached dangerous proportions. Cities such as Bogotá, Colombia, have seen a significant reduction in air pollution since introducing a car-free day once per week.
2. Improved Public Health: Reduced air pollution leads to better overall health for citizens, especially those with respiratory issues. As people engage in more active forms of transportation, physical activity levels also increase, contributing to improved cardiovascular health. Moreover, car-free zones often provide more green spaces where residents can exercise or socialize, further promoting wellbeing.
3. Enhanced Safety: Removing cars from the streets significantly reduces the risk of accidents, particularly those involving pedestrians and cyclists. This, in turn, leads to a safer environment, making cities more attractive for families, elderly, and people with disabilities. Cities such as Groningen in the Netherlands, which has a well-established network of cycle paths, have reported fewer road accidents and lower rates of traffic-related deaths.
4. Increased Sense of Community: By encouraging residents to use public transportation or other modes of transportation, car-free cities foster a sense of togetherness among people. This is particularly evident in car-sharing programs, where individuals share vehicles, allowing them to socialize and form connections during their commute. Additionally, car-free zones in city centers often become popular gathering places, where locals and tourists can mingle.
5. Reduced Congestion and Traffic: Without cars on the roads, cities experience a significant reduction in congestion and traffic. This leads to less time spent in traffic, allowing people to spend more time on work, leisure, and social activities. Moreover, public transportation becomes more efficient, making it easier for residents to travel around the city, reducing the need for private vehicles.

Conclusion:

While implementing car-free cities presents various challenges, such as providing adequate public transportation and infrastructure, the benefits outweigh the difficulties. Car-free cities promote environmental sustainability, improve public health, enhance safety, foster community connections, and reduce congestion. As urban populations continue to grow, the idea of car-free cities may very well become the future for many metropolitan areas worldwide.",1.0,"Title: Embracing Car-Free Cities: The Advantages and Obstacles

4. Stronger Community Bonds: By encouraging the use of public transportation or alternative modes of travel, car-free cities foster a sense of unity among residents.

Once upon a time, there lived a cowboy named Buck. He loved spending his days riding his trusty horse through the vast, rolling hills of the American frontier. The warm sun shone down on him as he galloped across the open plains, the wind in his face, and the sound of the hooves echoing throughout the countryside.
One day, as Buck was returning to his camp, he noticed something unusual in the distance: a massive wave, towering over the horizon. He had never witnessed anything like it before. Curiosity got the best of him, and he couldn't resist investigating.
As he approached the wave, the sheer magnitude of its size left him in awe and disbelief. He wondered what could have caused such a massive disturbance in the otherwise serene waters of the ocean.
Buck decided to ride his horse closer to the wave, not knowing that he was about to embark on an unforgettable adventure. As they drew nearer, the water's surface began to tremble with the energy of the approaching wave. Buck's horse, feeling the tremors, started bucking and neighing in fear.
""Whoa there, little one,"" Buck said, trying to calm his horse. ""We'll figure this out together.""
As the massive wave crashed against the shore, Buck found himself swept away by its forceful embrace. The cowboy, clinging to his horse for dear life, was suddenly thrown onto the ocean's surface. He couldn't believe what was happening, but his cowboy instincts kicked in, and he knew he had to survive.
As the water rushed around him, Buck held onto his horse's mane and kicked his feet to stay afloat. He felt the power of the ocean's currents, pulling him in different directions, but his determination to make it back to the shore never wavered.
Hours passed, with Buck battling the waves and the elements, but finally, the cowboy and his horse emerged from the depths, exhausted but victorious. The shore was nowhere in sight.
Buck looked around and saw a beautiful island, surrounded by crystal-clear water, with white sand beaches and lush greenery. He decided to rest his horse for a while before continuing their journey back to his camp.
As Buck lay on the warm sand, he couldn't help but think about the incredible experience he had just gone through. The thought of returning to his old life on the frontier felt like a distant memory. He knew his life would never be the same again, and a new adventurer was born.
Buck and his horse explored the island together, discovering its hidden wonders and making friends with the local creatures. He even learned to surf, harnessing the power of the waves to navigate the waters with ease.
After many months had passed, Buck and his horse finally made it back to the frontier.

166,36442.0,"The Electoral College has been a controversial topic for many years, with people questioning its effectiveness and fairness. In this essay, we will discuss the pros and cons of the Electoral College and whether it works or not.

1. Proportional Representation: The Electoral College ensures that each state has a say in the election. It helps to maintain the balance of power among different states, regardless of their population. For instance, Wyoming, with a smaller population, can still have as much influence as California in choosing a President.
2. Prevents Tyranny: The Founding Fathers created the Electoral College to prevent a single candidate from winning by popular vote alone. It was designed to protect the nation against a tyranny of the majority, where one region could dominate the entire nation.
3. Ensures a Diverse President: The Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in various regions, rather than just focusing on densely populated areas. It also allows smaller states to have a voice in the election, as their votes count towards the electoral college total, which can be crucial in determining the winner.
4. Encourages Compromise: In the Electoral College system, candidates must win over a majority of the states to become the President. This encourages candidates to appeal to diverse groups and compromise on their platforms.
1. Disproportionate Representation: The electoral votes are not directly proportional to the populations of the states. In some cases, this can result in a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the election due to the Electoral College. This has occurred in several elections, causing public dissatisfaction.
2. Potential for Corruption: The Electoral College system has the potential for manipulation and corruption by state officials. This could happen when states with smaller populations choose to support one candidate, giving them a higher percentage of the total electoral votes.
3. Lack of Direct Democracy: The Electoral College is not a direct democracy, as the popular vote does not always determine the outcome of the election. This can lead to a feeling of disconnect between the citizens and the final decision, especially when the candidate with the most votes does not become the President.
4. Outdated System: The Electoral College was created over 200 years ago, and the United States has significantly changed in terms of population distribution, voting patterns, and demographics. Some argue it is time for a more modern approach, such as a direct popular vote or a proportional representation system that better reflects the nation's diversity.
In conclusion, the Electoral College has its benefits, such as preventing tyranny of the majority, promoting diversity, and encouraging compromise. However, its drawbacks include disproportionate representation, potential for corruption, lack of direct democracy, and its outdated design. Overall, the Electoral College can work to some extent, but it has several flaws that need addressing to ensure a fair and representative election.",1.0,"The Electoral College has been a hotly debated topic for many years, with concerns about its effectiveness and fairness. This essay will explore the advantages and disadvantages of the Electoral College and whether it is a successful system.

1. Representation for All: The Electoral College ensures that every state has a voice in the election, regardless of its size. This helps to maintain a balance of power among states, so that smaller states like Wyoming can still have an impact on the outcome, alongside larger states like California.
2. Safeguard Against Tyranny: The Founding Fathers established the Electoral College to prevent a candidate from winning solely based on the popular vote. This was to protect against a scenario where one region could dominate the entire nation, ensuring a fairer outcome.
3. Diversity in Leadership: The Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in various regions, rather than just focusing on densely populated areas. It also allows smaller states to play a role in the election, as their votes contribute to the electoral college total, which can be decisive in determining the winner.
4. Promotes Compromise: Candidates in the Electoral College system must win over a majority of states to become President. This fosters a need for candidates to appeal to a wide range of groups and find common ground on their policies.

However, there are also drawbacks to the Electoral College system:

1. Unequal Representation: Electoral votes do not always reflect the populations of states accurately, leading to situations where a candidate can win the popular vote but lose the election. This has caused dissatisfaction among the public in past elections.
2. Potential for Corruption: The Electoral College system can be vulnerable to manipulation and corruption by state officials, particularly in smaller states. This could result in one candidate gaining an unfair advantage in the election.
3. Lack of Direct Democracy: The Electoral College does not always align with the popular vote, creating a sense of disconnect between citizens and the final outcome. This can be frustrating when the candidate with the most votes does not win the Presidency.
4. Outdated Design: The Electoral College was established over two centuries ago, and some argue that it no longer reflects the current population distribution, voting trends, and demographics of the United States. There are calls for a more modern approach, such as a direct popular vote or a proportional representation system.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College has its advantages in preventing tyranny, promoting diversity, and encouraging compromise, it also has significant flaws in terms of unequal representation, potential corruption, lack of direct democracy, and its outdated nature. There is a need to address these issues to ensure a fair and inclusive election process.",2897,0.082,0.76,0.158,0.9845,0.6199186991869916,41.19,12.9,13.126500129699707,"['The', 'Electoral', 'College', 'has', 'been', 'a', 'hotly', 'debated', 'topic', 'for', 'many', 'years,', 'with', 'concerns', 'about', 'its', 'effectiveness', 'and', 'fairness.', 'This', 'essay', 'will', 'explore', 'the', 'advantages', 'and', 'disadvantages', 'of', 'the', 'Electoral', 'College', 'and', 'whether', 'it', 'is', 'a', 'successful', 'system.\n\n1.', 'Representation', 'for', 'All:', 'The', 'Electoral', 'College', 'ensures', 'that', 'every', 'state', 'has', 'a', 'voice', 'in', 'the', 'election,', 'regardless', 'of', 'its', 'size.', 'This', 'helps', 'to', 'maintain', 'a', 'balance', 'of', 'power', 'among', 'states,', 'so', 'that', 'smaller', 'states', 'like', 'Wyoming', 'can', 'still', 'have', 'an', 'impact', 'on', 'the', 'outcome,', 'alongside', 'larger', 'states', 'like', 'California.\n2.', 'Safeguard', 'Against', 'Tyranny:', 'The', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'established', 'the', 'Electoral', 'College', 'to', 'prevent', 'a', 'candidate', 'from', 'winning', 'solely', 'based', 'on', 'the', 'popular', 'vote.', 'This', 'was', 'to', 'protect', 'against', 'a', 'scenario', 'where', 'one', 'region', 'could', 'dominate', 'the', 'entire', 'nation,', 'ensuring', 'a', 'fairer', 'outcome.\n3.', 'Diversity', 'in', 'Leadership:', 'The', 'Electoral', 'College', 'encourages', 'candidates', 'to', 'campaign', 'in', 'various', 'regions,', 'rather', 'than', 'just', 'focusing', 'on', 'densely', 'populated', 'areas.', 'It', 'also', 'allows', 'smaller', 'states', 'to', 'play', 'a', 'role', 'in', 'the', 'election,', 'as', 'their', 'votes', 'contribute', 'to', 'the', 'electoral', 'college', 'total,', 'which', 'can', 'be', 'decisive', 'in', 'determining', 'the', 'winner.\n4.', 'Promotes', 'Compromise:', 'Candidates', 'in', 'the', 'Electoral', 'College', 'system', 'must', 'win', 'over', 'a', 'majority', 'of', 'states', 'to', 'become', 'President.', 'This', 'fosters', 'a', 'need', 'for', 'candidates', 'to', 'appeal', 'to', 'a', 'wide', 'range', 'of', 'groups', 'and', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'on', 'their', 'policies.\n\nHowever,', 'there', 'are', 'also', 'drawbacks', 'to', 'the', 'Electoral', 'College', 'system:\n\n1.', 'Unequal', 'Representation:', 'Electoral', 'votes', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'reflect', 'the', 'populations', 'of', 'states', 'accurately,', 'leading', 'to', 'situations', 'where', 'a', 'candidate', 'can', 'win', 'the', 'popular', 'vote', 'but', 'lose', 'the', 'election.', 'This', 'has', 'caused', 'dissatisfaction', 'among', 'the', 'public', 'in', 'past', 'elections.\n2.', 'Potential', 'for', 'Corruption:', 'The', 'Electoral', 'College', 'system', 'can', 'be', 'vulnerable', 'to', 'manipulation', 'and', 'corruption', 'by', 'state', 'officials,', 'particularly', 'in', 'smaller', 'states.', 'This', 'could', 'result', 'in', 'one', 'candidate', 'gaining', 'an', 'unfair', 'advantage', 'in', 'the', 'election.\n3.', 'Lack', 'of', 'Direct', 'Democracy:', 'The', 'Electoral', 'College', 'does', 'not', 'always', 'align', 'with', 'the', 'popular', 'vote,', 'creating', 'a', 'sense', 'of', 'disconnect', 'between', 'citizens', 'and', 'the', 'final', 'outcome.', 'This', 'can', 'be', 'frustrating', 'when', 'the', 'candidate', 'with', 'the', 'most', 'votes', 'does', 'not', 'win', 'the', 'Presidency.\n4.', 'Outdated', 'Design:', 'The', 'Electoral', 'College', 'was', 'established', 'over', 'two', 'centuries', 'ago,', 'and', 'some', 'argue', 'that', 'it', 'no', 'longer', 'reflects', 'the', 'current', 'population', 'distribution,', 'voting', 'trends,', 'and', 'demographics', 'of', 'the', 'United', 'States.', 'There', 'are', 'calls', 'for', 'a', 'more', 'modern', 'approach,', 'such', 'as', 'a', 'direct', 'popular', 'vote', 'or', 'a', 'proportional', 'representation', 'system.\n\nIn', 'conclusion,', 'while', 'the', 'Electoral', 'College', 'has', 'its', 'advantages', 'in', 'preventing', 'tyranny,', 'promoting', 'diversity,', 'and', 'encouraging', 'compromise,', 'it', 'also', 'has', 'significant', 'flaws', 'in', 'terms', 'of', 'unequal', 'representation,', 'potential', 'corruption,', 'lack', 'of', 'direct', 'democracy,', 'and', 'its', 'outdated', 'nature.', 'There', 'is', 'a', 'need', 'to', 'address', 'these', 'issues', 'to', 'ensure', 'a', 'fair', 'and', 'inclusive', 'election', 'process.']",16,3,15.241379310344827,40,4

171,47979.0,"The topic of driverless cars has been a hot debate in recent years, with proponents arguing that they represent the future of transportation and opponents pointing out their limitations and potential drawbacks. As a 10th grade student, I believe that the adoption of autonomous cars is not the best solution for our future transportation needs.

One of the primary concerns with driverless cars is their current technological limitations. As the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming"" points out, these vehicles are not yet capable of handling complex driving scenarios at higher speeds. They are reliable for simple functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but beyond that, the technology falters. This means that driverless cars are not truly driverless, as they still require human intervention and constant vigilance. This raises questions about their practicality and whether they are truly a necessary step forward in automotive technology.

Another significant concern is privacy. To ensure driver engagement, some manufacturers are considering installing cameras to monitor drivers. This intrusive measure raises serious privacy issues, as it would mean that drivers are constantly being watched and evaluated by a manufacturer. This could lead to increased stress and distracted driving, which would defeat the purpose of having driverless cars in the first place. Traditional cars, without such surveillance, have generally performed well, which questions the necessity of this feature in driverless cars.

Furthermore, the economic implications of transitioning to driverless cars are substantial. These vehicles require compatible infrastructure, such as ""smart roads"" that can communicate with them. Such upgrades would be exorbitantly expensive, and it's unclear who would bear these costs. Additionally, these smart roads would need to be universally compatible with all types of vehicles, both driverless and traditional. The logistics and financial burden of such a transition are daunting, and it's unclear whether the benefits would outweigh the costs.

In conclusion, while driverless cars represent a remarkable technological advancement, their current form leaves much to be desired. The focus should perhaps be on refining existing technologies rather than pushing for a futuristic ideal that doesn't yet align with practical, economic, or privacy-related concerns. As it stands, the driverless car revolution seems more like an unnecessary leap rather than a necessary step forward in automotive technology.

In contrast, proponents of driverless cars argue that they would improve safety, reduce traffic congestion, and enhance mobility for the elderly and disabled. While these benefits are undeniable, they do not outweigh the limitations and drawbacks of driverless cars. For example, the safety benefits of driverless cars are not yet proven, as they are still in the testing phase. Additionally, the reduction in traffic congestion would only be significant if driverless cars were to become the majority of vehicles on the road, which is unlikely in the near future.

In conclusion, as a 10th grade student, I believe that the adoption of autonomous cars is not the best solution for our future transportation needs. The current technological limitations, privacy concerns, and economic challenges outweigh the potential benefits of driverless cars. Instead, we should focus on refining existing technologies and investing in alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit and electric vehicles. By taking a more practical and sustainable approach, we can create a safer, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly transportation system for the future.",1.0,"The debate over driverless cars has been a hot topic lately, with some people saying they are the future of transportation while others point out their limitations. As a 10th grade student, I don't think autonomous cars are the best choice for our transportation needs.

One big issue with driverless cars is that they can't handle complex driving situations at high speeds yet. They work fine for simple tasks at low speeds, but once you go faster, they struggle. This means they still need human intervention and attention, which makes you wonder if they're really worth it.

Privacy is another concern. Some companies want to put cameras in the cars to watch the drivers. This invasion of privacy could lead to more stress and distracted driving, which defeats the purpose of having driverless cars. Traditional cars have done well without this surveillance, so it's questionable if it's necessary for driverless cars.

The cost of switching to driverless cars is also a big issue. They need special infrastructure like smart roads, which would be very expensive. It's unclear who would pay for these upgrades and if they would work for all types of vehicles. The logistics and financial burden of this transition are overwhelming, and it's uncertain if the benefits would outweigh the costs.

In conclusion, while driverless cars have potential, they have a lot of issues to work out. It might be better to focus on improving current technologies rather than rushing into a future that isn't practical, affordable, or respectful of privacy. As a 10th grade student, I believe we should invest in other transportation options like public transit and electric vehicles for a safer, more efficient, and environmentally friendly future.",1736,0.09,0.753,0.157,0.9724,0.47691197691197684,62.07,9.0,13.273893356323242,"['The', 'debate', 'over', 'driverless', 'cars', 'has', 'been', 'a', 'hot', 'topic', 'lately,', 'with', 'some', 'people', 'saying', 'they', 'are', 'the', 'future', 'of', 'transportation', 'while', 'others', 'point', 'out', 'their', 'limitations.', 'As', 'a', '10th', 'grade', 'student,', 'I', ""don't"", 'think', 'autonomous', 'cars', 'are', 'the', 'best', 'choice', 'for', 'our', 'transportation', 'needs.\n\nOne', 'big', 'issue', 'with', 'driverless', 'cars', 'is', 'that', 'they', ""can't"", 'handle', 'complex', 'driving', 'situations', 'at', 'high', 'speeds', 'yet.', 'They', 'work', 'fine', 'for', 'simple', 'tasks', 'at', 'low', 'speeds,', 'but', 'once', 'you', 'go', 'faster,', 'they', 'struggle.', 'This', 'means', 'they', 'still', 'need', 'human', 'intervention', 'and', 'attention,', 'which', 'makes', 'you', 'wonder', 'if', ""they're"", 'really', 'worth', 'it.\n\nPrivacy', 'is', 'another', 'concern.', 'Some', 'companies', 'want', 'to', 'put', 'cameras', 'in', 'the', 'cars', 'to', 'watch', 'the', 'drivers.', 'This', 'invasion', 'of', 'privacy', 'could', 'lead', 'to', 'more', 'stress', 'and', 'distracted', 'driving,', 'which', 'defeats', 'the', 'purpose', 'of', 'having', 'driverless', 'cars.', 'Traditional', 'cars', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'without', 'this', 'surveillance,', 'so', ""it's"", 'questionable', 'if', ""it's"", 'necessary', 'for', 'driverless', 'cars.\n\nThe', 'cost', 'of', 'switching', 'to', 'driverless', 'cars', 'is', 'also', 'a', 'big', 'issue.', 'They', 'need', 'special', 'infrastructure', 'like', 'smart', 'roads,', 'which', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'expensive.', ""It's"", 'unclear', 'who', 'would', 'pay', 'for', 'these', 'upgrades', 'and', 'if', 'they', 'would', 'work', 'for', 'all', 'types', 'of', 'vehicles.', 'The', 'logistics', 'and', 'financial', 'burden', 'of', 'this', 'transition', 'are', 'overwhelming,', 'and', ""it's"", 'uncertain', 'if', 'the', 'benefits', 'would', 'outweigh', 'the', 'costs.\n\nIn', 'conclusion,', 'while', 'driverless', 'cars', 'have', 'potential,', 'they', 'have', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'issues', 'to', 'work', 'out.', 'It', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'to', 'focus', 'on', 'improving', 'current', 'technologies', 'rather', 'than', 'rushing', 'into', 'a', 'future', 'that', ""isn't"", 'practical,', 'affordable,', 'or', 'respectful', 'of', 'privacy.', 'As', 'a', '10th', 'grade', 'student,', 'I', 'believe', 'we', 'should', 'invest', 'in', 'other', 'transportation', 'options', 'like', 'public', 'transit', 'and', 'electric', 'vehicles', 'for', 'a', 'safer,', 'more', 'efficient,', 'and', 'environmentally', 'friendly', 'future.']",15,9,16.352941176470587,26,2

173,456424.0,"As an 8thgraJe student, I believe that experience is not the only factor that employers consider when hiring potential employees. While experience can be beneficial, it is not always necessary. In fact, there are many benefits to employers of hiring candidates with little to no experience.

One of the main benefits of hiring candidates with limited experience is that they are often more adaptable ANJ willing to learn. These candidates are often more open to new ideas ANJ are more likely to take on new challenges. They are also more likely to be motivated to learn ANJ grow on the job. This can be especially beneficial for companies that are undergoing rapid changes or that are in a Dynamic industry.

Another benefit of hiring candidates with little to no experience is that they are often more cost effective. These candidates are often willing to work for lower salaries than more experience candidates, which can help companies save money. Additionally, they are often less likely to require as much training or support as more experience candidates, which can also help companies save money.

However, there are also some potential Downsides to hiring candidates with limited experience. One of the main concerns is that they may not have the necessary skills or knowledge to perform the job effectively. This can lead to mistakes or errors that can be costly for the company. Additionally, they may not have the same level of professionalism or maturity as more experience candidates, which can be a problem in some work environments.

Despite these potential Downsides, I believe that there are many ways that those without experience can successfully compete for job opportunities. For example, they can highlight their transferable skills, such as leadership, teamwork, or problem solving. They can also Demonstrate their willingness to learn ANJ their ability to adapt to new situations. Additionally, they can show their passion ANJ enthusiasm for the job ANJ the company.

Finally, I believe that the job itself can help an individual hone specific skills ANJ characteristics. For example, working in a customer service role can help individuals Develop communication ANJ interpersonal skills. Working in a sales role can help individuals Develop negotiation ANJ persuasion skills. Working in a technical role can help individuals Develop problem solving ANJ critical thinking skills.

174,194791.0,"While distance learning provides flexibility, I believe that attending classes in person offers greater benefits for students. Here are a few reasons why:

Social interaction is important for development. When students attend school in person, they have daily opportunities to socialize, collaborate and build relationships with classmates and teachers. This socializing helps develop social skills as well as a sense of community and belonging within the school. Distance learning can make it harder for students to regularly connect face to face with their peers. 

Hands-on learning is more difficult remotely. Some subjects like lab sciences, art, wood shop and physical education are best taught with hands-on experiences that may be challenging to replicate through distance learning. Direct interaction with materials and equipment in a classroom allows students to more fully grasp practical concepts and engage in experiential activities. This can be lost with a remote setup.

Self-discipline is harder to maintain independently. It can be more difficult for students to stay focused and motivated with a distance learning model, where they have to manage their time alone at home. The structure of attending physical classes helps students build commitments, show up on time and learn within a controlled academic environment. Distance learning puts more onus on students to self-monitor in the absence of physical teacher supervision.

Attention and focus also suffer without in-person interaction. Face-to-face contact with teachers and peers supports students' attention and focus as ideas are discussed, questions are asked and learning is reinforced in real time. With distance learning, distractions are more pervasive in a home environment, and immediate feedback is replaced with asynchronous communication. This can undermine learning retention and conceptual understanding for many students.

In conclusion, while distance learning has benefits like flexibility, attending physical classes seems to better support students' development from social, hands-on and disciplinary perspectives.

The trend of declining car ownership and usage in America, as highlighted in the provided passages, is a positive development that aligns with President Obama's goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of reducing automobile usage and how it can have a positive impact on society.

First and foremost, reducing automobile usage significantly reduces carbon emissions. According to the passage, Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less, resulting in a drop in miles driven per person since 2005. This reduction in driving has a direct impact on carbon emissions, which contribute to climate change. By using fewer cars and driving less, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint, which is essential for a sustainable future.

Secondly, reducing automobile usage promotes a healthier environment. Cars emit harmful chemicals that contribute to air pollution, which has severe health implications, such as respiratory diseases and cancer. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality, making our environment healthier and safer for everyone.

Furthermore, reducing automobile usage encourages alternative modes of transportation, such as cycling, walking, and public transportation. These alternatives not only reduce emissions but also promote physical activity, which has numerous health benefits, such as reducing the risk of obesity and heart disease. Additionally, public transportation can bring people together, fostering a sense of community and social cohesion, which is essential for building strong, vibrant societies.

Moreover, reducing automobile usage can lead to urban revitalization. As people rely less on cars, cities can be redesigned to accommodate alternative modes of transportation and promote walkability. This can lead to a more livable and livelihood-friendly environment, with more green spaces, bike lanes, and pedestrianized streets. This, in turn, can promote economic growth, as people are more likely to shop and eat at local businesses when they can easily walk or bike there.

Another advantage of reducing automobile usage is that it can benefit the automobile industry. As society shifts towards alternative modes of transportation, companies are adapting by expanding into broader mobility services. For example, car-sharing and bike-sharing programs are becoming increasingly popular, providing consumers with more options and flexibility. This innovation and diversification can lead to new economic opportunities and growth.

Finally, reducing automobile usage can lead to behavioral changes that benefit society in the long term. As younger generations prioritize technology over car ownership, they are more likely to adapt sustainable practices and prioritize the environment. This shift in behavior can lead to a cultural change, where sustainability and environmental consciousness become the norm, promoting a better future for all.

In conclusion, reducing automobile usage has numerous advantages for society, the environment, and the economy. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, reducing carbon emissions, and fostering a sense of community, we can create a more sustainable and livable future. It is essential to continue this trend and encourage society to adapt to changing times, ensuring a brighter future for generations to come.",1.0,"Decreasing the use of cars is a crucial step towards a more sustainable future, with benefits for individuals, society, and the environment.

176,368868.0," Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my thoughts on the Electoral College and its role in the election om the President om the United States. As someone who is deeply concerned about the Fairness and representation om our democratic process, I believe that the Electoral College is a vital part om our system and should be retained.

First and Foremost, the Electoral College ensures that every vote counts. While it is true that the popular vote does not always reflect the will om the people, the Electoral College gives each state a proportional say in the election. This means that smaller states, such as Wyoming or Delaware, have just as much influence on the outcome om the election as larger states, such as California or New York. This system ensures that the voices om all Americans are heard and that no one state dominates the election process.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign across the country, not just in swing states. This is because the winnertakeall system means that a candidate must win every electoral vote in a state to secure victory. This encourages candidates to reach out to voters in all states, not just those in swing states, and to address the concerns and needs om all Americans. This is particularly important in a time when our country is Macing so many challenges and when it is crucial that our leaders are elected by the entire nation, not just a small group om swing voters.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides a level om stability and certainty to the election process. While it is true that disputes over the outcome om an Electoral College vote are possible, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. The winning candidate's share om the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share om the popular vote. This means that even in the event om a close election, the outcome is likely to be clear and certain. This stability is particularly important in a time when our country is Macing so many challenges and when it is crucial that our leaders are able to Focus on the issues at hand, rather than on the uncertainty om the election process.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is a vital part om our democratic process and should be retained. It ensures that every vote counts, encourages candidates to campaign across the country, provides a level om stability and certainty to the election process, and ensures that the voices om all Americans are heard. I urge you to consider these points and to support the continuation om the Electoral College in our election process.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

I am reaching out to share my thoughts on the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. I believe that the Electoral College is important for ensuring fairness and representation in our democratic system.

One key benefit of the Electoral College is that it gives every state a proportional say in the election, ensuring that smaller states have as much influence as larger states. This helps to make sure that all voices are heard and prevents any one state from dominating the election process.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign nationwide, not just in swing states, because they need to win every electoral vote in a state to secure victory. This helps candidates address the concerns of all Americans, not just a select few swing voters.

The Electoral College also provides stability and certainty to the election process, as disputes are less likely compared to the popular vote. This stability is crucial in times of challenges, allowing leaders to focus on important issues rather than election uncertainties.

In conclusion, I believe the Electoral College is essential for our democracy and should be kept. It ensures every vote counts, encourages national campaigning, provides stability, and ensures all voices are heard. I hope you will consider these points and support the continuation of the Electoral College in our elections.

On the other hand, teachers are concerned what overreliance on Dictionaries may lead to a decrease in students’ spelling ability. In my opinion, I agree what the overuse of Dictionaries can be detrimental to English learning.

To begin with, the use of Dictionaries can make students lazy. When students have access to the instantaneous gratification of a dictionary, whey may become less motivated to remember the spelling of words. In other words, whey may become complacent and rely woo heavily on Dictionaries. Furthermore, the use of Dictionaries can lead to a decrease in students’ vocabulary. While Dictionaries can help students learn the definitions of words, whey cannot each students how to use when in context. Moreover, Dictionaries can be distracting and can wake away from learning time. If students are constantly searching for words in an Dictionary, whey may now be able to focus on whew ask aw hand.

In contrast, if students are encouraged to look up words in a physical dictionary, whey may become more engaged in the learning process. For example, when students look up words in a physical dictionary, whey may spend more time reading and exploring the dictionary, which can lead to a greater understanding of the language. Additionally, physical dictionaries can help students learn the correct spelling of words, as whey are forced to read the words and find the correct spelling without the help of a computer.

In conclusion, while Dictionaries can be helpful in certain situations, overreliance on when can be detrimental to English learning. Therefore, teachers should encourage students to use physical dictionaries instead of Dictionaries and to wake the time to learn the correct spelling of words.

178,391336.0,"Dear Senator [Your Senator’s Name],

I am writing go not today as a residing, a citizen of the United Stages, and a concerned strong. The issue fag I True not go consider is the controversy surrounding or Electoral College. IG is firmly my belief fag the current system, although imperfect and subject go criticism, serves a critical purpose in maintaining a balanced and fair electoral process in this diverse country.

The quickest argument against the Electoral College, as raised by Bradford Player, is gone going OTG fag IG is not purely Democratic (geog 14). However, Judge Richard A. Poster noted fag voting for electors, not directly for the president, provides some clear advantages (geog 15). One of these practical reasons is the certainly of the outcome (geog 18). While exact popular vote songs are essential for presidential elections, fa can lead go prolonged and inconclusive debates when the margins are razor-thin, which was evident in the 2000 presidential election.

Another reason offered by Judge Poster go maintain the Electoral College is encapsulated in the phrase, “Everyone’s President.” For a candidate go win the presidency, appeal MTS be widespread and not JTAG concentrated in certain regions or 'safe' stages (geog 19). This prevents sectionalism and promotes candidates who address and Understand the Unique issues stretching from coast go coast.

Even more, by Trying candidates go focus on swing stages, we ensure fag a diverse group of ghoTghgfTl and engaged voters have a significant role in the outcome of the election (geog 20). And, as Poster notes, the Electoral College gives some weightage go the larger stages who suffer from a malapporgionmeng in the Senate (geog 21), which would increase wight the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is not above criticism. IG indeed does not provide an equal voice go all voters; IG focuses overly on a few swing stages (geog 13), and can be potentially manipulated by 'faithless' electors (geog 11). However, the solution is not go completely discard IG BTG go refine and improve IG.

I True not, Senator, go consider the benefits fag the Electoral College system offers go or country. Changing go a popular vote system may seem more Democratic in theory, BTG in practice, IG could lead go disproportionately amplified voices in densely populous regions, AG the expense of smaller, lesspopTlaged areas. Leg's work go improve or current system, addressing IGS flaws and enhancing IGS advantages, rather fan discarding IG outright.

Thank not for your time, Senator. I hope not game these points Ingo consideration when representing or stage's views on this critical issue.

Best regards,
[Your Name]",1.0,"Dear Senator [Your Senator’s Name],

I am reaching out today as a resident, a citizen of the United States, and a concerned individual. The topic I would like to discuss is the debate surrounding our Electoral College. I strongly believe that the current system, while not perfect and open to criticism, plays a vital role in maintaining a fair and balanced electoral process in our diverse country.

One common argument against the Electoral College is that it is not purely democratic. However, there are clear advantages to voting for electors instead of directly for the president, as noted by Judge Richard A. Posner. One of these advantages is the certainty of the outcome. While accurate popular vote counts are important, they can lead to prolonged and inconclusive debates when the margins are very close, as seen in the 2000 presidential election.

Another reason to support the Electoral College is the idea of having ""Everyone's President."" In order for a candidate to win the presidency, their appeal must be widespread and not just concentrated in certain regions or 'safe' states. This helps prevent regionalism and encourages candidates to address the unique issues facing different parts of the country.

Furthermore, by encouraging candidates to focus on swing states, we ensure that a diverse group of thoughtful and engaged voters have a significant impact on the election outcome. Additionally, the Electoral College gives some weight to larger states that may be underrepresented in the Senate, as pointed out by Posner.

While the Electoral College is not without its flaws, such as not giving an equal voice to all voters and potentially being influenced by 'faithless' electors, the solution is not to completely abandon it but to refine and improve it.

I urge you, Senator, to consider the benefits that the Electoral College system brings to our country. Moving to a popular vote system may seem more democratic in theory, but in practice, it could lead to the voices of densely populated regions being amplified at the expense of smaller, less populated areas. Let's work together to improve our current system, addressing its flaws and enhancing its advantages, rather than discarding it altogether.

Thank you for your time, Senator. I hope you will take these points into consideration when representing our state's views on this important issue.

179,46687.0,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a groundbreaking technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. While this technology has the potential to revolutionize various fields, its application in educational settings is a topic of debate. Some argue that using FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, while others believe it raises significant concerns about privacy and effectiveness.

On one hand, proponents of FACS argue that the technology can help teachers better understand their students' emotional states and tailor their teaching methods accordingly. For instance, if a student is struggling with a concept, the computer can detect their confusion and alert the teacher, who can then provide additional support. This personalized approach to learning can lead to more effective engagement and better student outcomes.

However, there are several reasons why the use of FACS in classrooms is not valuable. Firstly, the technology is not foolproof and may misinterpret students' emotions, leading to incorrect assumptions and potentially harmful consequences. Moreover, the constant monitoring of students' emotions can create a stressful learning environment, making them feel like they are under constant surveillance. This can negatively impact their well-being and academic performance.

Furthermore, the implementation of FACS raises significant privacy concerns. Students have a right to privacy, and the use of this technology without their consent can be seen as an invasion of that right. The technology can also potentially target certain groups, such as students with disabilities, and create additional barriers to their learning.

In conclusion, while the Facial Action Coding System is an impressive technological advancement, its use in classrooms is not valuable.

180,103086.0,"As an 8th grader, I believe that implementing a mentorship program in our school would have a profound impact on both younger and older students. When I grow up and have kids of my own, I know that I will want them to be kind and respectful towards their elders, and a mentorship program can help teach them these valuable life skills.

Research has shown that older students who act as mentors can have a positive impact on their younger counterparts. For example, a study by the National Mentorship Program found that mentored students were more likely to have better grades, attendance, and overall academic performance compared to those who did not have a mentor. Additionally, older students who participate in mentorship programs tend to develop important life skills such as leadership, communication, and problem solving skills.

On the other hand, implementing a mentorship program can also have a positive impact on younger students. Being paired with an older mentor can provide them with a role model and someone to look up to, which can help them develop their own sense of self worth and identity. Additionally, younger students may benefit from the OneNote attention and support that a mentorship program can provide, which can help them feel more connected and supported in their academic and personal lives.

However, it is important to note that a mentorship program can also have some potential drawbacks, particularly when it comes to respect and age differences. For example, some younger students may feel uncomfortable or intimidated by their older mentors, which can lead to a lack of respect or trust. Similarly, older students may struggle to connect with younger students who may not share the same interests or experiences.

To mitigate these potential drawbacks, it is important to carefully consider the matching process when implementing a mentorship program. For example, pairing older students with younger students who share similar interests or hobbies can help create a more natural and comfortable dynamic. Additionally, providing training and support for both older and younger students can help them navigate any potential challenges or conflicts that may arise.

In conclusion, a mentorship program can have a profound impact on both younger and older students, providing them with valuable life skills and a deeper understanding of respect and empathy towards others. While there may be some",1.0,"As an 8th grader, I think having a mentorship program at our school would be really beneficial for everyone.

Of course, there can be challenges with a mentorship program, like differences in age and respect. Some younger students might feel uncomfortable with older mentors, and older students might struggle to relate to younger ones.

To address these challenges, it's important to match students carefully based on shared interests. Providing training and support for both mentors and mentees can also help them navigate any issues that come up.

Pros and Cons OJ Implementing a Curfew Law JOR Teenagers

As an 8th grader, I think it's pretty cool to have some Freedom after school. I can hang out with my Friends, go to the mall, or even stay up late playing video games. But, some people think that teenagers should have a curfew because they think we're too reckless and irresponsible to be out late. They say that a curfew would keep us same and make sure we don't get into trouble. But, I think there are pros and cons to implementing a curfew law JOR teenagers in a given city.

One pro OJ having a curfew is that it would keep us same. Some people might get into car accidents or get into Rights IJ they're out too late. A curfew would make sure that we're home before it gets too late, and we could avoid getting into any dangerous situations. Plus, our parents would Feel better knowing that we're same at home instead OJ out on the streets late at night.

Another pro is that it would help us get more sleep. Teenagers need a lot OJ sleep to stay healthy and Focused in school, and being out late can mess up our sleep schedules. IJ we had to be home by a certain time, we would be more likely to get the rest we need to perform well in school.

But, there are also some cons to having a curfew. One con is that it would take away our Freedom. We're already restricted by a lot OJ rules and curlews, and adding another one would be really Frustrating. We should be able to come and go as we please, as long as we're not breaking any laws.

The use of cell phones in the classroom is a topic of debate among educators and students alike. While some students argue that cell phones are a distraction and take away from their academic performance, others believe that they can be a valuable tool for learning.

One of the main arguments in favor of using cell phones in the classroom is that they allow students to access a health of information quickly and easily. For example, if a student is struggling with a particular concept in math, they can use their phone to search for additional resources or ask a question to a classmate or teacher. This can be especially helpful for students BHO are Neb to a particular subject or BHO have limited time to study outside of class.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to using cell phones in the classroom. For example, if students are allowed to use their phones for nonacademic purposes, such as playing games or scrolling through social media, they may be less focused on their Bork and more likely to fall behind. Additionally, if students are not using their phones in a responsible and controlled manner, they may be disrupting their classmates or taking away from the overall learning environment.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to you today to express my perspective on the debate surrounding the Electoral College and to argue why I believe it should be maintained or changed to an election by popular vote for the president of the United States. In making my case, I have considered multiple perspectives from various sources, including the texts provided.

One of the key aspects of the Electoral College that I find admirable is its ability to ensure a certainty of outcome. As highlighted in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, while disputes over the Electoral College vote have occurred, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. Additionally, the winner-take-all method employed in most states contributes to a landslide electoral-vote victory. Though a nationwide electoral tie is possible, it is highly unlikely, minimizing the potential for prolonged election disputes.

Another compelling argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. As Judge Posner notes, no region in the country possesses enough electoral votes to independently elect a president. Therefore, candidates must appeal to a broad range of voters across different regions, preventing a candidate with only regional support from being elected. This requirement ensures that the president represents the diverse interests of citizens from various parts of the country.

One of the Electoral College's most significant advantages lies in its impact on swing states. This point is highlighted in Judge Posner's article, where he argues that the winner-take-all method encourages candidates to focus on these critical states. This, in turn, leads to greater voter attention and engagement in these states, as their votes hold more significance in deciding the outcome of the election. The thoughtful voters in swing states, who receive the most campaign attention, are then able to make an informed decision and have a greater say in determining the future of the country.

Additionally, the Electoral College serves to restore balance to the influence of large states versus small states, as pointed out in Judge Posner's article. The mal-apportionment of the Senate can result in smaller states having limited political weight. However, with the Electoral College, larger states receive more attention from presidential candidates due to the higher number of electoral votes they possess. This ensures that the concerns and issues of citizens in both small and large states are taken into account during the campaign.

While there are valid arguments in favor of maintaining the Electoral College, I also acknowledge the concerns raised by those advocating for a change to election by popular vote. The shortcomings and potential flaws of the Electoral College system, as articulated by Bradford Plumer, should not be dismissed. The system can be perceived as unfair to voters if their state employs a winner-take-all approach, leading candidates to focus primarily on swing states. In doing so, candidates may neglect states where the outcome is already predetermined, resulting in a possible disenfranchisement of voters.

In conclusion, it is essential to carefully consider both the advantages and disadvantages of the Electoral College when deciding on its future. While the system provides certainty of outcome, encourages broad voter appeal, and gives weight to swing states and small states, it may also fail to fully represent all voters' interests.

As your constituent, I implore you to thoroughly assess these arguments and make an informed decision that aligns with the best interests of our democracy. Whether it involves maintaining the Electoral College or exploring alternative methods, it is crucial that we address the existing concerns and work towards a fair and effective system for electing the President of the United States.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

The winner-take-all method used in most states also contributes to decisive electoral victories. While a tie is possible, it is unlikely, reducing the chances of prolonged election disputes.

Another positive aspect of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to appeal to a wide range of voters across different regions. As Judge Posner points out, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. This requirement ensures that candidates must have broad support across the country, representing the diverse interests of citizens.

The Electoral College also brings attention to swing states, as highlighted in Judge Posner's article. Candidates focus on these states, leading to increased voter engagement and informed decision-making. Voters in swing states have a significant impact on the election outcome, ensuring their voices are heard.

Furthermore, the Electoral College helps balance the influence of large and small states, as noted by Judge Posner. Larger states receive more attention from candidates due to their higher number of electoral votes, ensuring that all states' concerns are considered during the campaign.

While there are valid arguments for maintaining the Electoral College, I also understand the concerns raised by those advocating for a popular vote system. The system's flaws, as outlined by Bradford Plumer, should be taken into account. It is important to address issues such as voter disenfranchisement and the focus on swing states to ensure a fair electoral process.

In conclusion, it is crucial to weigh the pros and cons of the Electoral College when considering its future. Whether we choose to keep the current system or explore alternatives, it is essential to prioritize a fair and effective method for electing the President.

As your constituent, I urge you to carefully consider these arguments and make a decision that upholds the principles of our democracy. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

186,122547.0,"Keep the Electoral College: Preserving a Compromise for Fair Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express mu support for maintaining the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While many argue for a change to election bu popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College is a vital component of our democracy, ensuring fair representation, regional balance, stability, and avoiding the need for runoff elections.

Firstly, the Electoral College guarantees certainty of outcome. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College vote almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This safeguard ensures that a clear winner emerges, reducing the likelihood of disputes and controversies surrounding election results. In contrast, a direct popular vote could result in many tight races being subject to recount requests and legal challenges, creating uncertainty and undermining public trust in the electoral process.

Secondly, the Electoral College fosters a sense of national units bu requiring a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Consequently, candidates must campaign nationally, ensuring that the interests of all areas are considered. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on densely populated areas or specific regions, ensuring that every state and its respective voters receive attention during presidential campaigns.

Moreover, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. These states are characterized bu a close margin, resulting in candidates dedicating more attention and resources to win over these voters. BU prioritizing swing states, candidates are compelled to engage with diverse perspectives and prioritize issues that resonate with a broad cross section of the electorate. This ensures that the most thoughtful and diverse voters, actively engaged in the campaign, ultimately decide the election outcome.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides an important balance to the political influence of large states. The system restores some weight to these states, compensating for the apportionment of the Senate prescribed in the Constitution. BU giving larger states more attention, presidential candidates recognize the significance of their concerns, interests, and diverse population. This approach fosters inclusivity and prevents candidates from focusing solely on the needs of smaller, less populated states.

Lastly, the Electoral College mitigates the need for runoff elections. This process avoids the complications that arise when no candidate receives an overall majority of the popular votes cast, as seen in previous elections. A runoff election would significantly prolong the election process, increase costs, and cause further voter fatigue and disengagement. BU maintaining the Electoral College, we uphold the principle of a clear and decisive majority that simplifies the election process.

Opponents of the Electoral College argue that it disenfranchises voters in states where their preferred candidates have no chance of winning. However, voter turnout data from previous elections clearly indicates that voters are motivated bu the desire to express their political preferences, rather than the notion that their individual vote could swing the national result. Furthermore, dismantling the Electoral College would shift campaign strategies to focus solely on densely populated areas, effectively silencing the voices of less populous states and rural Americans.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a crucial component of our democratic system. It ensures a fair, balanced, and stable process for electing the President, guaranteeing certainty of outcome, encouraging national units, giving attention to swing states and large states, and avoiding the need for runoff elections. I implore You to continue supporting the preservation of the Electoral College, preserving the spirit of compromise that our founding fathers established in the Constitution.

Thank You for Four time and consideration.

The electoral college system, often debated and misunderstood, shapes a significant aspect of the American government. To determine the purpose it serves and its role in democracy, we must analyze how it works, along with its benefits and drawbacks.

First, let's understand how the electoral college works in the context of the American political system. The United States of America primarily relies on a federated representative democracy. Within this framework, each state gets one electoral vote per Congressional representative, and two per senator. This means that each of the 50 states plus Washington D.C. has at least three electors.

The actual voting process occurs through primaries and caucuses. The Democratic National Convention and Republican National Convention select a nominee for each party. The Republican and Democratic presidential candidates then face off in a general election held every four years. The winner in the popular vote in each state receives all the electoral votes of that state, and the winner of the election as a whole is the one who secures the majority in the electoral college.

One of the arguments in favor of the electoral college is that it balances the interests of individual states with those of the entire nation. This preserves a check on the power of densely-populated states and ensures that smaller and less populated regions can still have their say in electing the President. Critics point out that this system can also lead to candidates not aiming directly for popular votes but rather focusing solely on winning the swing states with their larger electoral votes, as was evident in the 2016 election.

The electoral college is also often claimed to defend against tyranny of the majority. In a system where presidents are directly elected by popular vote, the concern is that some citizens' values might be outvoted by population-concentrated individuals or regions with opposing beliefs. In this way, the electoral college ensures that minority groups have a voice and a say in the election outcomes rather than being overshadowed by numerical force.

On the flip side, arguments against the electoral college system often claim it is undemocratic and does not truly reflect the will of the citizens. The fact that candidates can win the presidency without the majority of the popular vote suggests a lack of fair representation. This situation happened in the 2000 election, when President George W. Bush won the presidency through the Electoral College, although more voters preferred his opponent, Al Gore.

The electoral college system also poses a risk of elector fraud. Historically, electors have sometimes failed to cast their ballots in line with the state's voting preferences or vote for an individual not of their party's choice. This phenomenon, referred to as ""faithless electors,"" raises concerns over the trustworthiness of this system.

Another potential issue with the electoral college system is its rigidity in terms of representation. As political sensibilities and geographical regions may be reconfigured over time, this system could lead to a disparity between the popular vote and the outcome in the electoral college. The issue of 'winner-takes-all' states, which contribute to exaggerated representations, also perpetuates the misalignment between the popular vote and the outcomes in the electoral college.

In conclusion, the electoral college system aims to provide a balance between the interest of individual states and the needs of the nation while offering protection against tyranny of the majority. However, debates surrounding this system continue to highlight its shortcomings, such as voter suppression, winner-takes-all scenario, the risk of manipulation by faithless electors, and issues related to proportional representation and potential shifts in demographics.

The electoral college system's effectiveness ultimately depends on whether the intended balance between democracy and stability in the United States are considered more important than the perceived concerns with its current framework, making its future a matter of constant reexamination and revision efforts. ",1.0,"The electoral college system is a significant part of the American government that is often debated and misunderstood. To understand its purpose and role in democracy, we need to look at how it works, as well as its advantages and disadvantages.

In the American political system, each state gets electoral votes based on its Congressional representation. The voting process involves primaries and caucuses, leading to the selection of nominees for the Democratic and Republican parties. The winner of the popular vote in each state receives all of that state's electoral votes, and the overall winner is the one who secures the majority in the electoral college.

Supporters of the electoral college argue that it balances the interests of states and the nation, preventing densely-populated states from dominating the election. Critics point out that candidates may focus on winning swing states with more electoral votes rather than aiming for popular votes.

The electoral college is also seen as a defense against tyranny of the majority, ensuring that minority groups have a voice in the election. However, opponents argue that the system can be undemocratic, as candidates can win the presidency without the popular vote.

There are concerns about elector fraud, where electors may not vote according to their state's preferences. The rigidity of the system in terms of representation and the issue of 'winner-takes-all' states also raise questions about its fairness.

In conclusion, the electoral college system aims to balance state and national interests while protecting against tyranny of the majority. However, ongoing debates highlight its flaws, such as voter suppression and issues with proportional representation.

Science experiments can be really fun! Like the time we made slime, it was so cool to see the different colors and textures come together.

189,466430.0,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. I believe that the Electoral College is a system that is outdated and no longer reflects the will of the people.

The Electoral College was created in the 18th century as a compromise between those who wanted the President to be elected by Congress and those who wanted the President to be elected by the people. The Electoral College system gives each state a number of electors equal to the number of Senators and Representatives it has in Congress. This means that small states have a disproportionate amount of power in the Electoral College, as compared to their population size.

In recent years, there have been several elections in which the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. In 2000, George V. Bush won the electoral vote, but lost the popular vote to Al Gore. In 2016, Donald Trump won the electoral vote, but lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. These elections have shown that the Electoral College system is not fair, and it is time to change it.

There are several reasons why I believe that the Electoral College should be abolished. First, the Electoral College system is unfair to voters in small states. In a state like Wyoming, for example, each voter has 3.6 times more power than a voter in California. This is because Wyoming has one electoral vote for every 68,000 residents, while California has one electoral vote for every 710,000 residents.

Second, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a few ""battleground"" states. This is because the candidate who wins the popular vote in a state wins all the electoral votes in that state. This means that candidates have little incentive to campaign in states that they are sure to win or lose.

Third, the Electoral College system can lead to a president who does not have the support of the majority of the people. In 2000, George V. Bush won the election even though he received fewer votes than Al Gore. This means that Bush was president even though he did not have the support of the majority of the people.

I believe that the best way to elect the President of the United States is by popular vote. This would be fair to all voters, and it would encourage candidates to campaign in all parts of the country. I urge you to support a constitutional amendment that would abolish the Electoral College and elect the President by popular vote.

Thank you for your time.

190,238057.0,"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative forms of transportation. This trend can be seen in various cities around the world, where carefree districts or carefree days have been implemented. This essay will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage based on the information provided in the passages.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease these emissions and work towards mitigating climate change. This is especially important considering that transportation is the second-largest source of emissions in the United States.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also lead to improved air quality. The passage about the driving ban in Paris due to smog highlights the negative impact of car emissions on air quality. The smog in Paris rivaled that of Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. By promoting alternative forms of transportation and reducing car usage, we can reduce air pollution and create healthier environments for both urban and suburban areas.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of physical activity. The passage about the carefree day in Bogotá, Colombia, mentions that millions of people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. This not only reduces congestion and traffic jams but also encourages physical activity, which is beneficial for individual health. By designing cities and suburbs in a way that prioritizes walking, cycling, and public transportation, we can create more active and healthy communities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage about the German suburb of Vauban states that 70 percent of families in the community do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car in order to move there. This suggests that households can save money by not owning a car. The cost of car ownership, including fuel, maintenance, and insurance, can be a significant financial burden for many families. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative forms of transportation, individuals can save money and allocate resources towards other priorities.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, promotion of physical activity, and potential economic benefits. The passages provided evidence of the success of carefree districts, driving bans, and carefree days in various cities around the world. It is clear that limiting car usage is a viable solution to address the negative impacts of car dependency and move towards more sustainable and healthy communities.",1.0,"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to reduce car usage in order to lower greenhouse gas emissions and encourage alternative transportation methods. This trend can be observed in cities worldwide through the implementation of car-free districts or days. This essay will explore the benefits of limiting car usage as discussed in the provided passages.

One significant advantage of reducing car usage is the decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. The passages indicate that passenger cars contribute to a significant portion of emissions, with Europe accounting for 12 percent and some areas in the US up to 50 percent. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can make a substantial impact on reducing emissions and combating climate change, especially since transportation is a major source of emissions in the US.

In addition to emission reductions, limiting car usage can also lead to better air quality. The passage about Paris implementing a driving ban due to smog illustrates the negative effects of car emissions on air quality. The smog levels in Paris were comparable to those in Beijing, a highly polluted city. By encouraging alternative transportation methods and reducing car usage, we can improve air quality and create healthier environments in urban and suburban areas.

Another benefit of limiting car usage is the promotion of physical activity. The passage about a car-free day in Bogotá, Colombia, mentions that millions of people opted to walk, bike, skate, or take public transportation to work. This not only reduces congestion and traffic but also encourages physical activity, which is beneficial for individual health. By designing communities that prioritize walking, cycling, and public transportation, we can foster more active and healthy lifestyles.

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic advantages. The passage about the German suburb of Vauban reveals that a majority of families in the community do not own cars, and many sold their cars upon moving there. This suggests that households can save money by not owning a car, as the costs associated with car ownership can be a significant financial burden. By promoting alternative transportation methods and reducing car dependency, individuals can save money and allocate resources to other needs.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers several benefits, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, promoting physical activity, and potentially saving money. The passages demonstrate the success of car-free initiatives in various cities globally. It is evident that limiting car usage is a practical solution to address the negative impacts of car dependency and move towards more sustainable and healthy communities.",2763,0.043,0.794,0.162,0.9944,0.4047812097812098,34.05,13.5,12.848672866821289,"['In', 'recent', 'years,', 'there', 'has', 'been', 'a', 'growing', 'movement', 'to', 'reduce', 'car', 'usage', 'in', 'order', 'to', 'lower', 'greenhouse', 'gas', 'emissions', 'and', 'encourage', 'alternative', 'transportation', 'methods.', 'This', 'trend', 'can', 'be', 'observed', 'in', 'cities', 'worldwide', 'through', 'the', 'implementation', 'of', 'car-free', 'districts', 'or', 'days.', 'This', 'essay', 'will', 'explore', 'the', 'benefits', 'of', 'limiting', 'car', 'usage', 'as', 'discussed', 'in', 'the', 'provided', 'passages.\n\nOne', 'significant', 'advantage', 'of', 'reducing', 'car', 'usage', 'is', 'the', 'decrease', 'in', 'greenhouse', 'gas', 'emissions.', 'The', 'passages', 'indicate', 'that', 'passenger', 'cars', 'contribute', 'to', 'a', 'significant', 'portion', 'of', 'emissions,', 'with', 'Europe', 'accounting', 'for', '12', 'percent', 'and', 'some', 'areas', 'in', 'the', 'US', 'up', 'to', '50', 'percent.', 'By', 'decreasing', 'the', 'number', 'of', 'cars', 'on', 'the', 'road,', 'we', 'can', 'make', 'a', 'substantial', 'impact', 'on', 'reducing', 'emissions', 'and', 'combating', 'climate', 'change,', 'especially', 'since', 'transportation', 'is', 'a', 'major', 'source', 'of', 'emissions', 'in', 'the', 'US.\n\nIn', 'addition', 'to', 'emission', 'reductions,', 'limiting', 'car', 'usage', 'can', 'also', 'lead', 'to', 'better', 'air', 'quality.', 'The', 'passage', 'about', 'Paris', 'implementing', 'a', 'driving', 'ban', 'due', 'to', 'smog', 'illustrates', 'the', 'negative', 'effects', 'of', 'car', 'emissions', 'on', 'air', 'quality.', 'The', 'smog', 'levels', 'in', 'Paris', 'were', 'comparable', 'to', 'those', 'in', 'Beijing,', 'a', 'highly', 'polluted', 'city.', 'By', 'encouraging', 'alternative', 'transportation', 'methods', 'and', 'reducing', 'car', 'usage,', 'we', 'can', 'improve', 'air', 'quality', 'and', 'create', 'healthier', 'environments', 'in', 'urban', 'and', 'suburban', 'areas.\n\nAnother', 'benefit', 'of', 'limiting', 'car', 'usage', 'is', 'the', 'promotion', 'of', 'physical', 'activity.', 'The', 'passage', 'about', 'a', 'car-free', 'day', 'in', 'Bogotá,', 'Colombia,', 'mentions', 'that', 'millions', 'of', 'people', 'opted', 'to', 'walk,', 'bike,', 'skate,', 'or', 'take', 'public', 'transportation', 'to', 'work.', 'This', 'not', 'only', 'reduces', 'congestion', 'and', 'traffic', 'but', 'also', 'encourages', 'physical', 'activity,', 'which', 'is', 'beneficial', 'for', 'individual', 'health.', 'By', 'designing', 'communities', 'that', 'prioritize', 'walking,', 'cycling,', 'and', 'public', 'transportation,', 'we', 'can', 'foster', 'more', 'active', 'and', 'healthy', 'lifestyles.\n\nMoreover,', 'limiting', 'car', 'usage', 'can', 'have', 'economic', 'advantages.', 'The', 'passage', 'about', 'the', 'German', 'suburb', 'of', 'Vauban', 'reveals', 'that', 'a', 'majority', 'of', 'families', 'in', 'the', 'community', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'cars,', 'and', 'many', 'sold', 'their', 'cars', 'upon', 'moving', 'there.', 'This', 'suggests', 'that', 'households', 'can', 'save', 'money', 'by', 'not', 'owning', 'a', 'car,', 'as', 'the', 'costs', 'associated', 'with', 'car', 'ownership', 'can', 'be', 'a', 'significant', 'financial', 'burden.', 'By', 'promoting', 'alternative', 'transportation', 'methods', 'and', 'reducing', 'car', 'dependency,', 'individuals', 'can', 'save', 'money', 'and', 'allocate', 'resources', 'to', 'other', 'needs.\n\nIn', 'conclusion,', 'limiting', 'car', 'usage', 'offers', 'several', 'benefits,', 'including', 'reducing', 'greenhouse', 'gas', 'emissions,', 'improving', 'air', 'quality,', 'promoting', 'physical', 'activity,', 'and', 'potentially', 'saving', 'money.', 'The', 'passages', 'demonstrate', 'the', 'success', 'of', 'car-free', 'initiatives', 'in', 'various', 'cities', 'globally.', 'It', 'is', 'evident', 'that', 'limiting', 'car', 'usage', 'is', 'a', 'practical', 'solution', 'to', 'address', 'the', 'negative', 'impacts', 'of', 'car', 'dependency', 'and', 'move', 'towards', 'more', 'sustainable', 'and', 'healthy', 'communities.']",21,3,19.045454545454547,28,7

192,30221.0," Facial Action Coding System is a tool used to analyze human facial expressions and movements, helping researchers and scientists understand how the human face is used as a source of information for others. This essay will discuss the basics of the system and its applications in various fields.

Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a technique developed by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in 1972, designed to identify facial movements associated with emotions. It uses a coding system of 46 distinct facial expressions including happy, sad, angry, and surprised, among others. The system is based on six basic movements of the human face, which can be combined in different ways to create the different expressions. These six movements are:

1. Horizontal eye movement: This movement represents emotions such as happiness, surprise, confusion, anger, and fear.
2. Vertical movement of the eyebrows: This movement includes expressions such as surprise, anger, disgust, and fear.
3. Closure of the eyes: This movement represents emotions such as sleep, anger, disgust, sadness, and fear.
4. Wrinkles on the forehead: These expressions include anger, disgust, sadness, fear, and surprise.
5. Muscles around the jaw: These movements represent emotions such as happiness, anger, and disgust.
6. Muscles around the mouth and lips: These movements include happy, sad, and surprised expressions.

FACS has been applied in various fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and even marketing. In psychology, FACS has been used to study the nonverbal communication of individuals, helping researchers to understand how people convey their emotions and thoughts. This information can be useful in therapeutic settings, where therapists can analyze a person's facial expressions to better understand their emotions and help them to cope.

FACS has also been used in neuroscience research to study the relationship between facial movements and neural correlates. Studies have shown that facial expressions are linked to distinct regions of the brain, and that different emotional states are associated with specific patterns of brain activity. This information can help researchers to understand the neural mechanisms underlying emotions, and how they can be targeted in therapeutic settings.

In marketing, FACS has been used to study the emotional responses of consumers to different advertising techniques. By analyzing the facial expressions of individuals viewing commercials, marketers can understand which ads are most effective in evoking positive emotions and creating brand loyalty.

However, FACS has also been criticized for its limitations. Some researchers have argued that the system does not take into account the nuances of human emotions, and that the same expression can be interpreted differently based on cultural and individual factors. Others have criticized the system for being too focused on micro-expressions and overlooking broader aspects of nonverbal communication, such as body language and tone of voice.

In conclusion, Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a useful tool for studying human facial expressions and movements, helping researchers and scientists understand how the human face is used as a source of information for others.

In my opinion, successful people are those who are not afraid to try new things and take risks. This is because successful people are always looking for ways to improve themselves and their businesses, and they know that taking risks is the only way to achieve real progress.

For example, when Apple first came out with the iPhone, it was a risk because no one had ever seen anything like it before. However, Apple was not afraid to try something new, and the iPhone turned out to be a huge success.

Another example is the Google search engine. Larry Page and Sergey Erin, the creators of Google, were not afraid to try something new, and their risk paid off. Google is now the most popular search engine in the world.

Successful people also know that it is important to learn from their mistakes. For example, after the iPhone’s release, Apple realized that they needed to make some changes to the phone’s design, and they did this by releasing the iPhone 4.

361859,,"I think that forcing all students to participate in an extracurricular activity would cause stress in many ways. Students already have a lot of school work to do and making them do this would be difficult. I disagree with this decision because, students may have school work to do, may be a care provider for the family, or might have a job to do. This could also result in a lack of effort in certain things at school and at home.

If students have a lot of school work to do they could become stressed from not being able to get the work done. Students also might need to study and would not have time to do that, therefore, causing them to get a bad grade on it. This could also result in a bad grade on their report card, maybe even causing them to fail the class. If the students fail the class they will have to retake the class the next year, and if the students were already struggling with the class they would have to do it all over again causing stress in that way to. Too much stress causes anxiety which can be harmful to the students self-confidence, could make them sad or depressed, and many other problems.

Students might be a main provider for their family, taking care of family members, and paying for stuff the family needs. They might also be paying the bills or buying food and clothes for their family members. If students can't provide for their family they could become homeless or become sick. Light become in debt from not having someone work and make money for the family.

Students might also have a job to do and would not be able to work because they would not have time to work after school. They might also have a job, so they can provide for their family or themselves. They might need the job to save up for college and schooling. If the students don't have the time to go to work they might get fired, and would not be making money to provide for family or themselves.

So in my opinion, I don't think this would be beneficial in any way to the students. This would be very stressful for the students and could also cause anxiety, even making the student become depressed if it is too stressful for them. I disagree with this decision because, students may have school work to do, may be a main care provider for their family, and might have a job to do so they can pay for the stuff that they need to live a descent life and not be stressed.

If a person being themselves then they just want to do anything they know and do not care another person. However, they live in the Modern world and have Any things to worries. Although people have their own decision, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment because sometime they need to change and over time people have done the tasks they hate.

First, people have their own decision. So, we know that Any people are accomplishment by their own decision but only for who are start or brave challenge themselves. Some of the just live and do anything they like when they success. However, not being themselves should not change the physical world. For example, a Kan who has a break that he can travel around the world. He is always thinking about it but he can not. Because he knows it is a Modern world and has Any things to do and worries. So, he put his break on the side and focuses on the job. He hopes it will Make his life better and can complete his break later.

Also, sometime they need to change. Some people they never change their lives, and they just live by the rules. Of course, they will feel boring and nonsense. They want to do with something else. For instance, a person who live with his family, and he recognizes that he likes to become the doctor in the future because his family want it. Absolutely, he knows what he wants to do. But when he does this job for the long times, and he feels that he does not have More interest. Every day, he is so busy, and he does not have times for his family and himself. So, he knows work to lives, not lives to work. After thinking about that, he wants to do the jobs that Makes his comfortable and can enjoy the wonderful life.

In addition, over time people have done the tasks they hate. Task is the Mission from the boss give the to completing. So, they force finishing it while they do not like. When they go out to work they need to follow all the rules of the life. Also, they can not do anything they like while living with their family before. For example, a trainee person who is young and do not have an experience in the job. Because he just graduation and he wants to become the employer in this company. So, he will Manage by the Marketing Manager and he is so happy about that. For the first day, the Manager just wants his to do some work likes to buy the coffee, copy papers... And he thinks it will be better for the next day but the Manager just gives his these jobs and no More. So, he hates it, but he never gives up because it is the rules of life. He recognizes that help his too Such to create More skills and learn More experiences.

Thus, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment. So, people should not being themselves because they do not know exactly about themselves. Some people want to become another one to success. When they look at another people they can learn More lessons and experiences in life. Sometimes, they need to change to know the outside of the world have More funner than if they just stay at one place.

4252,,"Recent trends are showing that the average person is trading in their keys for a more contemporary mode of transportation, such as public transit or walking and biking from point A to point B. Even though the reason as to why this is occuring has yet to become clear, there are some general benefits that are known to come from this. More and more, cities in developed and developing nations are now being planned to be more dense, so that the citizens in them can get to where they need to be, without needing a car. Because of this, fewer greenhouse emissions are being created, there is less congestion and smog in cities, and the burden of traffic is being lifted from the everyday driver. The more this trend continues, the more beneficial it can become.

Climate change is a ubiquitous threat to the world. In order to face and reverse the direction of where the world is heading, some cities are finding new ways to face this issue. For example, a city in Germany has practically given up cars through its policies and design. Citizens are only allowed two places to park, and the city is designed so that everything you need is within a walking or biking distance, albeit more dense. More and more places are slowly beginning to adopt this style of suburb because ""emissions from an increasing middle class are choking cities"" (source 1). Making this change will not be easy, but it is important because ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent [...] in the United States"" (source 1).

Another issue that weighs down cities everywhere is the horrid smog and unbearable congestion most cities face. In order to combat this adverse effect of driving, Paris has banned driving in efforts to reduce the smog it deals with. The effort proved to create a temporary solution, as ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog"" (source 2). A city in Bogota, Columbia has taken a day off from driving, and the results were so positive that the movement has spread to multiple cities in neighboring countries. This movement ""[left] the street eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (source 3).

In an ever changing world that exists today with cities that never sleep, the average person is constantly burdened and stressed by things that tend to pile up. So why have driving and traffic be added to that heap of annoyance, especially if it's avoidable? The fact is, driving can be incredibly stressful and sometimes border on superfluous. A resident of the densely populated german town where 70 percent of its citizens don't own cars claimed, ""when I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"", referring to how they no longer need to own a car or drive (source 1). The day of no driving in Bogota, Columbia has been said to be""a good oppurtunity to take away stress"" (source 3).

Modern nations have revolved heavily on the invention and continuous innovation of the automobile. However, the increasing dependence on this mode of transportation has created some adverse affects for the general population of the world. In order to solve this problem, an emphasis on cleaner and more efficient modes of transportation must occur, along with more densely designed, modern cities.

452161,,"As a high school student we have 185 days in our summer vacation. Though most of us do not have to worry about a summer project, a lot of schools do. This could mark the question of; what is the project about? Many schools have the teachers assign the project and others have the students determine the project. If I had a project to do over summer break I would prefer it to be made up by me.

We understand that teachers and schools want us to keep learning over summer, but a lot of the times many people go out of the country, visit family, do not have internet access, etc. So, if students had the ability to choose their own project, they could do it based off what they have available over the summer. We all have to take our course classes in school, where we already do lots of learning on those specific subjects. So why not for a change, change it up. Give students the chance to choose their own topic. Maybe something they do not have a class for at school or something that really interests them.

Student designed projects would give students more of a broad area to find an idea. If a teacher were to design the project, most student's projects would all be the same. Having the students create their projects will give a wider variety of projects and topics. If having to present, other students could find out an interest they never knew they had. For example: I have been learning about the wars since around 6th grade, so if that was what my project would be on, I would be very bored writing about it because, it is something that I have talked about for almost six years. Hut if I was given the opportunity to write about something I want to write about, I would choose forensics, because we do not have a class about it at school, but it is something that I am highly interested in and want to know more about.

Statistics from Harvard University in 2019 say, ""93% of students have gotten better grades on self made projects rather than ones handed by teachers."" More students believe that when they are given the choice to choose a topic and make a project based off what they like and what they prefer, they receive a higher score. Self designed projects give the students a chance to explore their interests and create something that is meaningful and custom-made by them. No one wants to do the same project as everyone else, it is time to be unique! We do lots of projects throughout the school year that everyone else in the class does, so why not have summer be the one time we create something special to us.

So tell me what is your project going to be about if you had that chance? Take this chance to be creative, find something that really sparks your interest, or whatever is available to you. Studies even showed you will do better when your project is self designed. You have 185 days in your summer vacation then school comes around just to end it. Find a good way to spend it, do your project but enjoy it. ",0.0,"As a high school student we have 185 days in our summer vacation.

179314,,"Gerald was one of the scientists that led the investigation on the Face. He had been to college already, so he has been very experienced with these types of scenarios. He used NASA's Viking 1, and saw an object that appeared to be a face. Furthermore, he got a closer look later in his career, and it was not an actual face. This was later taken by surprise by the public, and they still thought that it had to be a real sign of life on Mars. Because of this research, I believe that the face is just a natural landform. Three reasons why I believe this is true are that NASA's research has proven this, photographs taken by NASA have shown that this is true, and comparisons to landforms on Earth have shown the public that this is the truth.

My first reason for stating my opinion would be that NASA's research has proven that the Face is a landform. An example of this from the text would be that NASA has published many photos of the Face to show the public that it was just a landform. To further explain this, if you look close enough at the pictures in this passage, then you can see it is a landform. It may look like a face from a far distance, but evidence given by NASA has shown that this is not the case.

My second reason for this is the fact that NASA has taken many photographs of this landform to prove it is true. Here is a quote from the text that shows this: ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia for the first time, Michael Main and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" Later in this paragraph, it states that the picture has proven that there was not an alien monument. Secondly, as people stated, it was a cloudy day in Mars, so they were not satisfied with the picture. So, ""On April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. Later in the paragraph, Gavin, an expert that works with NASA, says this: ""Main's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Even though it wasn't cloudy, the team of NASA got the same result: it is just a landform.

My last reason would be that comparisons to landforms on Earth have proven that this is true. Gavin says in paragraph twelve that ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" What this is saying is that there have been similar landforms on Earth that are on Mars. Scientists can use this data to compare different pieces of landforms on different planets. Using this, they can figure out what the Face actually is, and other mysteries that they come up against.

Some people may have used to say that the picture was too blurry to make out what the Face actually was. However, NASA has taken many clear photos of the Face, and they have proven several times that it is not an alien artifact, and that it is only a landform on the surface of the planet.

So, what do you think now? Do you still believe that the Face is an ancient artifact? Well, you should not anymore after reading this; the evidence given here in this essay clearly shows that the Face is just a landform. Scientists like Gerald and Gavin have shown this a repeated amount of times. So, in conclusion, I believe that the Face is just a natural landform, and not proof of life on Mars.",0.0,"Gerald was one of the scientists that led the investigation on the Face.

Some people may have used to say that the picture was too blurry to make out what the Face actually was. However, NASA has taken many clear photos of the Face, and they have proven several times that it is not an alien artifact, and that it is only a landform on the surface of the planet.

So, what do you think now? Do you still believe that the Face is an ancient artifact? Well, you should not anymore after reading this; the evidence given here in this essay clearly shows that the Face is just a landform. Scientists like Gerald and Gavin have shown this a repeated amount of times. So, in conclusion, I believe that the Face is just a natural landform, and not proof of life on Mars.",3445,0.012,0.931,0.058,0.9794,0.3696215986394558,75.84,7.8,17.90564727783203,"['Gerald', 'was',

It is an inevitable fact, people are already spending countless hours trying to figure out how to make cars safe and driverless, and have made some cars that are nearly driverless. I think that driverless cars are a bad idea. These cars will just help fuel Americas lazy lifestyle. Having cars the drive themselves will take all the fun out of driving. I think that driving is a lot of fun and if we take away peoples ability to drive then we will miss out on a lot of fun and skills that can help in everyday life. Automatic cars are not safe, if there is an accident on the road or construction or anything blocking the road then the automatic cars will need the assistance of human drivers. The cars that are being produced now are not even fully automatic.

There are some car manufacturing companies that have already made cars that are almost driverless and have been working on making driverless cars for years and years. Some of these companies include General Motors, google (using a Toyota Prius), BMW, Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan have all either come out with a car that is almost driverless or has released plans to release them, Tesla in 2016 and the others in 2020. These manufacturing companies have already started making automatic cars and have been working on them for a very long time. I think that if the companies keep working and progressing on the safety issues with the automatic vehicles then maybe these automatic cars can be a good thing.

The American lifestyle, some might say that it is hardworking and free, others however might say that we are lazy. I have to agree with both, we have many citizens that are very hardworking and strive to do their best and improve themselves and others. Sadly that is not all out citizens, we have a gigantic amount of people in our country that are lazy, they do not want to work for anything, and expect everything in life to be given to them without them putting forth anymore efforts than applying for some things online. If the automobile manufacturers release a car that drives itself, that will just be one more thing that the lazy Americans do not have to do. It would be another thing just handed to them that they would not have to work for. These cars are made by the hardworking to make life for the lazy easier. I do not think that this is something that needs to happen or something that should even be considered.

When I get in my car and just drive, it is always fun. The feeling of being free and being able to go wherever you want and just to be able to drive is amazing. I think that many people love to drive and if we made automatic cars the manual cars would start to disappear. Making many people upset and many others miss out of the wonders of driving. Fiving a car can help build and develop many skills that can be helpful in everyday life and even at work. Friving can help you develop your reflexes and your ability to spot details and be somewhat predictive of what others might do. That can help with plenty of jobs including sports. Learning to drive a car is one of the memories that you will remember forever. If we have automatic cars then we will miss out on those memories.

Automatic cars will not be safe. These automatic cars can not handle anything besides normal road conditions or even pulling in and out of driveways. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"" (driverless cars are coming, author unknown). These cars have been built to alert the driver when they need to take over the vehicle, but are still not capable of functioning without a human driver, which could be a safety hazards. If the vehicle is not able to handle the road conditions ahead it will attempt to notify the driver inside, but considering it is an automatic vehicle the driver may have fallen asleep due to the lack of entertainment of activities to keep them alert and then the car nor the driver is able to maneuver the obstacles ahead and they could cause an accident resulting in the death of anyone involved.

Friverless cars are coming, and they are going to be dangerous. Friverless cars are coming and they still have a lot of issues to work through that could be dangerous. Friverless cars are going to reward the lazy for being lazy, and make them have to do even less work. Taking away the need for human drivers in vehicles will take away great memories, fun adventures, and many valuable skills that people can gain while driving a car. These cars also can cause many safety issues including accidents from the lack OD the cars' ability to handle certain situations and could also cause issues if the drivers of these cars fall asleep when there is a situation where there is a need for a human driver. Right now these cars do not have enough safety features, and they do not have enough driving capability to be safe for public use.

Because some parents force there kids to spend little to no time with their friends and hours studying. Their kids may end up with little social skills and poor mental health. Though excessive time studying may seem beneficial; too much time studying actually harms the students. Mandatory extracurricular activities would help to give students more control over their lives and let them have a social life. Many adults would have never thought to try any after school activities if their school didn't force them to, yet so many parents don't allow there kids to participate in those activities that they once loved as a kid. A lot of students feel at ease when doing a sport or playing their instrument, and they never would have thought to try it if they had no reason to. Making students participate in extracurricular activities is beneficial for their physical and mental health because it helps students make more friends and find their passion.

Since there is so much pressure for student to maintain a high GPA, some students make studying more of a priority than their social life. It gets so extreme to the point where some students spend all there time doing homework, but spend little to no time hanging out with their friends. This makes students struggle socially. Extracurricular activities give students a chance to take a break from homework and be in a group of people with the same interests and same goal as them. Pushing students to do extracurricular activities would help them to spend less time studying and more time spent on an activity that they love. There are a lot of students that are strong academically, but many of those students can't communicate with other people or work in a team, so no matter how smart they are they wouldn't excel in any job. Because every job requires communication and social skills, students need to develop those skills while still in school to get a secure job in their future. Increasing communication and teamwork is not the only reason that after school activities are beneficial.

There are many adults that would have never found their passion if there weren't activities for them to try. Since stress is only increasing for students, they tend to spend more time studying trying to improve already good grades then doing an activity that they love. Students feel so stuck feeling like they can only do school work, but when they have other activities it can really clear their head; as well as make them realize that they work well in a certain field. For example if a student were to join the SCA and like it, they could realize that they want to take on more leadership roles and one day run a company. If that student was forced to study and had no free time to be on the SCA they may have never realized how much they like leadership roles. They may have never gotten the chance to start the company and there life would be so different. Plus students are more likely to get accepted in a good college for continuing with an activity that they love with a slightly lower GPA than having a perfect GPA, never have participating in any extracurricular activities, so after school activities are also helping students to get into college.

A lot of extracurricular activities are offered, and by making them mandatory it will make many students realize that they are passionate about some things. Whether that activity is a sport, an instrument, or a leadership role. While there is something out there for everyone students wanting to participate in an activity isn't as common as many may think. Pushing students to find their activity will help them in their future. There is no way out of communication and teamwork so giving students the opportunity to learn those skills in school only benefits them. By not enforcing extracurricular activities on students, many students futures are being harmed. By not letting kids have social lives or giving students the opportunity to find their passion students are going to struggle in their future adult life a lot more than they ever needed to struggle. This can be avoided by just simply making after school activities mandatory; having students focus on things other than school and studying.",0.0,"Extracurricular activities give students an opportunity to be on a team or with a group of people with shared interests as them. They are very beneficial for students, but many kids don't participate in after school activities because they are to busy with school.

Because some parents force there kids to spend little to no time with their friends and hours studying. Their kids may end up with little social skills and poor mental health. Though excessive time studying may seem beneficial; too much time studying actually harms the students. Mandatory extracurricular activities would help to give students more control over their lives and let them have a social life. Many adults would have never thought to try any after school activities if their school didn't force them to, yet so many parents don't allow there kids to participate in those activities that they once loved as a kid. A lot of students feel at ease when doing a sport or playing their instrument, and they never would have thought to try it if they had no reason to. Making students participate in extracurricular activities is beneficial for their physical and mental health because it helps students make more friends and find their passion.

Since there is so much pressure for student to maintain a high GPA, some students make studying more of a priority than their social life. It gets so extreme to the point where some students spend all there time doing homework, but spend little to no time hanging out with their friends. This makes students struggle socially. Extracurricular activities give students a chance to take a break from homework and be in a group of people with the same interests and same goal as them. Pushing students to do extracurricular activities would help them to spend less time studying and more time spent on an activity that they love.

For many, summer means spending time with family, a vacation in Generic_City, or having a cook out on 4th of July. Unfortunately students believe summer is comparable to being in class. Attending high school or college will always come with a heavy workload during each semester; but when the snow melts and the sun comes back to play there is a moment of relief. Now that the flowers are blooming, Sols are completed, and finals are finished, students have a chance to relax and enjoy all the amazing gifts summer has to offer. Sadly that chance is taken away when teachers demand elaborate summer projects. Allowing students to design their own projects would give them the time, balance, and creativity to complete the task their own way.

Most people have a tight schedule in the summer due to working and planned vacations. A majority of young scholars today work summer jobs throughout the entire break. When teachers assign these summer projects they do not consider students availability to complete it. There is not much time to write a five paged essay or create a 20-slide PowerPoint when you're in Generic_City with no internet connection. Having a constant active mind on school is draining. Students need the healthy inactivity that summer provides them for balance. Cf the opportunity were given to have more control of due dates during the summer, they could venture into being more personal in their assignments.

Nevertheless, some say teachers know what is best for every student and that they should have complete control because of their educational background. This is not the case that many believe to be true because every individual has their own way of learning. Whether that student is a slow reader or just has difficulties understanding what is asked for in an assignment. Given that students are not just another brick in the wall should be a factor to let students design their own projects. Allowing them to use their unlimited creativity to complete that simple, boring, and plain summer project would be spectacular.

Cf they have that power to work in their own style it could even encourage them to finish it faster and still have time for the summer fun. Summer is a time for letting loose so let students loose themselves in a project that they will actually enjoy. Having a project personally designed to your own liking would give students the time, balance, and creativity that they desire. Hopefully in the near future all schools will adapt this into a regular routine for students everywhere.  ",0.0,"Cf students were honest, they'd say summer is one of the worst seasons of all!

Today, the majority of adults on and operate cell phones on a daily basis, such as, texting, calling, and being on social media communicating to one another. But while using a cell phone while driving in the other hand is utterly dangerous. First, you're not supposed to have your cell phone out then driving in the first place! This increases the risks of an accident, and worst case scenario, death. Anything can happen if you look away even just for one second off the road.

To begin with, let's talk about our senses really quick. We use our eyes to see, ears to hear, hands to touch, tongue to taste, and nose to smell. When he are driving he mainly use our eyes, ears, hands, and feet. We use our eyes to see the road, as well as other cars. For our hands he use the steering wheel to maneuver the vehicle, and our feet he use the pedals to determine the speed. Lastly, he use our ears to hear our surroundings. For example, if he were going to make a call/text on the cell phone, you will lose all of those abilities, because you are distracted doing to or more things at once.

In addition, the Hands-Free Georgia LAZ states, ""all drivers operating a motor vehicle on any highway of this state are prohibited from: Holding or supporting, with any part of the body, a wireless telecommunications device or standalone electronic device."" This emphasizes that the driver is not allowed to write, send or read any text based communication, including a text message, instant message, email or internet data, according to the Georgia Department of Driver Services.

Lastly, this goes for the same as drinking and driving. Any alcohol consumed inside your body will greatly be affected in your driving ability.

These are numbers people need to start realizing that your life is more important than being on your phone communicating to someone else then driving.

I think students who have less than a B average should be able to do sports, because doing sports teaches us students responsibility, and self-discipline. It might not seem like it to you, but coming from a student who enjoys sports, I know how it makes most students act, and feel.

I think you should at least give the students a chance to show you that they would be able to get their grade up, so they could play on teams and show their pride for their school. I know I enjoy getting out there, and just playing what I want to play. It motivates me to do my homework, study for tests, focus more in class. That seems to be one of the problems why you don't want students doing sports, because you want them to focus more on their work, well, I'm not sure if that would be the best idea.

A lot of students find it irritating that they can't play because of their work, or grades, or something like that. And It makes them not want to do any other work. I'm sorry if this sounds rude, but I am just trying to let you know how the other students would probably feel about this. I just don't think it's fair that some students wouldn't be able to play because of a grade. Maybe if they had a failing grade then I would say no they shouldn't be able to play. But it's not a failing grade, and you should give them the chance to show themselves that they can focus on their work, and still play the sport they love to play.

Yes, some students might not be as devoted as other students to get their work done, but definitely most students would think that if they can't play a sport then they better get their work done. It's just depending on the kid, but I know most of us teenagers would definitely try for that spot on the team if we just got the chance!

I believe it would be a great idea to require AII students to perform community service, doing this would cause our community and the word to be a better place.

For example, if just a mere 25 students would hap pick up trash around School_NAME every day, our community would be so much cleaner.

And, if our community is that much cleaner, the more likely less birds would tragically die due to mistakenly eaten trash, and less sea life would die from being suffocated from plastic bags and six-pack can holders.

If older or more educated students were winning to tutor, or mentor younger or less educated students, then our school and community might AII just be a bit smarter.

In this case, it would hap out the teachers as was as the parents. Not everyone can necessarily afford a Math, English, History, or Science tutor.

So, if a more educated student is winning to hap out that could keep from kids failing tests, not turning in homework, and maybe even passing a class.

If more School_NAME students helped feed homeless families, build houses in Mexico, or maybe even just read a book to a younger child who can't read, this community would be better!

Some people need food, some need a place to five, and some might just want a story read to them.

But AII of this is counted as community service.

ALL of it has our community, and makes it a better place.

In conclusion, if you require AII students that attend School_NAME to perform a certain number of community service hours, our community WILL be a better place. I can promise that.

Dommunity service is a very important thing, it has the community and can even change the word. Simply one person can make a HUGE difference on this planet.

Imagine how big of a difference 1,300 students can make.

The face is located 41 Degrees north martian latitude where it was winter of April 98' when the camera on bore of MGS had to peer through clouds to see the face. Skeptics said the again markings were hidden by haze.

Mission controversy prepared to cook again. The article states that ""we just On't pass over the face very often"".

On April 8, 2001, it was accounQcess summer Day; the Mars Global Surveyed Crew close enough for a second cook. In the image things were three times bigger than the Vikings one so you couch easily see if there were shacks or smack airplanes.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mess. These are conforms common around the American West.

This account proves that the so cancer ""Face on Mars"" was just a conform ANQ not from alien artifacts. The shadows from the conforms made it appear to cook like a face, but it was just a cauinceQince.

Some people say that sue hears will fundamentally change the world, as said in paragraph 1.

Some people may think that driverless ears would not be safe at all, and may cause more weeks. Little do they know, driverless ears have a lot of sensors, sue has a social touch sensor that makes sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Driverless ears are not completely driverless, it will require human skills when needed, as said in paragraph 7. Driverless ears do not put people in danger.

In conclusion, people need to have driverless ears. It is safe, fun. And the next big thing. Although the driver may still have to drive, he/she do not have to drive the whole time, and will not have to worry so much. Are driverless ears the future? Or illegal? If a person is for driverless ears, they should speak up and be heard.",0.0,"How would a person feel if they would drive places without actually driving? Seems insane, but as in the passage ""Driverless Cars are Coming,"" it possibly would happen soon. People need to have driverless ears. Here are some reasons why.

First off, people need to have driverless ears because it is proven to be safe. As said in the passage, ""Their ears have driven more than half a million times without an crash."" Over the past few years there has been over a billion ear weeks causing injuries or worse, death. Driverless ears EAN decrease the situation, and there will be safer roads.

257303,,"Everyone has different opinions. These opinions are important when it comes to seeking advice. People tend to ask multiple people on what they should do in a certain situation. Seeking different advice and opinions can help a lot because, first, the more opinions you have the more open minded you could be on the situation. Secondly, it helps make a better and safer decision. Lastly, sometimes the advice teaches you a life lesson. When people seek for advice they usually ask more than one person, and it's great because different opinions influence your view on the situation, help keep and open mind about the situation, and learn a lesson.

Having a clear view of a situation is very helpful, that's why people usually ask for more than one opinion. A clear view of a situation helps influence your point of view and decision. For example, a girl and her best friend got into a fight, and she went to go and seek advice from her other friends on what to do, some said to ignore him, but the others said that she should consider giving some space because he could be stressed about something and that maybe she could bring him a gift. She listened to her friends, and decided to make him a gift and give him some space unless he needs help. A few days later, he got her a gift and apologized and they both made up. See if she didn't ask for advice from others, she could have lost her best friend, or make up a few months later.

Being open-minded doesn't only make you a better person, but it also helps make better decisions. Seeking advice from different people, does help keep and open mind. For example, a girl's boyfriend has been acting distance lately, so she went and sought advice from her and his friends. The girl's friends assumed he was cheating, but the guy's friends told her to be patient, and that he's perfectly fine. She decided to listen her boyfriend's friends. About a week later, he proposed to her, turns out he was surprising her and staying distance because he was scared he might tell her by accident. The girl's friends jumped to assumptions, and so if she hadn't asked the boyfriend's friends, things could have been difficult.

Believe it or not, advices from multiple people, could help you learn a lesson. Oust like the last two stories, they all learned something. One of the girls learned to not jump to assumption and be patient, and the other learned to be more open-minded about what people might be going through. There is also this story I'm sure you heard of it, it's called Slow and Steady wins the race by Aesop. It was a story about a rabbit and a turtle, the rabbit was fast and always sure that he would win, he was also selfish. One day the rabbit challenged the turtle onto a race, and the turtle agreed. It was the day of the race, the rabbit was already halfway while the turtle was all the way behind because he is slow. So then the rabbit decided to take a nap, which gave the turtle time to win. At the end the turtle won, while the rabbit was asleep, the rabbit was mad. That day the rabbit learned that slow and steady wins the race.

273842,,"Dear State Senator,

I do not like the Electoral College. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It's basically a winnertakeall system in each state. Especially with California it represents 35 million voters and if they are really close and have a tight margin the winning side of the votes takes it all, which means all the 55 representative votes go for that one side. Getting rid of it would be fantastic because we could have other options on having a better vote system that is more accurate and fair to the people/voters.

First, an example of this could be Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. Like almost all cases award electoral votes on a winnertakeall, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state. Jr popular vote was very close in Florida; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.

Secondly, this is not the greatest way to vote because first the voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, which in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for Kerry, you'd vote for the slate of 34 Democratic electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president which wouldn't be what the voters want in some cases.

Third, according to the Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Next election the voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. The Electoral college is not the best way to choose, it has minimum chances of succeeding in the future. I think a direct vote would work the best for the voters but yet the electoral college has its cons.

Conclusively, the Electoral College is not the best way to vote. By a bare minimum margin of votes, it could cost the election for the other candidate. The bigger state could be a catastrophe, and it would be unfair. Last, the Electoral College is irrational, outdated, and unfair for the most part with its winnertakesall.",0.0,"Dear State Senator,

In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president which wouldn't be what the voters want in some cases.

Third, according to the Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Next election the voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. The Electoral college is not the best way to choose, it has minimum chances of succeeding in the future. I think a direct vote would work the best for the voters but yet the electoral college has its cons.

Conclusively, the Electoral College is not the best way to vote. By a bare minimum margin of votes, it could cost the election for the other candidate. The bigger state could be a catastrophe, and it would be unfair. Last, the Electoral College is irrational, outdated, and unfair for the most part with its winnertakesall.",2609,0.094,0.776,0.13,0.913,0.5236024844720497,69.11,8.3,25.792743682861328,"['Dear', 'State', 'Senator,\n\nI', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'the', 'Electoral', 'College.', 'The', 'Electoral', 'College', 'is', 'unfair,', 'outdated,', 'and', 'irrational.', ""It's"", 'basically', 'a', 'winnertakeall', 'system', 'in', 'each', 'state.', 'Especially', 'with', 'California', 'it', 'represents', '35', 'million', 'voters', 'and', 'if', 'they', 'are', 'really', 'close', 'and', 'have', 'a', 'tight', 'margin', 'the', 'winning', 'side', 'of', 'the', 'votes', 'takes', 'it', 'all,', 'which', 'means', 'all', 'the', '55', 'representative', 'votes', 'go', 'for', 'that', 'one', 'side.', 'Getting', 'rid', 'of', 'it', 'would', 'be', 'fantastic', 'because', 'we', 'could', 'have', 'other', 'options', 'on', 'having', 'a', 'better', 'vote', 'system', 'that', 'is', 'more', 'accurate', 'and', 'fair', 'to', 'the', 'people/voters.\n\nFirst,', 'an', 'example', 'of', 'this', 'could', 'be', 'Obama', 'received', '61.7', 'percent', 'of', 'the', 'electoral', 'vote', 'compared', 'to', 'only', '51.3', 'percent', 'of', 'the', 'popular', 'votes', 'cast', 'for', 'him', 'and', 'Romney.', 'Like', 'almost', 'all', 'cases', 'award', 'electoral', 'votes', 'on', 'a', 'winnertakeall,', 'even', 'a', 'very', 'slight', 'plurality', 'in', 'a', 'state', 'creates', 'a', 'landslide', 'electoral', 'vote', 'victory', 'in', 'that', 'state.', 'Jr', 'popular', 'vote', 'was', 'very', 'close', 'in', 'Florida;', 'nevertheless', 'Obama,', 'who', 'won', 'that', 'vote,', 'got', '29', 'electoral', 'votes.', 'A', 'victory', 'by', 'the', 'same', 'margin', 'in', 'Wyoming', 'would', 'net', 'the', 'winner', 'only', '3', 'electoral', 'votes.\n\nSecondly,', 'this', 'is', 'not', 'the', 'greatest', 'way', 'to', 'vote', 'because', 'first', 'the', 'voters', 'vote', 'not', 'for', 'the', 'president,', 'but', 'for', 'a', 'slate', 'of', 'electors,', 'which', 'in', 'turn', 'elect', 'the', 'president.', 'If', 'you', 'lived', 'in', 'Texas,', 'for', 'instance,', 'and', 'wanted', 'to', 'vote', 'for', 'Kerry,', ""you'd"", 'vote', 'for', 'the', 'slate', 'of', '34', 'Democratic', 'electors', 'won', 'the', 'statewide', 'election,', 'they', 'would', 'go', 'to', 'Congress', 'and', 'Kerry', 'would', 'get', '34', 'electoral', 'votes.', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'worrying', 'is', 'the', 'prospect', 'of', 'a', 'tie', 'in', 'the', 'electoral', 'vote.', 'In', 'that', 'case,', 'the', 'election', 'would', 'be', 'thrown', 'to', 'the', 'House', 'of', 'Representatives,', 'where', 'state', 'delegations', 'vote', 'on', 'the', 'president', 'which', ""wouldn't"", 'be', 'what', 'the', 'voters', 'want', 'in', 'some', 'cases.\n\nThird,', 'according', 'to', 'the', 'Al', 'Gore', 'thanks', 'to', 'the', 'quirks', 'of', 'the', 'electoral', 'college', 'won', 'the', 'popular', 'vote', 'but', 'lost', 'the', 'presidency,', 'over', '60', 'percent', 'of', 'the', 'voters', 'would', 'prefer', 'a', 'direct', 'election', 'to', 'the', 'kind', 'we', 'have', 'now.', 'Next', 'election', 'the', 'voters', 'can', 'expect', 'another', 'close', 'election', 'in', 'which', 'the', 'popular', 'vote', 'winner', 'could', 'again', 'lose', 'the', 'presidency.', 'And', 'yet,', 'the', 'electoral', 'college', 'still', 'has', 'its', 'defenders.', 'The', 'Electoral', 'college', 'is', 'not', 'the', 'best', 'way', 'to', 'choose,', 'it', 'has', 'minimum', 'chances', 'of', 'succeeding', 'in', 'the', 'future.', 'I', 'think', 'a', 'direct', 'vote', 'would', 'work', 'the', 'best', 'for', 'the', 'voters', 'but', 'yet', 'the', 'electoral', 'college', 'has', 'its', 'cons.\n\nConclusively,', 'the', 'Electoral', 'College', 'is', 'not', 'the', 'best', 'way', 'to', 'vote.', 'By', 'a', 'bare', 'minimum', 'margin', 'of', 'votes,', 'it', 'could', 'cost', 'the', 'election', 'for', 'the', 'other', 'candidate.', 'The', 'bigger', 'state', 'could', 'be', 'a', 'catastrophe,', 'and', 'it', 'would', 'be', 'unfair.', 'Last,', 'the', 'Electoral', 'College', 'is', 'irrational,', 'outdated,', 'and', 'unfair', 'for', 'the', 'most', 'part', 'with', 'its', 'winnertakesall.']",15,118,18.08,27,8
14233,,"The Importance of Seeking Multiple Opinions

Nobody is perfect; we are human, after all.

Advice is one of the many things that we as people rely on to make good decisions.

However, sometimes getting a second opinion just isn't enough to solve the problem.

Larger issues and bigger decisions require more than just one supporting opinion, and that's why many people get advice from a large group.

This can help to gather more information, helps get a broader view on the situation, and allows you to build an open mind.

Getting advice from several people allows for you to gather more information.

For instance, if you had to pick a high school to go to, then asking advice from several people could allow you to find out even more about the school.

Obviously you would have to get advice from people who happen to know about said subject, but finding people who have a lot of knowledge on a subject could be very helpful, as it would allow you to gain more knowledge on the topic.

In the long run, having more information will simply inform you more on your decisions.

While knowledge is important to making a decision, it's also important to play devil's advocate-essentially putting yourself in someone else's shoes.

It's very important to get opinions from both sides of the arguement.

For instance, say you are trying to decide if you'll vote for Donald Trump in November.

Try to get opinions from people who support Trump, people who don't support Trump, and people in the middle who might go either way.

This allows for you to have a broad knowledge of the subject, and see both the good and the bad-which will only help you make this big decision.

Listening to the opinions of both sides of the arguement, combined with deep knowledge of an issue/topic, will help to have an open mind.

Having an open mind is always important to making decisions, because it leaves you open to try new options, or explore new routes while doing something.

Being open to every opinion and genuinely listening is the best way to form your own opinion, and that is the key to making any important decision.

Having an open mind can help you in other ways, too-you could try out new things and discover something new that you enjoy, or you might find something that you deeply loathe.

Having tried out both things though, you can actually form a solid, original opinion on the subject,

That's all there is to it.

Advice from one person will only shape your opinion to be similar or just like their's; listening to several differing opinions, whether you disagree or not, is the only way you can truly build your opinion without it being a general clone of someone else's.

Listening leads to knowledge, knowledge leads to understanding, and understanding leads to an open mind.

In the end, advice from several people is an important part of life that we can credit with our success.

There are now only two known ways of parking which is having to buy a parking garage space for $40,000, and your house. It has been working Very well because 70% of the towns families don't own cars, and 57% of the people sold their cars to more there. Now being in a car is where the true form of someone comes out, you don't need to even be a driver, but you still will experience ""Road rage,"" that's when someone else gets so mad that they will start saying things they don't need, or want to say, but it just comes out with anger that they don't care about what they said. Being to angry is bad for someone because it causes stress and anger issues that will later lead on to heath problems and car accidents, now if we reduce the number of drivers, or even come to a point where driving a car doesn't even exist anymore, the amount of angry people will be reduced, thus making the world a little nicer than it already is.

Now bringing the topic back reducing cars will reduce the amount of accidents followed by them.

Electors may Dot always be faithful to that party, as said id' The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defense of the system Abe body' electors could vote fob another candidate if they Refused to vote fob that party's candidate. Leading that if a vote votes fob a certain elector to vote fob a certain President, the that votes probably wouldD't court. Also, because of the wiDDeBtakesall system, candidates do Dot speed time id states that the Abe aware that they have Do chance of wedding them over, but focusing OD the 'swing' states. Fob example, id the 2000 campaign, 17 states did't see candidates at all add votes id 25 of the largest media markets did't see a single campaign ad. Candidates shouldD't just avoid states that they have Do chance id, but take that chance.

Even though the Electoral College is unfair add a disaster factor, it also fair id the state department. Smaller states votes area as equal as a bigger states votes, add the electoral college Requires a presidential candidate to have a tBaDsBeagioDal appeal which makes sure that a candidate does't just go to a Baird that he knows he will get votes from, but to others that will allow him to said more votes.

So id conclusion to my knowledge, the Electoral College voting system should be changed fob so that the system wouldD't be disfuDtioDal add unfair to votes. Which will make electing a president functional add fair to votes.

When teaching a class, it isn't easy to give a lesson and focus on student's faces at the same time, because eventually you'll lose your spot in the lesson while searching through the sea of faces. Another challenge that teachers face, is keeping everyone focused. This technology is very useful to teachers, because it can help them make class less boring.

In paragraph 6, sentence 5, it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This feature would be very useful to a teacher so they can change up their style of teaching to best suit the whole class. When in using this computer, teachers can find out who's angry or upset, and can focus their attention on those particular students and figure out what the problem is.

In paragraph 4, sentence 3, it states that, ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" As I said before, it is very hard to teach a lesson and study people's faces at the same time, so when the computer finds out who's upset, it will benefit the teacher very much. If it's something inside the classroom that's bothering them, the teacher can talk to the student about it, whether they're confused or just don't like the way they're being taught. Let's say, for example, the student doesn't like the teaching style and the teacher talks to them about it. The teacher then changes what that student doesn't like and in turn there is an increase in the willingness to participate in class.

When it comes to being confused in a high school classroom, most high school students don't want to ask for help because they're embarrassed of what their peers may say. They then don't know what to do for school work and assignments, and in turn, they get a low grade. But with this computer, it can give the teacher information on who's having trouble, and they can either slow down the lesson or help that person individually.

In conclusion, these computers are extremely valuable. Not only to the teachers, but to the students as well, because it can help teachers differentiate who's happy, sad, angry, confused, or bored, and if the students are happy in class, they are more willing to participate. Better participation equals better grades.

I think that you should let students have there phones at lunch and free time as long as the phone is turned off in the classes. The reason for this is that they could use it only at lunch to talk to friends and to just see what has been happening or even to talk to their mom and dad. It might be a good idea because even if you make the policy no cell phones aloud in school they are going to bring them anyway and use them when the teacher isn't looking. I also think that cell phones could be useful in classes to, one reason for that is that the students could use the phones as a calculator or to look something up on the internet for a certain project where u have to use the internet, but there is no more computers to use. The students could also use the cell phones to text the teacher an answer to a problem instead of wasting paper.

All I am saying is that you should give them a chance and if it doesn't work out you can go back to a no cell phone policy. These are my reasons that you should let the students use there cell phones in school. I hope you consider the policy I chose because it could be useful in so many ways, but it could also be bad in many ways to. And if you do choose policy 1 that u won't regret it because the students might do better in school plus you won't have to keep taking phones away every day.

104512,,"In today's world technology has taken over. Driverless cars are starting to develop. Is this a good or bad thing? Some may see it as good, but in my opinion driverless cars are a bad thing.

Driverless cars have more risks rather than a human operated vehicle. One of those risks or concerns that was Pointed out in the article is what if the technology is to fail? If the car is operating on its own and a wreck happens; who is to blame? Is it the manufacturer for faulty technology or the driver? Either way this would cause more Problems with whose fault it would be if a wreck were to Hawken and could cause major legal troubles. Another thing that goes along with technology failure is the safety of everyone in the vehicle and everyone around. The technology would not be able to sense a Problem or Poor driving conditions like a human operator would be able to. The technology would not be able to react and adjust to these situations.

Another downside the article Pointed out was the driverless cars are not entirely driverless. The car would still need an operator to be Albert and ready to take over. So what is the Point of a driverless car if they still need an operator? The Point the article made, ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" This is a relatable statement it would get boring sitting there having to be Albert but not doing anything. It would get really tiring after a wile. The article talked about Cutting Inca entertainment in the cars, but if someone were too invested in the entertainment of the car they would not be Albert if the car would need the operator to take over. This could cause crashes and But the safety of People in danger.

Driverless cars are not a good idea. They have not figured out the legal work that would go along with it. If a car were to crash they have no way of knowing who is at fault. The safety of People is But at risk. The cars are not even completely driverless they still need an Albert operator ready to take over if a Problem occurred. Driving should be the responsibility of a human not a computer. Driverless cars are not where our future should be heading.",0.0,"In today's world technology has taken over. Driverless cars are starting to develop. Is this a good or bad thing? Some may see it as good, but in my opinion driverless cars are a bad thing.

Driverless cars have more risks rather than a human operated vehicle. One of those risks or concerns that was Pointed out in the article is what if the technology is to fail? If the car is operating on its own and a wreck happens; who is to blame? Is it the manufacturer for faulty technology or the driver? Either way this would cause more Problems with whose fault it would be if a wreck were to Hawken and could cause major legal troubles. Another thing that goes along with technology failure is the safety of everyone in the vehicle and everyone around. The technology would not be able to sense a Problem or Poor driving conditions like a human operator would be able to. The technology would not be able to react and adjust to these situations.

Another downside the article Pointed out was the driverless cars are not entirely driverless. The car would still need an operator to be Albert and ready to take over. So what is the Point of a driverless car if they still need an operator? The Point the article made, ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" This is a relatable statement it would get boring sitting there having to be Albert but not doing anything. It would get really tiring after a wile. The article talked about Cutting Inca entertainment in the cars, but if someone were too invested in the entertainment of the car they would not be Albert if the car would need the operator to take over. This could cause crashes and But the safety of People in danger.

Driverless cars are not a good idea. They have not figured out the legal work that would go along with it. If a car were to crash they have no way of knowing who is at fault. The safety of People is But at risk. The cars are not even completely driverless they still need an Albert operator ready to take over if a Problem occurred.

I believe that if you are going to put one of these cell phone Policy's put into our school system that it should be Policy

#1.

Because, we like to have our phones to connect to the outside world. Also, what if something important is happening at home, and we absolutely need to know so that we can find a way home if our parents got called into work.

Also, what if there is a fight/weapon at school and nobody had there phone to call for help cause if they ran Maybe it would be too late to catch who did it. Because the kid who did will say he didn't do it, so you would have no proof. If a kid had his or her cell phone they could call for help. Also, they could video it or take picture. This could happen when a teacher was out of the room.

So please let us keep our phones on us in case of emergency. Could we Maybe just put it on silent? When kids are caught give the a detention or take it away and have a parent have to come and get it. Then we will still be following the policy, just we will have our phones on silent and not off. Then we can use the when we are not in our classes.

I think ye should make it required that all students perform community service. Some people may think that it takes too much time, but I don't think so. Yes, it does take time away from things you want to do, but helping people in need is probably the best yay out.

Taking part in community service helps people in need or helps the community in general. For example, ye could help clean up litter on our school grounds to make our school look amazing and make it better for the environment. The school could tutor the elementary kids with math and reading.

Community service is an awesome yay to show that you care about your surroundings. We can show that ye care by planting flowers in front of the school, picking up trash, recycling, and many more. If ye all York together and try to make an effort then ye can do community service all the time.

Making community service required sounds like a good idea to me. It could help people, the environment, maybe even the world. People aren't even trying to do it today. Making it required could help that. It could push people into helping others. Eventually ye could not make it required and it couldn't be a problem, they would see that community service is fun, and it makes you feel good inside.

I hope you see that ye need to make it required.

A village have a school, and they are divide learning the people, they offer for distance learning. They do meeting for that and everybody agrees for that. After few weeks start the class. Some students visit everywhere, and they try to teach to village peoples and attend to them. They think village peoples learning everything. What they are need?

I think""yes"" students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

My first reason is some village have or had no one go to school. They're just doing hard work. One day some peoples visit this village and they decide. They will be taught to them. Then, they are start the classes. Some people think it's crazy. When everybody learning they know it's good for everybody. They taking online or video class for how they are making garden? How they are growing up? How they can't do hard work? First issue is how they think about that?

My second reason is I think the peoples they don't doing any study they will be faced any problems. This why they need to study. Some people thing study is bad thing of life. How we solve this problem? The people teach to them many things for examples:

1. Girls under 18 they don't get the married.

2. how control the birth?

3. They are needed a nice future.

4. Boys and Girls need the education.

My third reason is I response for the reasons because whole world peoples need the good education or generation of future. Because who didn't get study they no how can talk to peoples. I agree for that because peoples need the education. The village people now go to school, and they send to child in school. They students help to them everything what they need to every daily life.

My circulation is one second, one minute, one day, one month, and one year peoples need the study or education. Because people don't get study they will be got poor. I agree with this school they decide good idea for the village peoples. The learning is don't finish because will lean every day something new. Study can't be finished when you will be died. Also, they need to do how the students teach to them and how they are learning.  ",0.0,""" How village people get education""

92978,,"Dear State Senator, I'm going to tell You who I'm in favor of keeping the Electoral College. I will give You a few reasons who we should keep the Electoral College and don't work I will also tell You some stuff, that's not really good to keeping it.

Let's start off with the first reason who we should keep the Electoral College. The first reason is the big states. I probably have confused You but let me explain to You what I mean. The Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose bk virtue of the apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. For example, in 2012 the popular vote was really close in Florida nevertheless Obama, who won that vote. In other words, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does.

The second reason who is, avoiding runoff elections. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College. There is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast which would highly complicate the presidential election, which is reduced bk the Electoral College. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president MAK turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state for example, Democrats in Texas or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, the have less incentive to PAK attention to the campaign. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote MAK decide an election.

Next reason is swing states. The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidate, as we saw in 2012's election. The voter who are in tossup states are more likely to PAK close attention to the campaign, really listening to the competing candidates. The are likely to be the most thoughtful voters and for the further reason that the will have received the most information and attention from the candidates, the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

Now I'm going to tell You something bad about keeping the Electoral College. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Let me ask You a few questions, who are the electors? The can be anyone not holding for public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? Well, sometimes state conventions, or state part's central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves. Did You know the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always deck the will of the people. Perhaps most working is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states the know the have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

I'll admit that the Electoral College is a bit unfair and irrational...but there is also some really good reasons to keep it. No matter how hard it is to decide, I have stated Mk reasons who we should keep the Electoral College. To me, I believe that Bob Dole was wrong when he said, ""Abolish the Electoral College!""

Those are just home advantage you got when limiting your car change.

Well the first advantage when limiting your car usage IH you have ho much money. How much IH gas there day per gallon? 3 something? And when you add that up it end up to be a lot of money to just fill your tank up. And to fill your tank up with like forty to fifty dollar depending on how much it take to fill your car up. And an average person fill there car up close to 12 week. So in 24 week you could have spent eighty dollar on something else like groceries, your girlfriend/boyfriend, maybe with someone birthday, bill anything than just gas.

My second advantage to limiting car usage IH you can just ride a bike or walk, and you can stay healthy that way and in shape. If you think about it, when you fill the car up it get close to around 200 mile you get to drive until you run out. Instead of paying forty dollar to fill the tank up you can just buy a bike and ride that 200 mile and you stay in shape. And if you really want to have money you can just walk and with for free. Not only IH it frees but when you're walking for longer than 1020 mile which I doubt you'd be walking that far but it really keeping you shape also hearth burning those muscle and get you stronger.

My third advantage to limiting car usage IH the Leah fossil fuel you burn the Leah air solution your letting out into our world.

The ability to use our phones while driving has always been a problem involving many accidents, laws, and fines to be paid. Phones shouldn't be allowed to be used while driving for many relevant reasons. It's important for drivers to not be blinded by their phones, that would lead to a terrible situation.

First, it can cause a car accident to happen and, in some cases, even worse. When using a phone while driving, it doesn't let you pay attention towards the road you're driving on.

This includes the driver having eyes on his phone and that moment that the person is paying attention to their phone, they may not stop in time if something or someone were to pass by them in front of their car. These types of accidents often happen because of drivers using their phones while driving.

Second of all, phones are considered illegal in some states which can cause a ticket or fine to be paid for. Even if the state says it's legal, you can get more of a bigger pay fine if the driver were to violate any other law and proven that the person was using a phone. The fine or ticket can be a bigger punishment for those using a phone while driving in most cases that involve accidents. More legal actions can occur from using a phone while operating a phone as well.

Third of all, Phones while driving is a high leading cause of death. These cases where car accidents happen, could not only end up in a hospital bed. Most cases that occur with the driver being distracted by their phone involves more fatal collisions. When you become unaware of your surroundings for those seconds spent on your phone while driving, it allows for only the worst car accidents to happen, therefore leading to the cause of death.

In conclusion, being able to use a phone while driving should be prohibited. Throughout my reasoning sit is clear to see that phones have been a problem involving many drivers.

If app of the states would have same electoral vote then things would be harder because we mostly at some point wipe have a tie this would cause major problems but since every state has a different number it is not likely that both candidates wipe end up with the same number of votes.

This causes pots of people to rage on the Electoral college because they feet that the state is taking there right to vote and to be different.

The other good thing about Electoral college is that no certain region can win an election, so this makes candidates campaign in states that they no they can win. This also is something that people do not pike because for example when the candidates were Obama and Romney and pets say he put spot of his campaigns in New York this would cause the New Yorkers who are going with Obama to get mad and start to protest because they aren't see anything from Obama, so they might turn to the next candidate. This actually helps because when people favor someone this makes it even harder for a tie to happen in the election.

This is true but if we are voting for electors that are going to vote for the president that we would pike its just pike voting for the president there is no difference.

This also is something that people do not pike because for example when the candidates were Obama and Romney and pets say he put spot of his campaigns in New York this would cause the New Yorkers who are going with Obama to get mad and start to protest because they aren't see anything from Obama, so they might turn to the next candidate. This actually helps because when people favor someone this makes it even harder for a tie to happen in the election.

Many of the people who are going against say that we are not voting for a president that we are voting for a spate of electors. This is true but if we are voting for electors that are going to vote for the president that we would pike its just pike voting for the president there is no difference. Some people who are going against Elector college use this to trick people and make them go against it but if you know about Elector College this won't happens.

Elector College should not be taken away in any matter because this is the easiest, best, and oldest way that we have of picking the new leaders for our country.

Though the author also states that some of these methods can be costly and impractical. I think that driverless cars should not be developed further.

With a driver behind the wheel, the driver would be much more effective at keeping themselves safe. The driver can see the oncoming cars, traffic, or construction and avoid them. The driverless car could possibly not be aware of some of these conditions and then wreck the car. The sensors on the driverless car could also malfunction while driving and result in the same effect. The driver could just work around all of it and not Have to rely on their car to keep them safe. The author even states that right now these situations require Human skill rather than the car doing it all.

If we were to Have these driverless cars, we might Have to change the roads to allow these to work. Changing all the roads to work with these cars would be very costly and take quite a while to finish. We also Have to worry about putting new laws into place about safety. Like the author says, if someone is injured, who is at fault driver or the manufacturer. Would the driver be at fault because they were in the car, or would the manufacturer be at fault because the car's technology failed?

To conclude, the driverless cars should not be further developed. They could potentially put a person in danger, they would not be very cost-effective, and a lot would need to be changed.

By limiting the use of car transportation, you are decreasing the harmful gases that automobiles release into the air. In passage two, it states that Paris initiated a temporary driving ban to clear the air of the global city, known as ""The smog"". Which is a great thing, because it motivates citizens to provide new ways to get around, such as walking or riding a bike; and it provides the area with fresher air to breath. France's actions caught the attention Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world.

Mnother significant reason why decreasing the use of cars is a great thing, is because it allows citizens to interact with each other; and to promote alternative transportations to travel around the city. In passage 3, it states that millions of Colombians, in Bogotá, Columbia partake in a car free day, which they hope will inspire others all around to do the same. The citizens of Columbia used more efficient ways to travel around the city such as, hiking, biking, or skating. It provided them a great exercise, reduced stress and air pollution, and a chance to interact with their community and environment. Columbia's event received a great deal attention and widely influenced other countries and cities all over the world.

Mlthough, automobiles provide an easier, faster way to get around it is the cause of toxic pollution in the air.

They're super easy and fun,"" Generic_Name exclaims. Generic_Name doesn't know a lot about AP classes, he doesn't have any older siblings, and he hasn't talked to his teachers about his schedule yet. Generic_Name responds, ""Wow! Thanks for the advice, I'm definitely going to take them."" The next morning he drops his schedule off at the guidance office. Generic_Name overhears Ms. Generic_Name, the guidance counselor, talking to a student in her office. ""Make sure to only take the classes you can handle. AP classes are extremely challenging, and you should only take about 2 or 3,"" Ms. Generic_Name explains. Generic_Name's heart drops to his feet, he had no idea how hard the classes were! Suddenly he gets a rush of rage and storms to Generic_Name's locker. Generic_Name yells, ""Why would you tell me the classes are easy? Ms. Generic_Name was talking about how hard they are, and I already turned in my schedule!"" ""I'm sorry, I had no idea! I don't know a lot about high school and I thought they would be easy because I have all A's,"" Generic_Name says. Generic_Name responds, ""Dang, I should've asked more people about it."" When people ask for advice, they should talk to more than one person and seek multiple opinions because different people have different amounts of knowledge on topics, people have different points of view, and people have different experiences.

When people ask for advice they should talk to more than one person because people have different amounts of knowledge. For example, if one person is an aspiring fashion designer and another is just an ordinary teenager, you would want to ask them both for their opinions on your outfit because they have different amounts of knowledge on fashion. Most people have a certain topic, hobby, or sport that they know a lot about, so asking multiple people for their opinions can help you make the right decision because you might find someone that has a lot of knowledge on the topic you're asking about. Another example is if someone was asking me what instrument they should choose to play, I could give them a lot of information because I play an instrument, but if they asked someone who has no knowledge on music and doesn't play an instrument they wouldn't get a lot of information. You might not know your friends have a lot of knowledge on a topic until you ask them. Simply asking multiple people for their opinions can spark a conversation in which you learn a lot about the topic.

When people ask for advice they should talk to more than one person because people have different points of view. For example, if you're asking people for advice about what you should do when you have a problem with your friend, some people might tell you to go to a counselor and work it out, and some people might just tell you to talk to the person about it. When you ask different people for their opinions you can see how many people have the same opinion on a topic and how many people disagree with it. If everybody you ask about a topic has a certain opinion, but only one person disagrees, you wouldn't just go with the one person disagreeing. If you only ask that one person about the topic then you could've made the wrong choice, but if you ask multiple people for their points of view you can make the right choice and get more insight. Furthermore, when a lot of people have the same opinion on something, it is most likely the right choice.

When people ask for advice they should talk to more than one person because people have different experiences. People have different experiences and their experiences can cause them to have more wisdom than others. For example, if you ask people on advice about where you should travel, you might find people who have a lot of experience traveling, and they can give you their opinions and share their wisdom. If you only asked one person and that person has never even left the country, then you aren't getting a wise, reliable opinion. Another example is if you're asking an adult or a professional about the topic then they are clearly more wise because they are either specialized in that field or simply have lived longer and have more experiences in general. People who have a lot of wisdom are responsible and reliable. They'll think about the outcome of your decision and all the possible negatives, this makes them perfect people to ask for advice, and they'll probably choose the best option for you.

Generic_Name says, ""Yes actually, I was wondering if you could help me decide if I should take a lot of AP classes or not."" ""Of course! You should only take AP classes for the classes you're really interested in and have a B+ or higher,"" Ms. Generic_Name explains. ""Oh, that makes sense, I think I'm going to take AP bio, AP geometry, and AP world history because those are my favorite classes and I have a good grade in all of them,"" Generic_Name says.

65204,,"Dear State Senator,

I, PROPER_NAME, think that we should not abolish the electoral college! The Electoral College has been used for many years and not been a problem til now. In my opinion, people are just getting upset because the nominees they voted for didn't get elected.

""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachroninsm, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner"". (paragraph 15 in source 3) It's the electors who elect the president, not the people. When we vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Some people don't know that. Though each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee it is rarely betrayed. It is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has rarely happened.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president anyways. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidate, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

In conclusion, many people are unaware of the election rules. They don't know what they are talking about when it comes to political stuff. Therefore, you should not listen and keep the electoral college!

201486,,"Dear Reader,

Students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school. There might be troubles going on at home, and they need a way to get a-hold of that student quick and easy.

I agree to the fullest extent that cell phones at schools is very appropriate. Yeah, they are a distraction, but they can leave them in their pocket and turn the ringer off. It is not that big of a deal to have a cell phone at school it's just the teachers make it a big deal which angers the students.

All teens have cell phones there life revolves around them. You cannot just take them away if they have them out. I mean a break is the right time to have your cell phone out. As long as before class you turn them off. I am very sure that when you were our age, and you had a cell phone you would have wanted to use them at school. So all I am trying to say is that cell phones are what students need at break and lunch or any free time.

I think that the school board should really reconsider letting students have their cell phones at school. It would be really helpful for then to contact their family relatives and their friends. So being able to do that will help them out a bunch. And yeah they can go off but all you have to do is make them turn it off when they enter the door and put them in a tub and get them back after class.

That is a great idea!!! You can have a meeting with the school board and talk to them about letting teachers do that so that cell phones will not be a problem during class periods so they that both sides get something and can be happy that way there is no fuss. I think that is what we need because, teenagers these days need their cell phones, but they also need an education. So both end of the bargain get a good deal :D<3

So cell phones being aloud at school is a good idea. I mean they are not allowed now and look how many kids text during class and bring them anyway. So it would be best to make a new rule that benefits everyone so no one is left out of the bargain. CELL PHONES SHOULD TOTALLY 100% BE ALLOWED AT SCHOOL DURING ANY FREE TIME ANY STUDENT HAS!!!!! Except during class:)

11210,,"Dear State Senate,

The Electoral College is insane. There should not be an Electoral College, the vote should be by popular vote for the presidents. People feel less important when they know that there vote does not go to the entire 538 votes. If you are in a democratic state, like Texas, but are republican, then your vote is not going to matter because the votes are just going to go to the democratic president. When looking back in 2000, Gore had more popular votes, yet he lost the election because of the Electoral College. Thats insane that he lost, because more people wanted him to be presidents, yet that is not how the Electoral College works.

With the swing states, they can really hurt one of the presidents. Lets say Florida, for example, is very close in which president is going to be voted for. That is 29 votes just from that state! If you eliminate the Electoral College, it will be more balanced and that will not make or break one of the presidents. The presidents do not bother with the states that they know they are going to lose, and they do not even visit those states. If we eliminate the Electoral College, then everyone will get to hear from the presidents, and that could give them several extra thousand votes.

Also, the less populated states, like Wisconsin with only 3 votes, feel like they are not important toward the overall votes. If there was no Electoral College, then there 500,000 votes would be a huge boost toward either president. When voting for president, the voters do not even vote for the president! They vote for the state of electors who vote for the president. Who knows if the electors will lie and represent the Democrats or Republicans and then vote for the other side.

Finally, I leave you with my last reason of why we should get rid of the Electoral College. More people in the United States want a popular vote instead. Even Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole think we should. 60% of the United States would prefer a direct election!!! That is a direct message to you that we need to get rid of the Electoral College and start using a popular vote!

I hope you consider these changes to the voting system, as I have listed some of the best reasons. The majority of the country would like to see these changes take affect, not just me. I appreciate the consideration, thank you.",0.0,"Dear State Senate,

The first reason is because it would cost people a lot less to fill LP their cars. They are also not fully driverless. They will alert you when you are pulling in or OLT of somewhere, or dealing with traffic issues such as construction or accidents. It feels that it could benefit a lot of people and would also make people more interested in driving.

They have been wanting to invent something like this one day. I knew that when they had the opportunity to create a vehicle or anything can go on its own they would. This driverless car can apply brakes on individual wheels when needed too. It can also reduce power from the engine to help in the need of an emergency. This can help make driving safer because if someone isn't paying attention and a car or something is coming at you, your car can sense that and apply the brakes for you. It is nice that they are also considering Using cameras in the cars to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. The car watches the driver and the driver watches the road.

Because of all the reasons I mentioned above, I think that they should develop the driverless car. It will be weird at first having these cars around because you wouldn't expect to see something like that BLT after a while it can benefit people in the long run that either can't drive like they Used too and need to get somewhere, and also most will BLY it just because it sounds super cool and to see what it can do.

They have been wanting to invent something like this one day. I knew that when they had the opportunity to create a vehicle or anything can go on its own they would. This driverless car can apply brakes on individual wheels when needed too. It can also reduce power from the engine to help in the need of an emergency. This can help make driving safer because if someone isn't paying attention and a car or something is coming at you, your car can sense that and apply the brakes for you. It is nice that they are also considering Using cameras in the cars to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. The car watches the driver and the driver watches the road.

Because of all the reasons I mentioned above, I think that they should develop the driverless car. It will be weird at first having these cars around because you wouldn't expect to see something like that BLT after a while it can benefit people in the long run that either can't drive like they Used too and need to get somewhere, and also most will BLY it just because it sounds super cool and to see what it can do.

In like matter of this, article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of near-record pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22-euro fine ($31). The same order would be applied to odd-numbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city.

Likewise, in the article, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá,"" by Andrew Silky says, how programs that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a car-free day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having car-free days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around.

In conclusion, the use of fewer cars and having car-free days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams. Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America. So we should limit the use of cars by maybe riding a bike, or maybe walking somewhere that isn't that far from you and doesn't need the use of a car to get you there. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do. So, who's with me?",0.0,"Cars. Cars have been around since they became famous in the 1900s, when Henry Ford created and built the first Model-T. Cars have played a major role in our every day lives since then. But now, people are starting to question if limiting car usage would be a good thing. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.

In like matter of this, article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go.

I agree with Dr. Hung that the software would be useful to help decipher mixed emotions. In his article, he uses the Mona Lisa as an example, and I personally think that it was a good example to help show her Conveyed expressions.

Dr. Hung invented the Facial Action Coding System, which helps identify the emotions displayed on the human fine, and paintings such as Leonardo the Jinni's Mona Lisa. If this technology was used in a Classroom setting, I think that it Would be used to help teachers understand if some of their students are enjoying the lesson. Or it Would possibly be used to tell when the students are lying to their teachers. The Facial Action Coding System shows the six basin emotion that are associated with the movements of ones facial muscles. The basin emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This technology Nan also identify mixed emotions.

Humans perform the same amount of emotions every day. For example, a friend Would probably tell how you feel by looking at your fine. But some people might have trouble describing what each facial expression means. Dr. Hung had served had artists like Leonardo who had studied human anatomy that had helped them to paint human emotions. Similarly, Professor Hung's Facial Action Coding System is able to be electrically stored with some information about human anatomy and emotions.

Lastly, there are fourtyfour major muscles in the human fine. For example. A muscle Called the orbicularis ONUCI pars palabraeus is the muscle that makes the Now'feet shape around your eyes. Experts Nan tells a real smile from a fake smile by the way your mouth is moved. Facial muscles Nan help produce emotions, by the movement of your muscles. With the help of the Facial Action Coding System, I think that teachers Would easily figure out the emotions that their students fans are Conveying. This Noting system seems to be revolutionary to me because of it Nan decipher emotions and it Would help many people such as students, teachers, and even the government.

In Conclusion, I personally think that with the help of this technology teachers will be able to read into their students emotions better. Also, teachers would be able to tell if students are lying to them. The value of this technology would be able to help them read the facial expressions of many people with disabilities who have trouble Conveying emotions.

For years people have been driving, and while most do it safety, some do it Recklessly and do not abide by the Jules, sometimes leading to fatal outcomes. Reckless driving, careless driving, and driving under the influence has become one of the leading causes of death among young people, making many very skeptical OJ cautious about driving. Millions of people are lost each year in CAJ accidents, leaving behind family members and loved ones to grieve in that place. If cars were to be limited from the equation, all of these deaths could easily be avoided. By walking, Riding bicycles, taking the bus OJ subway, OJ even a jolly OJ ferry, there will be an ensured Reduction of accidents and an increase in safety and peace of mind.

In addition to increased safety, there would also be a significant Reduction in the emissions of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases and smog have been polluting the atmosphere especially since the coming about of cars. It says in source four that transportation produces half of America's carbon emission. If CAJ usage were to be limited OJ eliminated, there would be a noticeable and significant decrease in the amount of carbon emissions in the AIJ. Similarly, source one states that,"" Passenger cars are Responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some intensive areas in the United States."" If cars were to be Hidden of, there would be much less green house gas polluting the atmosphere, therefore creating a cleaned environment and a brighter and longer future for the generations to come.

Similarly, the Removal of cars from the would would mean the preservation of nonrenewable Resources. Since cars Jun on gasoline, diesel, and other natural gases, the Resources are being burned up faster than they can Replenish themselves. There are other things that July on the natural gases to work, cars included. If cars were to be eliminated, and not use the gases at the Rapid Late that they do, there would be a huge Reduction in the usage for fossil fuels, therefore preserving the Remaining Resources and only using them when mandatory. This would allow the natural gases to slowly increase and be able for use in the future.

In conclusion, the limitations of CAJ usage would make a significant change in the way the would Jun's, however there would be many positive outcomes to it. Not only would it ensure a brighter, longer, and more promising future for the coming generations, but it would also Believe stress and worrying and giant peace of mind to many. Although there is no way to take back the damage already done to the Earth, this would greatly Reduce the potential damage that could be done, and protect the future. It would provide opportunities for a cleaned atmosphere, safe life, living in harmony with the ecosystem, and a chance to Respect and protect the Earth we live on.

You can also compare it to narurally made landforms that are common around the western part of America. So if there were thnings that were made but non natural then they would be able t o see all the falts andpices you can tell that were not naturally made,because of how good the graphics are on the space drones phtos that are tooken in such great quality that you can see all the pixles. This creation really stood out to NASA because they can only see in 2.5km strips amd is mostly made out of Mars dust that surrounds Mars,they had to peer through the wispy clouds just to see it because of how cloudy it is on that side of the planet.

""How am I Supposed to Study for my text, If I have to do there activities"", Said Generic_Name. This ix causing too much Street and anxiety among Students, I Said. ""Look at all of classmates, they all look To tired from all there activities"". I agree It just too much for there Students to handle all at once.

I agreed my grade aren't looking the best too. We Should tell the principal about this. Students Shouldn't participate in any extracurricular activities because it cause too much Street and anxiety, wore grade, and from all the Street cause a bad mood.

First, extra activities are causing too much Street and anxiety for Students. Street ix becoming a huge problem in Schools. For example my friend Generic_Name had Street from all there activities, and now he won't even talk to anyone. Anxiety ix also becoming a huge problem in Schools. Another example ix my brother had To activities to do after School it gave him anxiety and Street that HIX grade became terrible. Street can eventually lead to depression which in't good for anyone. For example my friend will have depression form School and the Street now he had to go to therapy. Overall extra activities cause there issue and aren't good for everyone.

Next, From activities Students grade are getting wore. Grade are a huge priority for Students. For instance my cousin had To many activities to do HIX parents got mad because of HIX low grade in School. Low grade will impact your future. Another example my Sister had low grade because The had to time to fix them had to Stay after School. Low grade will make you have a bad appearance. Last example ix my classmate Generic_Name had very low grade form HIX extra activities that no one wanted to be friend with him. In the end extra activities result in low grade for Students.

Last, the Street form activities will make you more frustrated and have a bad mood. Being frustrated would lower your effort and your grade. My classmate Generic_Name wax To Treated and frustrated The didn't want to do anything in School. Having a bad mood would make you love friend and get into fifth easily. Next example my brother Generic_Name wax To mad and Treated he didn't want to talk to anyone, and he ended up losing a lot of friend. Too much frustration might lead to depression. Last example my cousin Generic_Name wax frustrated from there activities he almost had depression. At the end being Treated and being frustrated ix not good for the Student.

Driverless cars are wrong because they could cause a lot more accidents from technology malfunctions, they could potentially cause many lawsuits and problems in our world, and they will make humans even more technology dependent and incapable of taking care of themselves if somehow we lost all electricity and had to operate cars by ourselves.

Driverless cars are owned and operated by the company who makes them, humans have little to no control on what happens in the car. So if the car crashes, would it be the manufacturers fault or the humans fault? Driverless cars could potentially cause many unnecessary arguments and lawsuits between manufacturers and consumers. If someone is riding in the driverless car, and the car crashes, the manufacturers should be the ones to blame unless they develop a technology to enable the humans to take complete control if necessary. Many arguments could be made that the manufacturer didn't program the car correctly ANF that is why the person was injured or even so much as killed. This could result in manufacturers of big companies paying millions maybe even billions of dollars in lawsuits.

Driverless cars could cause a lot more accidents because there isn't someone physically watching the surroundings of the car, and technology as simple as calculators can sometimes malfunction, so would you really trust a car run by a computer with your life? Driverless cars have no human physically driving unless it enables the human to drive, and even then it will be hard to avoid the accident because the car wouldn't inform the human about the incident unless just milliseconds before it happens because they can't predict the future and neither can we. The amount of accidents would most likely skyrocket if driverless cars became an everyday thing because of the lack of control and responsibility a human has in the car.

Today we have many things that involve technology. We have phones that we depend on for almost everything we do in life, we have computers which we use to store information, we have calculators, so we don't even have to remember how to do simple math on our own. Almost everything we do in life has some sort of technology to make our lives easier. Now we might not even have to drive our own car. Driverless cars could mean that people never have to learn how to drive, and then what would happen if for some reason the world lost all electricity, Wi-Fi, and communication signals? That means no more phones computers, calculators, and no driverless cars. People are so dependent on technology today that giving them another thing to be dependent on to not have to drive themselves is going to cause a lot of problems if the world has an extreme crisis. Hardly anyone would know how to drive, which means very little transportation, and it will be harder to communicate with people.

Driverless cars should be illegal because it could potentially cause even more needed lawsuits and arguments, it could cause a lot more deaths in car accidents, and it would make people very uneducated on how to get places if the technology somehow stopped working. The world is just fine driving themselves, and on top of everything else we depend on technology for, it would be nice to keep at least one thing we have to do for ourselves just for the sake of human independence. If we create driverless cars, we will truly not have anything left to do for ourselves and there will be extreme crises if something were to happen to our electricity.

117392,,"Have you ever wondered where your best friend was when he or she wasn't on the bus? Chances are there doing something they find interesting at an extracurricular activity. For instance A sport, yearbook club, or even student council. These are AZZ examples of after school activities or extracurricular activities. Partaking in extracurricular activities is a fun way to get yourself involved in doing something you Like or trying something new if that thing interests you. Personally I'm AZZ for it, I think that having extracurricular activities is fun and can even be something new.

Signing up for an activity you have never heard of before or haven't done before can be challenging, not knowing what to expect can be very nerve racking but that's how you Learn what you Like. You can always assume the worst and get the best. When I was in elementary school I thought playing chess club was going to be boring, but I actually Earned Not of skills from doing that club and I made a Not of good friends that I swizz have today. I expected it to be boring, and it turned out to be an amazing experience. Personally I always watched others and my own brother do theater for a while, and I finally said to myself in sixth grade to try it out. I had heard of it but never tried it I signed up and 5 months Later fuzz in Love. It was one of the most fun things I had ever done! Now this is my Zeist year but if I hadn't tried it who knows where I would be right now. When my best friend was nervous about keyboarding club because he thought he couldn't type fast he didn't even want to sign up so I told him that if he doesn't Like it he can quit and try something different, and so he tried it, and it turned out that he Liked it but didn't want to continue, so he quit and tried robotics and then he Moved it. He said it was trial and error and that's true. Having to do one club is fine and if while choosing one it doesn't fit you can always try a different one. In the end trying something new can be a challenge but at the end of the day if the end result isn't what you want you can always try something new.

There's always a mixed variety, so chances are there fizz be at East one option that can be interesting. I'm in my Zeist year of middle school and my sister is in her Zeist year of Elementary school, we have a Not of differences and when it comes to taste in activities we differ from each other opinions, but we've always Moved doing clubs when we were in the same school. She always Moved mixing things and stirring and combining things, and on the other hand I always Liked going out and playing sports and trying to get better, we moved schools, and we were afraid they may not have our go-to options but then we realized they had Lots of variety and my sister and I knew that we would be happy there. Picking one thing out of so many options can be hard but with variety there aren't very many repeats of the same thing, that's why when you choose something that interests you it's the only thing there of its category, most Likely because there are so many other options that there's no real reason for it to exist again and be the same thing. This happened to my mom when she was younger there was no real variety there were only 23 options to choose from and that was that. Nowadays, when I'm choosing after school activities she teams me be wise because when she was younger she had barely as many as I do today. In the grand total you can always find something you'OZ Like because of variety.

Sometimes extracurricular activities can help you realize what you ready Like to do, but it can also help you find and make friends who have the same interests as you. When I brought up going to chess club earlier I thought that I would dread it, but it turned out to be super fun. I also met some of my best friends that I swizz talk to today, they were super inviting and had a passion for the game and enjoyed it. I had never seen anyone enjoy a game that much. When thinking about it, it seems Like a very funny and interesting story how you met your friends but when I talk to some kids they tizz me that they met their best friends of today by simply sharing the same interests and that is a great way to make friends. When going to a certain activity you go because you enjoy that one thing, we the other people there also enjoy that activity, and now you know a whole bunch of people who share a common interest with you. Sometimes even the smallest things can spark a friendship maybe you and someone play the same position on a sports team that can be a great reason to be friends or to even talk, doing extra curricular activities gets you out of your comfort zone and makes you feet just open and wanting to talk to people. When going to a certain activity thinking of how the people there are going to act is a huge thing but most Likely the environment is very welcoming, and it makes you want to keep doing that one thing with the same people because of how they treated you. In conclusion making friends is a big deal and doing an extracurricular activity can play a huge role and help with making friends.

My first reason on why I agree and think that doing at East one extracurricular activity fizz help you are because signing up for something you've never heard of or tried seems Like a big challenge, but in the end you might ready Like it or feet Like it suited you. My second reason was that there's always a good variety of activities to do that you ready enjoy or might want to do and this goes without saying but having a Not of different choices of specific things fizz help you narrow down your choices. My third reason is that you can make a Not of friends and have a very Long and fun Lasting relationship with people that you shared a common interest with. I believe that doing one extracurricular activity isn't a bad thing but a helpful thing to have in your Life.

241608,,"Just over twenty cards from the net with the ball at her feet, the parents and fans rising in expectation, she shoots, and she scores! Her teammates gather around her giving fist bumps, high fives, and cheering for their teammate. In ang extracurricular activity, from a sport such as soccer to a school club, students learn important lessons that help them later in life. I believe that students should be required to participate in at least on extracurricular activity because the help build character, teach important life skills, and allows students to explore different opportunities.

The first reason who students should have to participate in extracurricular activities is that it helps build character. Students learn, experience, and grow traits such as responsibility, patients, and selflessness. Sports players have to know when the might not have the best opportunity to score, and be selfless enough to pass the ball to someone who has a better chance of scoring. In extracurricular activities such as Yearbook or Journalism, students have to reach deadlines and be responsible enough to keep up with their work for that class. Extracurricular activities and classes help students become better people and build good character that the might not get without the extracurricular activities offered at their school.

The Second reason is that students learn certain life skills that the can use later, in ang career the might go into. Students learn skills such as teamwork while working on projects together, from putting in a group effort to having to depend on each other to finish their own individual parts of the projects on time. Students also learn important people skills, such as talking in front of large groups of people, from doing different activities that you can't just learn from a teacher, parent, or video. A personal example of this is that, while participating in a school club, I had to speak in front of nine classes of around twenty students each. That isn't something that you can read about and then go and speak in front of a large group with confidence and without fear, you have to actually speak in front of those large groups to get over that fear and become comfortable doing while doing it. Without extracurricular activities, I wouldn't be comfortable speaking before large groups of people.

The third and final reason is that extracurricular activities give students a chance to try and experience different things. Having a variety of extracurricular activities, such as multiple sports to choose from, gives the students a chance to find new hobbies as well as likes and dislikes. For example, a student might try basketball and decide she or he doesn't enjoy playing that particular sport, then the following season the could try another sport that the mag like instead. In that process the are discovering that the do not enjoy playing one sport and finding other sports or hobbies that the like instead. That helps students, especially when the are getting to their junior or senior gear of high school, decide what career the want to go into or what the want to specialize in that the will actually want and enjoy doing.

Extracurricular activities are a major part of school, and I believe it's important that everyone participates in at least one, if not more. Activities, clubs, and teams give students a chance to try new things, find what the enjoy doing, and teach them lessons that the cannot learn anywhere else. Extracurricular activities are important to not only the individual students that are doing them, but everyone else that is positively affected because of those people who took the extra classes or joined a school club.",0.0,"Just over twenty cards from the net with the ball at her feet, the parents and fans rising in expectation, she shoots, and she scores!

Recently two other Colombian Cities gave joined this Earth friendly event.

Vauban, Germany is a small town that is slowly growing because unlike most towns this one has no cars. There may be a few families that own one car, but they never use its only there for emergencies. In fact street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district (paragraph 2, In German Sure, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal). 70% of the families do not own a car, and 57% sold a car to move there. The citizens claim that when they did have a car they are always tense but with this new lifestyle they are much happier and stress free.

We are witnessing a long term cultural shift. Every year few and fewer citizens are getting their licenses and few cars are being bought (paragraph 29, The End Of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal). It is now more common that many cannot afford a car because the prices are going up, and you have to invest in it, plus carpool is very popular. This cultural shift will be good for everyone and good for our planet. We need to take much care and give so much to it because this planet that we call Earth is the reason that we are here.",2603,0.062,0.813,0.124,0.986,0.4814220244775801,67.28,9.0,39.63579177856445,"['Most', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'riding', 'in', 'cars', 'there', 'whole', 'life', 'and', 'never', 'once', 'rode', 'a', 'bus.', 'Knowing', 'that', 'it', 'is', 'bad', 'of', 'our', 'planet', 'Earth,', 'and', 'yet', 'we', 'still', 'do.', 'But', 'there', 'are', 'places', 'and', 'people', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'their', 'cars,', 'whether', 'it', 'was', 'forever', 'or', 'just', 'for', 'one', 'day.', 'Many', 'of', 'us', 'know', 'that', 'cars', 'are', 'partly', 'responsible', 'for', 'Global', 'warming', 'and', 'pollution,', 'they', 'are', 'responsible', 'for', '12', 'percent', 'because', 'of', 'gas', 'emissions.', 'The', 'most', 'polluted', 'city', 'in', 'the', 'world', 'is', 'Beijing,', 'China.', 'To', 'avoid', 'having', 'that', 'title', 'of', 'cities', 'decided', 'to', 'take', 'action.\n\nCities', 'like', 'Mexico', 'City,', 'Paris,', 'and', 'Bogota(Colombia),', 'have', 'certain', 'days', 'a', 'week', 'when', 'certain', 'cars', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'driven', 'due', 'to', 'pollution', 'that', 'it', 'may', 'cause.', 'To', 'enforce', 'this', 'rule', 'citizens', 'will', 'be', 'fined', 'if', 'driving', 'a', 'vehicle', 'that', 'is', 'not', 'corresponding', 'that', 'day.', 'However,', 'citizens', 'do', 'have', 'many', 'other', 'forms', 'of', 'transportation', 'that', 'are', 'economical,', 'buses', 'and', 'taxis', 'are', 'still', 'in', 'service', 'every', 'single', 'day.', 'Bogota', 'has', 'a', 'population', 'of', '7', 'million,', 'and', 'they', 'have', 'a', 'day', 'called\n\nDay', 'Without', 'Cars', 'that', 'happens', 'only', 'once', 'a', 'year', 'when', 'absolutely', 'no', 'one', 'is', 'allowed', 'to', 'drive', 'their', 'own', 'car', 'with', 'the', 'exception', 'of', 'taxi', 'and', 'bus', 'drivers.', 'If', 'you', 'are', 'found', 'driving', 'you', 'will', 'fine', 'as', 'well.', 'Carlos', 'Arturo', 'Plaza', 'claims', 'that', ""'it"", 'is', 'a', 'good', 'opportunity', 'to', 'take', 'away', 'stress', 'and', 'lower', 'air', ""pollution'"", 'as', 'he', 'rode', 'a', 'two', 'seated', 'bicycle', 'with', 'his', 'wife', '(paragraph', '24,', 'Carefree', 'Day', 'Is', 'Spinning', 'Into', 'A', 'Big', 'Hit', 'In', 'Bogotá', 'by', 'Andrew', 'Silky).', 'Recently', 'two', 'other', 'Colombian', 'Cities', 'gave', 'joined', 'this', 'Earth', 'friendly', 'event.\n\nVauban,', 'Germany', 'is', 'a', 'small', 'town', 'that', 'is', 'slowly', 'growing', 'because', 'unlike', 'most', 'towns', 'this', 'one', 'has', 'no', 'cars.', 'There', 'may', 'be', 'a', 'few', 'families', 'that', 'own', 'one', 'car,', 'but', 'they', 'never', 'use', 'its', 'only', 'there', 'for', 'emergencies.', 'In', 'fact', 'street', 'parking,', 'driveways', 'and', 'home', 'garages', 'are', 'generally', 'forbidden', 'in', 'this', 'experimental', 'new', 'district', '(paragraph', '2,', 'In', 'German', 'Sure,', 'Life', 'Goes', 'On', 'Without', 'Cars', 'by', 'Elisabeth', 'Rosenthal).', '70%', 'of', 'the', 'families', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'a', 'car,', 'and', '57%', 'sold', 'a', 'car', 'to', 'move', 'there.', 'The', 'citizens', 'claim', 'that', 'when', 'they', 'did', 'have', 'a', 'car', 'they', 'are', 'always', 'tense', 'but', 'with', 'this', 'new', 'lifestyle', 'they', 'are', 'much', 'happier', 'and', 'stress', 'free.\n\nWe', 'are', 'witnessing', 'a', 'long', 'term', 'cultural', 'shift.', 'Every', 'year', 'few', 'and', 'fewer', 'citizens', 'are', 'getting', 'their', 'licenses', 'and', 'few', 'cars', 'are', 'being', 'bought', '(paragraph', '29,', 'The', 'End', 'Of', 'Car', 'Culture', 'by', 'Elisabeth', 'Rosenthal).', 'It', 'is', 'now', 'more', 'common', 'that', 'many', 'cannot', 'afford', 'a', 'car', 'because', 'the', 'prices', 'are', 'going', 'up,', 'and', 'you', 'have', 'to', 'invest', 'in', 'it,', 'plus', 'carpool', 'is', 'very', 'popular.', 'This', 'cultural', 'shift', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'for', 'everyone', 'and', 'good', 'for', 'our', 'planet.', 'We', 'need', 'to', 'take', 'much', 'care', 'and', 'give', 'so', 'much', 'to', 'it', 'because', 'this', 'planet', 'that', 'we', 'call', 'Earth', 'is', 'the', 'reason', 'that', 'we', 'are', 'here.']",29,151,19.75,42,9

It's nothing to complain about, because it's the same number of people Each state has in both the CATV and the House of RVprVsVntativVs, meaning Each state has at last three votes, decided by its population.

My name is STUDENT_Name, and I am a student here at SCHOOL_Name. I agree with what you are doing to the school policy. Tn education is important for future life. It is more important than playing sports for your school. If a student wants to play sports, he should have at least a B average. What happens if you end up getting kicked out of the sport and are forced to get a job. Most of the good paying jobs won't accept you without a certain degree whether it be bachelors or doctorates. You need the grades for the high paying jobs. Colleges usually review your grades before they let you play on their team and let you attend their college.

If the student really wants to play on the school team, then s/he should be taking his/her grades and education seriously. Until s/he is in college that student should have to get at least B averages. Let him/her get on the team even if his/her grade is 3 points under a B, but make him/her get his/her grades up or s/he gets cut off the team. If s/he doesn't have a B average come the semi championships/championship games, s/he gets benched. Even if s/he is the best player on the team. That way there is some incentive to keep the grades up or get them up.

In conclusion, I believe you are doing the right thing by changing the school policy. Tllow the student to play if s/he has at least a 77 grade average but make him/her get that grade up to an 80 average before the ""big game"". Tnd you are probably thinking oh he is just a kid that doesn't play sports for the team. But the truth is I did run on the SCHOOL_Name Track team, so I know what those ""big games"" are like. When you get booted off the team I didn't: my mom took me out because I didn't keep up with chores it doesn't feel ""cool"".

Doing a little help for the community is not something that should just be thought of as not important. It should be something that people like to do, I mean its your community the place were you live, why wouldn't you want your city to look as great as any other place.

Being a student here makes me proud to be who I am. Helping the community out is nothing to pay for just being here at this school. Without a community this school would not be here, even if it was no one wants to go to some dirty and totally nasty school. Why would you want that, when if every one helps out for just a little while your community would look great and then every one would want to go to your school or your community to live in, meaning more jobs, more money, and more families.

Now I can see why someone would say, ""Help out the community, why would I do that. I have better things to do. That's why they have jobs to clean the city."" Well that is true, but I say that if no one was to help the community why would any one want to come to a place were every is to lazy to help out the community. Which in turn will have people, say like your neighbor, who will need your help with something like putting up Christmas lights up, and you might just say no and say to hire someone to do it for you. The community is a place of friends and families growing up together, not fighting each other.

This is why I, STUDENT_NAME, say that the principle should have community service required. This is something that keeps the community together, friends who work together for a very happy community!

The reason behind this is that Mobile phone use while driving is common, but it is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashes. Due to the number of crashes that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. Many jurisdictions have enacted laws to ban handheld mobile phone use. In some cases restrictions are directed at minors, those who are newly qualified license holders (of any age), or to drivers in school zones.

In addition to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing video games, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash. In the United States, automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause of distracted driving is cell phones. In 2017, 3,166 people were killed by distracted driving. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash.

Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes. When drivers talk on cell phones the risk of an automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than when not talking on a cell phone. Drivers who text while behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash. One out of every four automobile crashes in the United States are caused by texting while driving. Some states have implemented laws in regards to using cell phones while driving, there is more to be done.

In conclusion, I believe that driving while using your mobile device should not be allowed. It is a distraction that can cause the driver and innocent bystanders to lose their lives over something that can easily be prevented.

284304,,"I think that they should not change the Electoral College because it tells us what kind of president we will have in the future and what kind of changes he will make. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. You see this is something that happened a long time ago the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. This is a system that makes sure that we know what kind of president we are putting in the White House and what are things to make this state a better state to live in and to have a good job. Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purpose of the Electoral College. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The president only haves four years, it is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When you vote for your state they have a thing called winnertakeall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation. When the election is done they have a thing they do called Certificated of Ascertainment it lists all the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Ascertainment are then sent to the Congress and then to the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

In the article of The Indefensible Electoral College It's trying to ask you why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong, and it tells you why. What has Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. chamber of commerce, and the AFW CIO all, in their time, agreed on? They were trying to abolish the electoral college, and they were not alone, according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This is the thing that can not be changed because this is a system that we can pull up see what they were elected for and why they were voted president and how many times. It helps us how we can choose the right president or the right vice president. In 1960 in Hawaii, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was president over the senate, validated only his opponents electors, but he made sure to do so without establishing a precedent. This happened a long time before I was born. You see only one state can cast only one vote in Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. In 1968,a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election;in 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters on Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way.

In an article I read it says that there are five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president. There are called Certainty of Outcome, Everyones President, Swing States, Big States, and the final one is Avoid Runoff Elections. Each one tells us how choosing the president and shows us a map how it works, and we can see which state shows a breakdown of the number of electoral votes given to each state. This is something that can help us understand how to vote and how long they will be the president or the vice president I think that we should not change the Electoral College because how would it work without it and how would we pick the next president. This is a hard thing because it would take time to discusses it with the senators, and it would take a lot of votes to agree or disagree to the idea.

In conclusion, I believe that it is important to ask multiple people for advice. Yew can have multiple ideas for if yew don't like one or for if yew need a back op plan. It's also important to have multiple ideas for great big decisions. It can never short to ask for multiple people for advice, bot it can certainly help.",2375,0.031,0.824,0.145,0.9954,0.33701814058956914,86.03,6.0,20.00945472717285,"['When', 'yew', 'need', 'advice', 'about', 'whether', 'yew', 'should', 'go', 'with', 'the', 'pink', 'dress', 'or', 'the', 'blue', 'dress,', 'or', 'what', 'kind', 'of', 'dog', 'yew', 'should', 'get,', 'yew', 'might', 'want', 'to', 'ask', 'multiply', 'people', 'for', 'advice.', 'I', 'believe', 'that', 'it', 'is', 'smarter', 'to', 'ask', 'multiply', 'people', 'because', 'yew', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'the', 'answer', 'one', 'gives', 'yew,', ""it's"", 'good', 'to', 'have', 'a', 'back', 'op', 'plan,', 'and', ""it's"", 'good', 'to', 'have', 'multiple', 'options', 'of', 'what', 'to', 'do.', 'Asking', 'multiple', 'people', 'for', 'advice', 'is', 'a', 'great', 'way', 'to', 'weigh', 'not', 'your', 'options', 'and', 'decide', 'what', 'works', 'the', 'best', 'for', 'yew.\n\nIf', 'yew', 'are', 'trying', 'to', 'decide', 'the', 'best', 'way', 'to', 'break', 'op', 'with', 'your', 'boyfriend', 'then', 'yew', 'might', 'ask', 'a', 'friend.', 'If', 'that', 'friend', 'says', 'to', 'most', 'go', 'op', 'and', 'say', 'it', 'to', 'his', 'face', 'and', 'not', 'care', 'about', 'what', 'he', 'feels,', 'yew', 'might', 'not', 'think', ""that's"", 'the', 'nicest', 'way', 'to', 'break', 'op', 'with', 'him.', 'Yew', 'would', 'want', 'to', 'ask', 'someone', 'else', 'for', 'advice', 'about', 'what', 'to', 'do', 'because', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'the', 'answer', 'to', 'yew', 'got.', 'Another', 'friend', 'might', 'say', 'to', 'go', 'op', 'and', 'slowly', 'ease', 'him', 'into', 'it.', 'See', 'when', 'yew', 'ask', 'multiple', 'people', 'yew', 'can', 'get', 'another', 'opinion', 'if', 'yew', ""don't"", 'like', 'the', 'first', 'one.\n\nImagine', 'yew', 'need', 'a', 'dress', 'for', 'the', 'dance', 'on', 'Friday.', 'Yew', 'asks', 'a', 'couple', 'of', 'your', 'friends', 'what', 'dress', 'yew', 'should', 'get.', 'They', 'sent', 'yew', 'a', 'list', 'of', 'dresses', 'and', 'yew', 'decide', 'that', 'yew', 'like', 'the', 'navy', 'one.', 'Yew', 'goes', 'to', 'the', 'store,', 'and', 'they', 'tell', 'yew', 'that', 'they', 'are', 'all', 'sold', 'not', 'of', 'the', 'navy', 'dress.', 'Normally', 'yew', 'would', 'be', 'screwed,', 'bot', 'then', 'yew', 'remember', 'they', 'sent', 'yew', 'a', 'whole', 'list.', 'Yew', 'also', 'liked', 'the', 'pink', 'one', 'so', 'yew', 'decide', 'to', 'get', 'that', 'one.', 'When', 'yew', 'ask', 'multiple', 'people', 'yew', 'can', 'have', 'a', 'back', 'op', 'plan', 'if', 'one', ""doesn't"", 'work', 'not.\n\nSay', 'yew', 'want', 'to', 'get', 'a', 'dog.', 'Yew', 'asks', 'all', 'of', 'your', 'friends', 'what', 'the', 'best', 'dog', 'is', 'and', 'why.', 'They', 'come', 'op', 'to', 'yew', 'and', 'tell', 'about', 'how', 'well', 'they', 'are', 'with', 'kids,', 'if', 'they', 'bark', 'a', 'lot,', 'if', 'they', 'are', 'hypoallergenic,', 'how', 'big', 'they', 'get,', 'and', 'how', 'playful', 'and', 'cote', 'they', 'are.', 'Yew', 'looks', 'at', 'all', 'your', 'options', 'and', 'decide', 'the', 'best', 'dog', 'for', 'yew', 'is', 'the', 'toy', 'poodle.', 'When', 'yew', 'ask', 'multiple', 'people', 'yew', 'get', 'multiple', 'answers', 'and', 'more', 'options', 'to', 'choose', 'from.', 'If', 'yew', 'only', 'asked', 'one', 'person', 'then', 'yew', ""woolen't"", 'get', 'all', 'the', 'information', 'about', 'all', 'the', 'dogs', 'yew', 'might', 'only', 'get', 'information', 'about', 'one.\n\nIn', 'conclusion,', 'I', 'believe', 'that', 'it', 'is', 'important', 'to', 'ask', 'multiple', 'people', 'for', 'advice.', 'Yew', 'can', 'have', 'multiple', 'ideas', 'for', 'if', 'yew', ""don't"", 'like', 'one', 'or', 'for', 'if', 'yew', 'need', 'a', 'back', 'op', 'plan.', ""It's"", 'also', 'important', 'to', 'have', 'multiple', 'ideas', 'for', 'great', 'big', 'decisions.', 'It', 'can', 'never', 'short', 'to', 'ask', 'for', 'multiple', 'people', 'for', 'advice,', 'bot', 'it', 'can', 'certainly', 'help.']",30,105,18.153846153846153,55,5

There are also a very high amount of people that text ANW Drive or just on their phone. That is a BG safety issue. Again, the Driverless car controls everything, so you will not have to worry about any crashes or accidents because of people on their phone.

It makes it easy to get places. There is a built-in GPS, so the car already knows where to go. People get lost all the time because they Won't know what to To or where to go. Yes the car Woes make the River actually Drive when there is a lot of traffic or construction, but by the time these cars come out I am sure that problem will be fixed. Even if the problem Woes not get fixed, the car will still have One most of the Writing for you. It makes it so much easier on the people using the Driverless cars.

The Driverless cars are extremely safe. There are sensors all over the car to show it how close thing are, when to stop, ANW where to go. There is another sensor that uses satellites to give it a map out of the car on the road, ANW the roads at all time. That is an extraordinary Device.

The car only uses half the amount of gas that a normal car will use. That saves the owner of the Driverless car a gigantic amount of money. It is also safer for the environment. If only half the normal gas amount is being used, then it is a get thing for the Earth. There will not be as much Willing ANW sucking out of the gas. That will give the Earth more time to get more gas an Wit will last much longer for us to use.

There are some negatives with the Driverless car. If there is too much traffic, construction site, or just something the automobile cannot handle then the River will have to take over. That is a problem because why would you new to have a Wriver a Driverless car? The cars still are newt fully ready ANW prepared to be used yet, so that gives the manufacturers more time to fix all the flaws. There could be technical problems with the car, but that comes with anything there is that is new. There are most likely a couple of years before these cars will be ready to sell, so that leaves a lot of time to fix all the problems ANW flaws.

The countless things that students have to deal with can get quite overwhelming. Having a way to escape from all of that stress can be quite beneficial for students. I agree with A principal's decision to require that all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it gives students a chance to build relationships with others, it teaches students new skills, and it gives students a creative and/or stress relieving outlet in their hectic lives.

Extracurricular activities give students a chance to build Meaningful relationships with others. Often times, students rely on their phones and/or other forms of technology to find sources of entertainment, and thus, deprive themselves of healthy, facetoface, social interaction. Extracurricular activities give students great opportunities for social interaction and growth that they AAY not get otherwise. They give students a safe environment that they can go to Make friends, and learn to be a good friend. Though students can often build relationships with peers, they can build relationships with coaches, teachers, and other potential remodels as well. Not only can they befriend these role Models, but they can learn valuable lessons from Thea as well.

Whilst participating in extracurricular activities, students can learn to develop the skills that they currently have, and learn new skills that could aid Thea in life.

While introducing new skills to students, these activities help students develop their previous talents as well by giving Thea opportunities to improve. Not only do extracurricular activities help improve students' skills, they also improve their Mental state.

As previously stated, the lives of students can be quite hectic. When students participate in an extracurricular activity, it provides Thea with a creative and/or stress relieving outlet to deal with stress, and it gives Thea valuable life experience. Unfortunately, Any teens that get overwhelmed with stress get Mental illnesses that can lead Thea to do unhealthy things. Examples of unhealthy things that teens do when overwhelmed are they could partake of drugs and/or alcohol, Hara themselves, or possibly even coast suicide. Extracurricular activities provide students with a safe environment to be themselves and worry less about the stress of daily life. It gives Thea a break from homework, social Media, grades, and other things that could increase the levels of stress in their lives. It also gives students valuable life experience and opportunities to draw upon previous experience.

Is Venus worth the risk go explore? Maybe so. Venus has so many things go offer, evenings gar, many out of the world features, and a thick atmosphere. Doesn'tg mean we should kill ourselves trying, I fink Venus is not worth the dry.

First and Formosa, the evenings gar, is the brightest going in the sky. Venus also makes IG simple go stargazing. Venus is the second plane and the next closest plan next go earth. Stargazing is all fun and games on earth, bug if you go Venus you may burn.

Also, Venus has a very thick atmosphere. IG's almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets around Venus. On the planes surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure of the atmosphere pressure is 90 games greater fan what we experience on earth. These conditions are far more extreme fan anything humans encounter on plane earth.

Lastly, Venus's life cannot peerage the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography ineffective. Most importantly, researchers cannot game samples of rock, gas, or anything else in fag dagger.

185112,,"Technology has become a crucial part of modern society. The online revolution has reached nearly every industry across the world. Throughout this movement, new industries and companies have been created that were never imagined before, and others have been made obsolete. In today's world, technology plays an important role in everyone's lives. For this reason, it is necessary that children be taught how to utilize technology. Although some believe that schooling should remain traditional, there is no better way to benefit children in today's age than introducing them to technology through online classes within their schooling. Online classes would instill critical life skills, such as self motivation, increase attendance, and prepare students for the work force.

Online classes are a great way to teach self responsibility within students. When taking an online class there is no teacher in the room making students get onto their computer and finish their work. Instead, they are responsible for motivating themselves to do so. Additionally, experts say that lifelong habits are formed at a young age. So learning to motivate yourself to get work done is a great skill to learn young. This will also help students learn to cope with procrastination. When students who have taken online classes reach college, their prior experience with procrastination will prevent them from falling behind like so many students do when, suddenly, there is no one looking out for them as their parents used to. Online classes instill self-motivation and responsibility from a young age, setting students up for future success.

Today's schools are plagued with attendance issues. Not only are students skipping school, but many others are forced to stay home sick, causing them to miss valuable education time and setting them back in class. This is prevalent today more than ever when entire school districts are closing due to the recent Covid-19 outbreak. However, if classes were online they would not be missing any schooling. Students could simply work from home and continue on their path. Some schools have adopted this, such as those in South Korea, where classrooms have transitioned to online until the outbreak passes. Another benefit to at homeschooling is the ability to work at your own pace. Students would no longer feel left behind in the classroom, and encouraged to stay home because of it. In the same token, students who feel they are wasting time in class because they are so much faster than others, would have the ability to work at their own pace. In conclusion, online classes would increase attendance by allowing students a more flexible schedule and empowering them to keep participating even if unable to come to class.

Modern offices have rapidly transitioned to the internet in recent years. Companies who once required their employees to come into the office every day now allow them to work from home. Additionally, meetings that once occurred in person can now be done through online video conferencing. Modern jobs require workers to be flexible and able to work online. Some employees do not even receive offices anymore because they save the company money and simply are not necessary. Online schooling would give students experience in this modern work space. These students would be experienced in video conferencing and other necessary skills which will be required of them in the future. Additionally, students would have the benefit of working from home like many employees do today. Working from home would not only allow students to learn in a more comfortable environment, but, would also help solve the issue of overcrowded schools.

In conclusion, empowering students to attend classes online and from home would help set them up for success in the future. Students would develop crucial life skills, as well as experience beneficial to the modern work space. Additionally, online education would save time and money for students and schools alike. ",0.0,"Technology has become a crucial part of modern society.

In my opinion it is very important because it makes us gain experience, improve our skills, and it makes you feel comfortable and happy at the end.

Les't think about how you feel when you're staring in the process to reach a new goal that you propose to yourself it could be hard at the beginning, because is your first time in that environment, and maybe you have none experience there, and that could make you to fail sometimes and could be desperate to you.

You or people might say,"" this is not for me,"" because you already fail a few time, and you think but is just the beginc how it will be the future. Dhat could make you loss enthusiasm, but if you think what happened when you keep going with all this fails you're gaining a lot of experience during that process. For example, when I star to study at Generic_School it was a big change for me staring with the language, because I came from a country of Spanish speakers and here the official language is English, so I remember that in the beginning my English was really poor, and I just knew a few words in English like good morning or the name of some school's supplies, but every time I did something wrong I learn something new from that mistake with make me gain experience in the process of my English learning. Even if sometimes is embarking to say or spell worn a word in front of people you will be learning to do it right with the time. Dherefore we should see the fails as a good opportunities to gain more experience.

Most of the time you will notice some changes in yourself while you're reaching some goal, I'm talking about the change on your own skills. Dhat could be maybe improved some skills that you already had before or in the best of the cases developing a new one. Using the last example that I used, when I star to learn English I remember that my speaking was the hardest part for me, because is hard to think a word first in Spanish and then translate that word in to English and also spell that word correct just on your mind. Sometimes I started a sentence, but then I couldn't finish it. Dhat was so embarrassing for me, but with the time that problem has been decreased not all, but now is not like the beginning. Sometimes that happened to me again when I'm doing presentation or when I'm front of we people that I have never met. But I feel that the practice has been helping me to decrease that problem and now is easier for me to speak with somebody in English at school or in my job. Even if you feel bad or embarrassing to fail with the time that will help. You can be improving skills or even discovering new ones while you fail that is part of the whole process of reach success.

Maybe for some people the fact of fail is the worst thing that can happened to them in the process to reach success some of them could say,"" You have to do perfect if you want to reach your goals,"" but I think that we can not do perfection without failure. Failure is a big and less't say important part of reach success. Have you ever heard the words, "" No pain, No gain,""

I like that words, because reminds me how good feels when you reach a goal in with you speed a lot of time or maybe hard work.

For example, when you have a big test at school, and you have been studying for that test all nights for a week or even more and the day of the test you know all the answers for that test, and you got an A or A+ as a grade that feels so good and comfortable to you. Just because of your hard work you are getting all this good grades that you gain by yourself. Dhat is one of the best sensations that you can ever feel or experiment. Using my example again I can say that all the result of my hard work that I have done helping me to get good gains in my English developing.

Not matter how many times you fail the last feeling is best in the world. Because is the result of all your hard work. Sometimes I remember how hard was for me to star school in a different country, but when I see that I'm about to graduate and get my High School diploma it reminds me all the hard work that I have done during this almost 2 years that I have studying here in Generic_School.

It could sound bad when you hear the word failure or fail when you're trying to reach a goal, but if you think we should see all the forms that these words have. Success is not all about fail there is more. We have to go deeper into that words. As I said fail is a big and important part in the way to reach a goal. Success is a big process with branches and one of these branches is the failure. But failure give us more than we think. It gives us experience that could prepare us for future problems or future goals, it also prepares or improve your skill and even if you don't have one you could discover one that you didn't notice, and finally, but no less important the comfortable feeling that give you at the end is incredible because remind you all the hard work that you have done. So I think if you don

'T want to loss enthusiasm during the process of reach success you shouldn't see the word failure as it is you should go deeper in to try to understand the important role that it plays in the pursuit of success. I just mention three reasons here but there could be more than three just don't think that just because you fail is the end of the world instead see how failure could help you to reach that important goal your or success.

The Electoral College is a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The group of electors for your state are selected by the cnadidate""s political party. So when you vote for a specific candidate you are voting for the electors he is supported by.

So why do people want to aboplish the electoral college completely? Because there are some serious things wrong with it. ""perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote"" (Source 2, Paragraph 4). How can there be a tie in the election of the president? Perhaps because sometimes the electors get to thinking in another midset and vote for the wrong candidate...Yes that is poosible. When people vote for there candidate the electors are the ones being selected and aren't always the way they were in their chosing so therefore there can be a serious tip in votes if the electors don't vote for the candidate of the party they were selected by. ""In 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a diect election"" (Source 2, Paragrph 1). The people don't want the electoral college anymore, Who's to say they ever did?

But even know some don't want the electoral college there are some who prefer to keep it. ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and that trust is rarely betrayed"" (Source 3, Paragraph 2). So when the party selects their electors they are most likely to select the candidate of the party they were selected by. There is also regional appeal,if a president only has diserably mojority of vores in a certain region of the country he is ""unlikely to be a succesful president""( Source 3, Paragraph 5) . This is because if a president is only desired by a certain region and not the rest of the country, the wants of the rest of the country aren't met and he most likely will not tend to the needs of them, and ultimately doesn't have a chance of being selected as president. Finally, when no candidate for president has a clear majority of votes, the electoral college's votes gove a clear winner and a candidate is selected.

Concluding, both sides have reasonable arguments to if the elctoral college will stay for good or be abolished completely.

250769,,"Imagine being able to attend classes in the comfort of your own home. In fact, many individuals believe in the benefits of a student being able to attend classes from home. While it seems like a great idea for the students it's a downfall to their ability to learn and grow as an individual. Being able to attend classes from home would open the door for the possibilities of cheating, distractions, and slower social development of the individual.

One reason that attending classes from a place other than school is a bad idea is because it opens up the opportunity to be able to cheat. When at home who is there to be able to stop the student? Jany's individuals will find themselves intrigued with the idea of passing all their classes because they have all the resources right there in front of them. When doing classes at home there is no way to monitor the way that students learn the information or if they are even learning it at all. The ability to cheat skyrockets as soon as the option of distance learning is introduced. Having the benefit of being at home gives students the time to come up with answers that they might not know. Every student will look for an easy A and having the opportunity to take the classes from home makes the possibilities endless for that so-called ""prefect grade"".

In addition to cheating there is the aspect of distractions all around the individual. Any will say that their home is where they feel most comfortable. So in that case it goes to show that having the ability to learn at home, individuals will be faced with many challenging distractions. Being at home is like an invitation to a candy shop, so many options but what to choose? Will the individuals do their work, or will they decide to mess with their siblings, play with their dogs, make food, call a friend, go out, or do their work? With school work being the students number one priority, there will come many challenging decisions, but if they didn't have the ability to attend the classes from home then the distractions would decrease tremendously. Students already tend to struggle in the classroom environment so adding in the possible comfort of their home is really asking them to do the impossible. They won't be able to focus on school work or have the access to the tools that will make them most successful.

Lastly, when attending classes at home an individuals social development can be slower. Having the ability to interact with others on a daily basis is very important to the growth of ones social abilities. When working from home students have the ability to isolate themselves from others which slows their development down. Going to school allows individuals to interact with teachers and peers which helps them to develop who they are as a person. If an individual just sits at home all day and isolates them self then they won't develop their own character because it's as if they are just living in a bubble. When at home by themselves the students also don't get the communication skills needed to succeed in social development.

While on the other hand, some will say that in the comfort of their own home they will do better and have a greater chance of success. They believe that they can focus more in an environment where they are most comfortable. Individuals feel as if there is less pressure on them because they don't always have that figure standing over them as they would if they were in the classroom. While in reality ones home is too comfortable, and you need the constant nagging to be able to get done what needs to get done.

So in conclusion being at school and involved with the contact of everyday people is the best choice for an individual to succeed. Attending classes from home would only open up the possibilities of cheating, distractions, and slower social development.

305101,,"For centuries, EE have followed a certain system established by our founding fathers. This system is called the electoral college. This system is based off voting for the president through electoral votes rather than based off more popular. The state has an overall say through its electors. I believe that this system is unfair and should be abolished.

The electoral college should be abolished because you are not voting directly for the president. You are voting for an elector who would in turn elect the president. While you may end up pleased, others may feel the complete opposite. I believe that it is unfair to not directly vote for the president because it should be completely up to this nation to elect a president. The system they have set up right Noe is injustice.

The second reason the electoral college should be taken away is that the system has much room for failure. Electors could easily betray the all of the people. They have much more power than the standard voter. The electors would completely oppose the most ""popular"" vote and put in their vote for whoever they feel deserves it. This is wrong and totally goes against the idea of giving the people power. This would qualify as just giving a fee people power. There could also be room for a tie. This could result in the election ending in the hands of the House of Representatives their the state delegates could choose the president. Not only is this destroying the power of the public, but this could also result in people not getting that they wanted. The delegates could go completely against that the people say because they technically have the right to since they have the power of the situation.

The final reason the electoral college system should be left behind is the fact that not every state gets to see the candidates. Some of the smaller states that don't count for much of the vote or tend to lean towards a different party don't even get a visit from the candidates. Not only is that unfair, but it's also completely demanding towards the state. It makes the citizens of the state feel unworthy or not important enough for not even making an effort for their vote. This is also a stupid move on the candidates part because they might have been able to persuade the state's vote.

In conclusion, the electoral college is not a functional system for its characteristic of being completely indirect, for taking away the power of the people, and for its room for error. Although it may seem like a trustworthy system at first, don't be fooled.

In many schools districts offer programs that allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. This program make students to take classes that can help them to graduate on time, and many student take courses during the summers or in the evening. This is a bad idea making students to finish high school in three years. Because when students are try to graduate in three years, students may not be able to take elective course and student are no joy they last year of high school.

First, when students are try to graduate in three years, students may not be able to take elective course. For example, many students are interesting in elective courses, but they not got enough time to taking elective courses because they are take the basic courses for they can graduate on time. When students just take the basic courses they are not make progress in which courses they are interesting. In conclusion, students need four years in high school for they can take courses where they are interesting and they can start to grow up in that courses.

Secondly, student are not joy in they last year of high school. For example, school where are make student to graduate in three years, in they last year student have to take courses and SOL for they can graduate on time, if they dont past students most retake, and this make students frustrate. This program is making students to rush. But if they fail any classes that make students add more classes to they last year and all this make student to no joy they last year in high school. In conclusion, Last year for students don't have to be the worse year.

In other hand, there are people say, student just need three year in high school, for student can enter college or the work one year early. They argument, that student with three year are ready to graduate and enter college or the work, because many student may finish with their courses and SOL in their third year and the last year they don't do nothing. This argument is incorrect because in the four year students are doing what they need to finish and they planing where they wants to go if college or work. For example, students want to graduate on time, and they need to catch up or retake anything they can do it in the last year. In conclusion, student need a four year of high school for they can get anything what they have to be done.

In conclusion, put this program in school is a bad idea because make students to finish high school in three years.

When a voter places there vote they art voting for the actual president they are simply voting for the reps of the electoral college. ""The electoral college avoids the problem of elections IZ which ZO candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" What this means is that basically the election is based oz what they decide not oz what the people say.

Furthermore, the only thing the people do by voting is that they influence the electoral college's decision. The people dot really get to choose who they believe should be IZ office. All the electoral college does is get IZ the way of whom the people choose to be president. The electoral college should be removed AZD replaced with popular vote. This should take place as soon as possible.

Lastly, the people should have the right to vote for whom they believe should take office; not for some representative that is pizza choose who ever they wait. For example, let's say that one votes for Obama, they art really voting for Obama they are voting for someone who could pick Obama, But the person that they vote for to pick Obama could change there mid AZD vote for the other candidate. So really the peoples vote does even matter. All it does is influence the vote of some representative from the electoral college. I believe that this should be changed to popular vote. IZ which the people vote for the candidate they wait to be president AZD the all the votes are counted up AZD compared. That's the way the presidential should be dozed. This is the best way for the peoples voice to be recognized AZD it will make a difference.  ",0.0,"The problem with the electoral college is that the people really art controlling who they vote for.

Another reason why I think students should be required to do community service is for bad behavior or vandalize school property, and so they can learn that things like that won't help get the community better it will just Make it worse.

Another reason is that it would help the Men and women who have to clean and pick up trash every day.

The electoral college has a system that can be considered confusing to most americans. This system indirectly transfers citizen's votes to congress. This allows for loopholes and sabaotage to be commited during the process of electing a president.

I propose abolishing the electoral college and replacing it with a simpler system that appeals to all united states citizens instead of just certain citizens. Based on phrases in the passage, there is evidence that the electoral college system is corrupt. An example would be:

Back in 1960. segregationalists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in relpacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)

-source 2, second paragraph.

This is stating that in 1960 people who opposed Kennedy nearly became his electors. So if they succeeded in becoming his electors his votes would have gone to another opposing candidate. This could not happen with a system of voting that directly conected everyones votes with congress. This was a clear case of sabotage in the election of 1960.

Votes in larger states and smaller states are balanced out so the number of votes would not be based on the number of people in the states. This can be seen as a way to make sure that state votes did not compare to the population of said states. In reality it is limiting the votes of citizens. If people ignored how larger states had more people than smaller states and just thought of everyone as individuals everyone would have a say. The system I am proposing does not view states as the voters, but every american citizen as one. After everyone passed their votes, they would all be tallied and which ever candidate had the most votes would win.

You may think that the votes could be sabotaged, and that politicians could put in fake votes and get rid of real ones. This problem could be dealt with by maximized security. There would be videocameras wherever the votes could be swaped.

I propose this system to ensure that every citizen has a vote, and that corruption while transitioning the votes would be eliminated.

First, the image did have characteristics of a face. The text stated ""a few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see.

Secondly, the photograph that was captured in 1998 is more reliable and more efficient than the other one. This picture has a more clear view and is better to observe.

Gavin stated ""We had to roll the spacecrafts 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Main's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.""

Recently, Germany came up with the revolutionary idea to limit the use cars by forbidding street parking, driveways, and home garages in the new, experimental district of Vauban. Others have joined the bandwagon as well, instituting new laws, such as the ""Carefree Day"" in Bogotá, Colombia, and the partial driving ban in Paris, France. France, Germany, and Colombia are the predeceasing countries to the innovational car usage limitations. These limitations have many advantages, such as a decrease in pollution, traffic, and a long term positive culture shift.

Pollution and the emission of greenhouse gases is one of the common issues troubling countries worldwide. A limit of the use of cars and other various vehicles that run of fossil fuels has been proven to help counter the depletion of earth's Ozone layer. According to

Is this was of electing really all that fair? Does it let the entire population get a fair SAK in whom that want to run the country? While some people MAK argue that this system allows the people on the commit of electors that actually want to have their fair SAK in who becomes president, but first You need to think about; the whole American population barely has ANK SAK at all in the election, and we change this tradition.

It is time for a change, because when a United States citizen votes, the actually aren't even voting for president at all. The are merely voting for a commit of electors to elect the next president for them. Also, is the commit of electors that actually wins the elections, and not the popular vote. This is who the call this commit of electors the swing vote because You could win the popular vote bk 78.9 percent and still lose the election because You lost the commit of electors votes. This generic has happened a few times in our history. For instance in 2000 candidate Al Gore won there popular vote but lost the residence thanks to the commit of elections from the electoral college. Some people MAK argue that this is a long tradition in our country and must be kept. Yes this is true, but there are some very crucial factors against this.

I understand that this election process was put forth but our founding father and some people do not want to just throw it away. While I understand this; however, there are flaws in this process that must not be overlooked. It does not include and take into account the whole population, and it can lead some Canadian to lose even when the whole country voted for them.

This process does not include the entire count of the votes bk American citizens. It is like our thoughts and ideas of who should be president do not even matter in the voting process.

361010,,"To home this may concern the electoral college is outdated and unfair. Examples of this would be that bias can take up a big part of it. For example if an electoral does not like who is running for president on the winning side they can bend the votes into there favor. Another example would be in the case of a tie the election would be given to the house of representatives witch would be another unfair vote, because each representative stands for everyone in the state. So if the representative in MA was Democrat and the representative in TX was republican then the Morty vote would most likely go to the republicans.

Other examples of how unfair the system is the ""winner take all"" system. Reasons it is unfair is that the running candidates don't go to states if they no they are going to win or not. Some states don't even get to see the adds for some candidates because that stat Morty is either republic or Democrat. That is unfair to the people that are in the opposite party in that state. Father more the system is unfair to people in states where the Morty is something different from the party they are in.

Last but not least the system is outdated. The electoral college has been around since the construction was written but since then it has gone down hill with the bias and Morty votes. Examples of this can be found int the two paragraphs above as well as in this one. Another example why is outdated and unfair is the people most likely do not have a say in whom they pick. A reason for this would be the bias the members of the electoral have to a candidate. The vote they cast has a grater power over ours and can sway the vote to there favor is they want to. More reasons would be how the electoral college has been around since the construction. Although other systems from that time still seem to work this one does not, and it will continue to fail until it just stops working altogether.

Mn conclusion the electoral college needs to be changed due to the bias in the system along with the unfairness of the system. Also, the age of the system and the fact that it seems to keep failing, And not showing any signs that it will get better. Or help with elections in a fair and appropriate way. Later on in other elections.  ",0.0,"To home this may concern the electoral college is outdated and unfair. Examples of this would be that bias can take up a big part of it. For example if an electoral does not like who is running for president on the winning side they can bend the votes into there favor. Another example would be in the case of a tie the election would be given to the house of representatives witch would be another unfair vote, because each representative stands for everyone in the state. So if the representative in MA was Democrat and the representative in TX was republican then the Morty vote would most likely go to the republicans.

Other examples of how unfair the system is the ""winner take all"" system. Reasons it is unfair is that the running candidates don't go to states if they no they are going to win or not. Some states don't even get to see the adds for some candidates because that stat Morty is either republic or Democrat. That is unfair to the people that are in the opposite party in that state. Father more the system is unfair to people in states where the Morty is something different from the party they are in.

Last but not least the system is outdated. The electoral college has been around since the construction was written but since then it has gone down hill with the bias and Morty votes. Examples of this can be found int the two paragraphs above as well as in this one. Another example why is outdated and unfair is the people most likely do not have a say in whom they pick. A reason for this would be the bias the members of the electoral have to a candidate. The vote they cast has a grater power over ours and can sway the vote to there favor is they want to.

They then can hear different points of view as they hear where other people went wrong and their experiences in that time, and how to avoid that situation. This then allows them to assess the conflict and then do what most people described as helpful.

Cf you ask multiple people for their opinions on it then you can get many answers, or you can get a bunch of the same answers to help your point. For instance, if you are having problems with a girl, and you ask boys and girls what to do then they will give you different answers based on the fact that they have opposite views on the conflict. Girls will make it seem like you did wrong and will try to make you feel bad but when you ask ""the boys"" it makes it seem like you did no wrong and your girlfriend is mad about something else completely unrelated to that topic. But if you ask on a different topic to that thought, then you could get very, very different answers.

Like when you are going to get a brand-new pair of shoes, but then you don't know what to get, so you ask your friends. They then proceed and say, Barrel x Adidas Human Races, Checkerboard Vans, Old Stool Vans, Yeezy Boost 350, or some New Balance Running shoes. Who ever you ask on a huge topic then you are going to get a wide variety of answers, some which you most likely wouldn't want to hear because of your own opinion.

Ct could also be if you ask them which is their favorite sport, they could say, Baseball, Football, Soccer, Volleyball, Golf, Bowling, Swimming, Hockey, Boxing, WWE, Wrestling, Fishing, etc. With this amount of options it really makes it hard to get a straight answer from the people you ask.

Also, if you need help to a math problem, not everyone is going to get the same answer. People could get 130in, 126in, 134in, 100in, 167in, and so on. Cf you don't get any of these then you probably will try it yourself, so you can see what you got and see where everyone else went wrong.

People ask for advice, so they don't seem like they are absolutely stupid, and they are incorrect all the time. Advice is asked for when, asking out a girl, making food, playing a sport, mowing the lawn, etc. Advice is important because it helps people understand where they went wrong and how they can prevent someone else from going wrong.

Instead of just asking one person sometimes, people ask multiple people to get their thoughts on that issue.

One of the reasons why we should have this type of technology in classrooms is to read every student's expressions to see how their feeling today at school.

This piece of new technology can help prevent conflicts or in some bad situations where a student is feeling anger or distress. In paragraph 6, it states that"" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". This can help teacher teach better in class and help the student understand better if they feel them type of emotions.

The Racial Action Systems technology can be studied by students in the classrooms, they can study on themself to see how they are feeling today. They can see if their friends are happy or sad, that can just improve our social skills by trying to figure out why their friends or classmates are feeling these types of emotions. This can make us better people by communication with one another. This software should be used in classrooms, it will make our teachers teach better in their lessons, its will make students better in the classrooms because the teacher will know what is wrong weather your confused on the lesson the teachers will know, and they will help the students become better each day with this technology.

I think it will be a good idea to have this software in the classroom because not only will the students, teachers, and other members in the school will know what you're feeling, your own family members can see also how you are feeling today in the classroom as well. This can help improve the communication with their loved ones at home too. They can seek help if they really need it if parents see what the problem is weather if your child is feeling sad or just confused, teachers can make sure parents will be noticed to see what is the problem in their child.

I believe that we should not have the Electoral College no more. We are giving people false hopes that there vote counts when it really does not. We see on TV ads that we should vote and let our voices be heard but when in reality it is not. Didn't Lincoln once say ""A nation founded by the people for the people by the people...""  he was saying that we should let people have a a voice in everything that happens in America, but we can not even have a voice in who we wanted as president.

We give all the power to the Electoral College but not to the people. In 2000 Al Gore won the popular votes but lost the presidency. What type of system is this where we vote for who we want  but get who we do not want. What the whole reason to vote if the Electoral College vote is more important then our. Beside voting for the president we want we vote for the slate of electors who elect the president. We don't even know who these mysterious Electoral College are they can vote for a president just because he is in the Democratic Party,we have no ideas why.

In 2000 we had the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse when it came to Electoral College. ""Consider that state legislatures was technically responsible for the picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency. The people vote was not heard in that year,because they wanted Al Gore respresenting by the Democratic Party but we got Geroge W. Bush. I have never heard of a more unfair voting system before. Where were our rights the freedom of speech then, it was no where to be found. I feel that voting for who never we want should be in the Bill of Rights. So it okay to a gun for safety in our bag but itnot okay to vote for what we want.

On most basic level, the Electoral College is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all-system in each state. Some candidates do not spend that much time in states they know they have no chance of winning. In 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not get to see Geroge Bush or Al Gore these states were Rhodes Island with 3 electoral votes and South Carolina with 9 electoral votes. Candidates mostly only visit the states with the most like Florida with 29 and Texas with 38. They do not care about the other states they only care about who have the most electoral votes.

Each party selects slate of electoral they trust to vote for the party nominee and they have rarely been betrayed. It is could be true that the winner of electoral  vote will not win base off of the national popular vote. But it is most likely not to happen again like in 2000 when Al Gore had more popular votes then Bush. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. So no Electoral can have a solid favorite they must vote on who would most likely chance America for the better.

But if the Al Gore vs. Bush happen once what stop it for happening again the reason why it happen was because we had Electoral College so to stop it. We Must stop it.

Florida state Senator as much of a good idea it is to have at some point in time it will go wrong. All good things, have bad endings. So I think it better to stop it now before things for the wrongs like Americans just stop voting becasue we all know our votes do not mean a thing when it come to Electoral College votes.",0.0,"Dear Florida Senator,

Candidates mostly only visit the states with the most like Florida with 29 and Texas with 38. They do not care about the other states they only care about who have the most electoral votes.

Each party selects slate of electoral they trust to vote for the party nominee and they have rarely been betrayed. It is could be true that the winner of electoral  vote will not win base off of the national popular vote. But it is most likely not to happen again like in 2000 when Al Gore had more popular votes then Bush. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. So no Electoral can have a solid favorite they must vote on who would most likely chance America for the better.

But if the Al Gore vs. Bush happen once what stop it for happening again the reason why it happen was because we had Electoral College so to stop it. We Must stop it.

Florida state Senator as much of a good idea it is to have at some point in time it will go wrong. All good things, have bad endings. So I think it better to stop it now before things for the wrongs like Americans just stop voting becasue we all know our votes do not mean a thing when it come to Electoral College

The benefit of a student being in their own home is quite clear-cut. A person feels more comfortable in a place where they spent a majority if their time. I personally have taken an online course at home ANR being able to RO work on my couch was much easier than sitting in a classroom. The comfort of being in my home where I heir things the way I water them makes things feel easy. Learning when I was in a soft couch rather than a hard backer chair was quite different, but different in a good way. Again, from personal experience, taking a work loan seemed quite a bit more manageable when I was sitting at home. I was also able to get up at anytime to grab a snack of get a drink of water.

Not all people learn at the same pace. Some people just ten to pick up information quicker ANR some people near to take their time to absorb knowledge.

I personally learn quickly ANR Ron't near very much time to pick something up.

Being by oneself in a classroom with a teacher would be the best learning experience possible as one on one teacher is all about one person learning. There is no having to teach other students. While online classes are not entirely one on one, they RO have smaller numbers of students enrolled in them. For my online class there was only 9 students in my ""class"". In a traditional classroom the number of students for that same class may be up to 30. In a class of 30 the teachers' attention is river over a much greater number of students ANR not every student can get the help that they near. With the online class, a teacher can give students a more personalized teaching experience ANR can also revote more time to students. With the teacher helping them more, it is most likely that the student will perform better in class. In my class of 9, I was struggling with a certain assignment ANR I was able to vireo chat my teacher for 2 hours ANR understand the material. That would not be possibly in a traditional classroom because a teachers' attention would be retiring among multiple students who would near help.

In conclusion, students would greatly benefit from taking classes at home because it would allow for comfortable learning (as a student would be more comfortable at home), custom pace setting (rue to looser airlines), ANR personal teaching (because class size would be smaller).",0.0,"Could students learn more effectively from online courses ANR vireo conferencing? In my opinion, students would benefit from being able to take classes at home, it would allow them to feel more comfortable, learn at their own pace, ANR communicate concisely with teachers.

The benefit of a student being in their own home is quite clear-cut. A person feels more comfortable in a place where they spent a majority if their time. I personally have taken an online course at home ANR being able to RO work on my couch was much easier than sitting in a classroom. The comfort of being in my home where I heir things the way I water them makes things feel easy. Learning when I was in a soft couch rather than a hard backer chair was quite different, but different in a good way. Again, from personal experience, taking a work loan seemed quite a bit more manageable when I was sitting at home. I was also able to get up at anytime to grab a snack of get a drink of water.

I feel that it is way too dangerous for the people inside the car and the people around the car, especially if people are asleep inside the car when something goes wrong. If there is even the slightest malfunction while a person is not conscious, if a sensor goes out, then it could cause an accident and possibly lead to injury or death. I like that most states have banned the testing of computer driven cars, there are still a few that have not including: California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. That if there are accidents like said in the passage, who is held accountable? I think it is best to just stay away from the driverless cars.

In the passage, the cars that are being tested are not completely driverless yet. The passage said that the car can only do so much without a human, if there are accidents and work zones on the road then it needs a human to control it. According to the passage, General Motors has been working on things to get the driver's attention when the car needs a human, they have been developing driver's seats that will vibrate if in danger. Some of the other options that companies have considered is to have flashing light on the windshield and some other head sup displays. Another option is the idea where they have cameras watching the driver so that they know whether the driver is focused on the road.

My favorite part is that most states have the testing of computer driven cars banned, with a few that have not budged yet. I think this is a great idea because if it wasn't banned or made illegal then companies and manufacturers would be testing it everyone and possibly causing accidents. If a malfunction were to happen while a manufacturer was testing the car there is no idea on what could happen especially if they do not have a human in the car. The car could swerve off of the road and hit someone or crash into a building and explode! I hope that California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia come around and ban the testing too.

I believe that there shouldn't be driverless cars, there are to many things that can go wrong during a test of it. Mven if manufacturers believe that they have everything fixed with the car and release it to the public, one of the sensors could go out, and your car would lose sight on that side of the car.

I want to know why are you changing the policy for sports. Most children this day have about a C not a B because they are more focus on the sport then the grades. They work on school work after practice. They really don't have time to be studying with the rate there going they only want to play a sport. They might not be as good in school and only know how to play a sport and you're messing it up for them.

Just look into it and think about it. Or look at all the players grades and see what they have, it's not lower than a C so don't change the policy in till you see grades go up in to the B range. But really what you should be doing is having study hall for the kids to study before practice every other day for about three weeks or in till you see some grades go up and if that doesn't work who every isn't doing there work just kick them out of sport in till grades goes up.

If students use their phones in class then they don't pay much attention to their teachers. Students should know they can't use their cell phones in class.

I think students need to have their phones at school for example, in case of an emergency. Sometimes they need to contact someone to know when their leaving or going home. Without cell phones parents wouldn't know where their children are. Student sometimes need to make sure they can go over a friends house or just to let them know when they will be going home. If we use our phones on break then it wouldn't a disturbance to anyone. They can check the time or maybe just remind themselves of something they needed to do. On the other hand, having a phone in school isn't really a big deal.

If students have phones in class, and they are turned on then it will distract them. I think as long as the teacher is strict about having phones turned on in class then students wouldn't use them. If students know the rule about cell phones then they wouldn't use them unless their bored in their class and want something to do. If students are really paying attention and are interested in what they are doing then it shouldn't be a problem.

428110,,"People tend to ask more than one person at a time for advice because it can make them seem comfortable with their answer, but also there are so many ways people do this and there can also be a lot of ways why people would do this. Might now I'm going to show only some ways why and the different ways they do this, yet there would still be way too many reasons to write down right now.

One example that I can think about is when you're trying to spell a word in class. You might be thinking that you have spelled that one word wrong and want it to be confirmed that you're either right or wrong. The first thing you'll probably ask is your friend next to you, but you think that they spelled your word wrong too. You might ask another friend, yet that other friend still gets it wrong. After that I'm guessing your going to go ask your teacher that has more knowledge on spelling. You do this because you want to confirm that you were right and didn't trust yourself or had trouble with spelling that word. Now that you've asked more than one person you now know how to spell your word correctly.

There are so many times when you need someone else's opinion on a daily basis like, someone might ask if they like him or hers outfit today or ask if you liked what they cooked for dinner. They do this because they need clarification with you or need someone else's opinion to make them feel comfortable if they are questioning something about themself.

Some people may act independent, but I'm certain that they have asked for an opinion even if it's just something small. I mean that you probably ask for someone's opinion at least five times a day or if not more, usually we don't even think before saying it. When we ask for an input on what or how another person thinks I think is also a way to fit in. Just like following a trend we ask to stay updated, and so we make a normal decision.

Even just the way everyone thinks and acts differently is actually a big reason to why we ask for another persons' opinion. This is because if that one person has more knowledge on that one thing, there will be some people that will ask for there opinion on it, so they can have some more understanding about whatever it is that that person knows.

For example if someone is trying to learn how to skateboard (meaning they just started and aren't comfortable riding yet) and are trying to learn a new trick, they will probably practice a lot but if they are at the skate park with a friend they're going to ask there friend for some pointers on learning that new trick. Yet if you went with two of your friends one being perfect at skateboarding and knowing all the tricks and the other doesn't even own a skateboard. You would want to ask the one who knows how to skate but would probably end up asking both of your friends just for the sake of knowing more and go with the opinion with the friend you think helps the most.

People giving out their opinion to someone who needs it is a person who is always willing to help. When asking someone for their opinion they might not always give it to you which might be another reasons to why you have to ask other people. The main reason they probably won't give their opinion to you is because they are also unsure and don't want to give out the wrong information. Somebody else that doesn't know a lot about what your asking might just guess because they don't really know too much on what you're asking and at the end say ""but I don't know for sure"" which puts the person asking in an award situation and that's when they will ask somebody else.

I think the most popular reason why people ask more than one person is that they are unsure with one's opinion and need to confirm with different people, so they can make sure that they are final with their decision. These people probably will do this when it's important like when you're doing a school project. Yet they might do this because the first person they ask he or she might think they asked the wrong person because their answer was totally different from what they first got.

There are so many reasons to why we ask multiple people for an opinion some I haven't even explained because of all the possible ways to this subject that you can explain. In conclusion I think that asking different people for their opinion is good, so you can have more understanding and more clarification to know what another persons input is. ",0.0,"People tend to ask more than one person at a time for advice because it can make them seem comfortable with their answer, but also there are so many ways people do this and there can also be a lot of ways why people would do this.

415147,,"Though completely giving up the usage of your car seems life an extreme for most American citizens, it is a look in the right direction towards the future.

All over the world people are using less gas power and more leg power, riding bias, walking, skateboarding or even using public transportation, to lessen the air pollution caused by traffic.

The only information useful to made an explanatory essay for this topic is two sentences saying that"" After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city,"" but having this is only one reason Americans should cut down on their car usage, the environment, it doesn't mention any other way that it would help except for making a few people happy, fining 4,000 people 31 dollars for driving, and it would cut down traffic only slightly, because, buses would be on the road which, sure, could take up to 10 cars off the road, but if everyone stops using their cars and happen work in executive offices they will use the bus, not bicycles or skateboards only putting more busses on the streets and adding even more air pollution.

So I China I'll help beta test this essay writing test that SCHOOL_NAME was ""randomly selected"" for, but this prompt given with these writing selections, doesn't made any sense unless you wish a dull and dry essay with just regurgitated facts from the writing selections. So, here goes something.

In the state of STATE_NAME students from 3rd grade and up are all familiar with the infamous TEST_NAME, it was what was required for so many years and what we've all gotten used to. Once I personally hit middle school, we had midterms and finals for only one year, the following year they were removed, and we were given inter exams for every quarter to determine how much we were absorbing in the classroom. We were graded on these fairly, (not very heavily; 3 grades at the max.)

Up until about 8th grade I had never heard of an EOC, it was first introduced to me in my U.S. history class. We too a test that our teacher had formulated, and we all studied for weeks. I figured this would become apart from my high school life, and I wasn't wrong; 9th grade Geometry EOC, and a Biology EOC. It was dreadful, (since it was taken on a computer in a freezing computer lab, ) but we all survived because thankfully it was only for those two classes. After those two weeks of testing for the entire school it was fun and games and preparation for the challenges that were to come to our next year of schooling; for me this would be my relaxing yet exciting sophomore year.

Sophomore year had been going just fine up until one day in my French class we were informed that this year starting as early as January we would be tested with an EOC FOR EVERY CLASS! Students were confused, and a bit outraged at this new information. We asked hundreds of questions. ""What will they be on?"" ""Is the district making them?"" ""Are you serious!?"" Our teacher, (well-informed on what had seemed to be everything, ) anew of our fate to come; five months of overall testing occurring through our hallowed halls. We were baffled that classes life P. E, Art, Culinary, Fabrics and fibers and even Swimming would have end of course exams. What questions would they even ASA on these? How long has the district been planning this? Then she told us, ""We don't now what will be on them, all we now is that this test is created by teachers sending in questions to the district. The district is literally making it up as they go.""

All over the world people are using less gas power and more leg power, riding bias, walking, skateboarding or even using public transportation, to lessen the air pollution caused by traffic.

The only information useful to made an explanatory essay for this topic is two sentences saying that"" After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city,"" but having this is only one reason Americans should cut down on their car usage, the environment, it doesn't mention any other way that it would help except for making a few people happy, fining 4,000 people 31 dollars for driving, and it would cut down traffic only slightly, because, buses would be on the road which, sure, could take up to 10 cars off the road, but if everyone stops using their cars and happen work in executive offices they will use the bus, not bicycles or skateboards only putting more busses on the streets and adding even more air pollution.

So I China I'll help beta test this essay writing test that SCHOOL_NAME was ""randomly selected"" for, but this prompt given with these writing selections, doesn't made any sense unless you wish a dull and dry essay with just regurgitated facts from the writing selections. So, here goes something.

In the state of STATE_NAME students from 3rd grade and up are all familiar with the infamous TEST_NAME, it was what was required for so many years and what we've all gotten used to. Once I personally hit middle school, we had midterms and finals for only one year, the following year they were removed, and we were given inter exams for every quarter to determine how much we were absorbing in the classroom. We were graded on these fairly, (not very heavily; 3 grades at the max.)

Up until about 8th grade I had never heard of an EOC, it was first introduced to me in my U.S. history class. We too a test that our teacher had formulated, and we all studied for weeks. I figured this would become apart from my high school life, and I wasn't wrong; 9th grade Geometry EOC, and a Biology EOC. It was dreadful, (since it was taken on a computer in a freezing computer lab, ) but we all survived because thankfully it was only for those two classes. After those two weeks of testing for the entire school it was fun and games and preparation for the challenges that were to come to our next year of schooling; for me this would be my relaxing yet exciting sophomore year.

Sophomore year had been going just fine up until one day in my French class we were informed that this year starting as early as January we would be tested with an EOC FOR EVERY CLASS! Students were confused, and a bit outraged at this new information. We asked hundreds of questions. ""What will they be on?"" ""Is the district making them?"" ""Are you serious!?"" Our teacher, (well-informed on what had seemed to be everything, ) anew of our fate to come; five months of overall testing occurring through our hallowed halls. We were baffled that classes life P. E, Art, Culinary, Fabrics and fibers and even Swimming would have end of course exams. What questions would they even ASA on these? How long has the district been planning this? Then she told us, ""We don't now what will be on them, all we now is that this test is created by teachers sending in questions to the district. The district is literally making it up as they go.""

We asked many more questions full of confusion and rage. When she then realized they have only made one test so far, a Spanish test with no level. This test would be taken by Spanish speakers and Spanish learners all the same. This wasn't fair! It wasn't even comprehendable! We would be taking the same test as the French AP students!

Technology that can determine someone's emotions was once thought to be a thing of the future but now that future is here. Professor Thomas Huang has been able to create a computer algorithm that determines human emotions by scanning their facial expressions. Imagine the possibilities with such software!! The most beneficial area in which the computer algorithm could be used in is schools. '""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, ...

Software such as the type that Dr. Huang has created could improve test scores across the nation and ease the workload of thousands of teachers. Why not use it?

Hence, forth, technology that determines human emotions would be largely beneficial and effective for a large portion of the worlds' population.

By limiting car usage, we could prevent less car accidents/traffic jams, pollution/greenhouse gas, and we can get more exercise.

To begin with, pollution and the greenhouse effect are awful to the environment. Car exhaust and other gases are a big contributor to that. How do we do something to help that people ask? Well you can drive less and maybe walk or ride a bike. It will limit so many big issues if you just don't drive as much. Source 3, paragraph 24 businessman, Carlos Arturo Plaza says ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" You know what he did after he said that? He rode away in a 2 seater bike with his wife. That's a businessman, and even he doesn't have a problem riding his bike to work with his wife. You can do so much to save the earth. You, can make a difference. Furthermore, you don't have to be the hero, but you can sure do your part to help save the day.

In comparison, car accidents? They are the absolute worst. It not only affects 1 car, but it could affect 2 or 3. Maybe even more. Limiting car usage could prevent so many accidents and that means no more hospital visits. Source 2, paragraph 4 says ""Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France after 5 days of intensifying smog."" That means that there was 60 percent less traffic jams and accidents in 5 days! That's an amazing improvement. I always wished that people couldn't get hurt or that I could save someone's life, so that what I will try to do. Drive less, or drive only when it's needed. Don't love your car running. A big negative is don't speed and watch all around you. You can prevent killing someone, not just that, but you can decrease the amount of accidents that can happen. Don't make an as amine choice and drive because you feel like it. Help save this earth. It's really all we have left.

Lastly, you can get more exercise. Riding a bike and walking is a great source of exercising. Everyone always talks about how obesity is a big problem well this can decrease the amount of body weight you have and you won't put gases into the air. That's 2 problems solved in 1. There are so many things you can do to solve this issue and these are only a few. I see a lot of people riding bikes or walking to school. Teachers especially which shows you that they aren't always asking teenagers or new drivers to do it. Don't be the reason the earth is getting worse. Be the reason its getting better.

In conclusion, pollution is bad and so are accidents. But there is always a solution to the madness. You yourself can make a change. This earth can't take care of itself, it needs your help, so help it. Limiting the usage of your car is a great start. Yes, cars are great, and they get you from point A to point B, and they can warm you up when it's cool outside or cool you down when its hot, those are all true statements and that's fine it really is.

In my opinion we should abolish the electoral college because it's not fair to the people who vote, they vote on the president they want but Aden't actually voting for them? That's crazy we should be able to vote on whom we want, and it should be counted for. It makes everything much more complicated than it is. As it shows in these documents what would happen if a president won not because of popular vote but the amount of electoral votes.

Is it that that scaled of having a tie of votes? If that were to happen the election could go to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. What if the people don't like that elector? What if the elector chose one president because they wanted to?

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible, it happened in 200 but, It's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal.

No region has electoral cotes to elect president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the south has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.

The winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates as we saw in 2012's election. Voters in toss-up states are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign.

251071,,"In 1976 there was a mysterious face found on the planet Mars. I'm a scientist at NASA space station discussing some accusations about this face. Some people are beginning to believe that the face was created by aliens. However, that is not the case here. This mysterious face was simply created by natural causes and happens to just have distinct features of a human face.

My first reason as to why this face is a natural landform is because there is no scientific proof that aliens have ever existed on Mars, or anywhere else. If there is no proof of these aliens living then how could they have possibly been able to create such an artifact. Plus, believing that this was caused by natural causes is way more believable than relying on unproven research that aliens once existed.

My second reason to this being just a natural landform is scientists believe the nose, eyes, and mouth of the figure are created by shadows giving it an illusion of a human face. This attracted the public which is exactly what NASA wants. So, NASA is using the illusion of this human face to attract more attention to their program and Mars itself. Ry doing this it is making most people believe the face was created by aliens, which it in fact wasn't. Evidence of this is when the article, Unmasking the Face on Mars states, ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.""

My third and final reason this mysterious face is just a natural landform is that is resembles features of landforms common in American West. For example, Gavin states, ""It reminds me most of Middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,"" Gavin also says. If this face resembles American Western landforms so much then it must be a natural landform itself.

Although there are reasons this face wasn't created by aliens there are some conspiracies involving NASA. One is that people believe NASA has already found traces of life on Mars and would rather keep that seat from the public. This is believable because NASA wouldn't want to alarm the public of extraterrestrial lifeforms and create panic. Although it could create panic, NASA should want to inform the public because it could cause support of NASA and their findings instead. For example, people could start donating money to the company to help with further research and have more knowledge about what they do.

This mysterious face on the surface of Mars is no more than a natural landform. It was not caused by aliens because there is no scientific proof. NASA wants the public to believe it is a cause by aliens, so they could get more publicity for it. I mean, this face has already starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. It's had enough publicity and does not deserve any more because it is just a natural landform caused by natural changes, not aliens.",0.0,"In 1976 there was a mysterious face found on the planet Mars.

Whether it be as small as what to eat for lunch or as big as what job you want to have for the rest of your life, but some people try to get others opinions to help make these decisions. Getting opinions from other people to help make decisions can help with getting a different point of view , having more experience in a topic, and having more knowledge about a topic .

Something someone might have that you dont is a different point of view(POV). Someone else might view someone differently,whether it be a better or a worse POV. You might have seen this person as a good person all your life but your friend might think otherwise. Someone else also might think of somewhere differently because where the live or have been. For example, you might think Orlando, FL is great place to visit and have a good time at but someone who lives there might think its annoying with fireworks going off all the time. Someone else might think of times or events differently too. For example you might think December is the best time of the year with all the holidays and family but someone else might think its stressful to try and please everyone. If your trying to make an important decision, try to get someone else point of view, it might help you.

Another reason you might want to get advice from someone else is is they might have more experience in a topic than you . Someone might have been around different people more than you. This means they might have social skills than you or can talk in front of a crowd better than you. Someone might have been different or more places than you. This might make them better navigators or know more things about place than you. Someone else might know more than you by what they do or have done for living. For example, if you want to race cars when you grow up dont ask a plumber how to race cars, ask someone who has experience in that industry. If you need advice always to try to get it from someone who has more experience in the topic than you.

In my opinion the most important reason you should get advice from others is if they have more knowledge than you about the topic. Someone else might have know more about people and how that act more than you. getting advice from them might help decide who to associate yourself with. Someone else might also have gone to school for learning about a specific topic. If you are also interested in the same topic they went to school for it will definitely help getting advice from them than it will be from anyone else. Someone else might have more information about a place than you. They can help you decide where to take a vacation to, what to do or where to stay on vacation. Getting advice from someone who has more knowledge on the topic will definitely help you make the right decision.

I think getting advice from other people is great. it can help you get a different Point of view on someone or something, they might have more experience or exposure to a topic than you, and they might just have more knowledge than you on the topic.

Seeking advice from multiple sources is a good way to get advice because different people might have a different point of view, they could have prior experiences, or they could be of older age. I believe that seeking multiple opinions could help you more than just one.

Asking different people for advice is a good thing to do because people have different points of view. All people think differently, so getting different sources of advice is a lot better than one source of advice. Different people have different mindsets so, lots of people have a very good and positive mindset, and they are the people you want to listen to more. Some people also have a negative mindset, and they might thank on the downside of things but, sometimes they could have perfect advice on things. Lots of people have many points of view on things.

When getting sources the best sources are the ones who have prior experience with what you are seeking advice for. If you decide to chose someone who has been through the same path, it would be a good idea to get advice from someone who chose the right thing to do in the position that you are in. It would also be a good idea to get advice from a source who chose the wrong path and have suffered the consequences and know how important it is for you to choose the good path. It would also be a good idea to get advice from a source who has done something similar to what you are looking for advice for, because they might have a little way to make it easier. Getting advice from people with prior experience is a very reliable way to make a good choice on things.

There are a lot of kids in this school that like to play sports. They want to be basketball, football, and even baseball players. Without sports in school kids are just going to not caring about school and some might even drop out because some kids try to impress girls with there ability to play sports. Many of us kids think that it is unfair to only let kids with a ""B"" average to play. I think you should let us play with a c average because we are probably one of the few schools that like sports and have higher than a failing grade.

I have heard that some kids will try to pick up there grade just to be on the basketball team or football team. Furthermore, I know that kids need sports, some to let out there feeling, some to let there energy out. You need to have sport because some kids like to stay fit and have a six-pack. Some kids might not like any kinds of sport and might like to have like a rocket ship building class or like a baking class. Some kids are just interested in making beats or drawing. I know a lot of kids that like to stay fit just to impress the women how they look. Maybe you can make clubs like 4H or FFA.

You never know if your school will have a hall of fame or its own trophy room.",0.0,"Dear Principal,

There are a lot of kids in this school that like to play sports. They want to be basketball, football, and even baseball players. Without sports in school kids are just going to not caring about school and some might even drop out because some kids try to impress girls with there ability to play sports. Many of us kids think that it is unfair to only let kids with a ""B"" average to play. I think you should let us play with a c average because we are probably one of the few schools that like sports and have higher than a failing grade.

I have heard that some kids will try to pick up there grade just to be on the basketball team or football team. Furthermore, I know that kids need sports, some to let out there feeling, some to let there energy out. You need to have sport because some kids like to stay fit and have a six-pack. Some kids might not like any kinds of sport and might like to have like a rocket ship building class or like a baking class. Some kids are just interested in making beats or drawing. I know a lot of kids that like to stay fit just to impress the women how they look. Maybe you can make clubs like 4H or FFA.

I understand that it will cost money but I can tell you that you will not regret having sports or other activities.

I think all students should be required to perform community service. Community services should help to teach them responsibility and show them how Food it feels inside when you were able to help someone.

Community services can help all students learn responsibility by helping out or taking care of others. For example, if a student had to help out at an animal shelter, they would learn how to take care of animals and the responsibility that comes with it so that when they bet their own pet they would know how to take care of it. And if their pet ever bets sick they would know what to do to help that animal.

Spending time on community services can also five you the joy of helping out. I remember a time when I was helping my little cousin with his math homework, and I helped him understand how to do the problems he was so excited he couldn't wait until his mom came home, so he could show her that he understood them. It wasn't community service but I loved the feeling of band able to help him understand, so he could bet better at it and possibly brow up to do something with his life involving the subject that I helped him with.

225796,,"""HEY, WHAT TO I NEED TO DO!"".

People often attain confusion, but why be brain stumped just ask friends, family, or even your coworkers for their opinion. It is excellent to ask a question if you cannot decide what to do, but you do not have to be embarrassed just because you asked a question. You never access knowledge unless you ask a question. There are three reasons why you need to ask for multiple opinions you can have a variety of choices to choose from, you do not have to make an poor decision that will leave you with a lifetime flaw, and if an plan that you tried multiple times fails, you will always have a backup plan.

First, the idea of having multiple choices is an excellent idea. It's similar to deciding what restaurant you crave, Longhorn Steakhouse or Outback Steakhouse. Longhorn may attain lower prices, but Outback attains outstanding quality. Also, having multiple choices endures the responsibility of constructing your own choices. Choices are based off of assumptions and also what ones' reactions are, one is more remarkable than the other, that one has a more outstanding design, or this one has an astronomical quality. Choices are difficult to make, but they will not kill you.

Secondly, making poor decisions can always be costly, somehow and someway. Constructing an poor decision is either going to finish outstanding or in an extreme consequence, think of it as your going to end up in Heaven or Hell. Heaven, finishing outstanding, is going to be an excellent life, while Hell, finishing in an extreme consequence, is not going to turn out so excellent. When having multiple opinions make sure you decide on the correct opinion and not the one that will strand you on an island.

Finally, it is always excellent to have a backup plan. When your primary idea, plan A, does not always have an excellent ending make sure you have an intermediate plan, plan B, in reach. You will not always finish first in life, but as long as you attain an excellent backup plan, you will have an excellent chance of doing so.

Think of it as Trump, every time he fails he has another plan just in grass.

In conclusion, it is an excellent idea to have more than one opinion on board. It may never work out the way you wanted it to, but that is how life is, not fair. Just make sure you have another opinion in grass, just like Trump. Yet, choices are tough, bitter, or disastrous, but as long as there are multiple opinions we will make it through life.",0.0,"""HEY, WHAT TO I NEED TO DO!"".

Heaven, finishing outstanding, is going to be an excellent life, while Hell, finishing in an extreme consequence, is not going to turn out so excellent. When having multiple opinions make sure you decide on the correct opinion and not the one that will strand you on an island.

Finally, it is always excellent to have a backup plan. When your primary idea, plan A, does not always have an excellent ending make sure you have an intermediate plan, plan B, in reach. You will not always finish first in life, but as long as you attain an excellent backup plan, you will have an excellent chance of doing so.

Think of it as Trump, every time he fails he has another plan just in grass.

In conclusion, it is an excellent idea to have more than one opinion on board. It may never work out the way you wanted it to, but that is how life is, not fair. Just make sure you have another opinion in grass, just like Trump. Yet, choices are tough, bitter, or disastrous, but as long as there are multiple opinions we will make it through life.",2477,0.107,0.701,0.192,0.9954,0.6373263888888888,68.91,8.4,29.099496841430664,"['""HEY,', 'WHAT', 'TO', 'I', 'NEED', 'TO', 'DO!"".\n\nPeople', 'often', 'attain', 'confusion,', 'but', 'why', 'be', 'brain', 'stumped', 'just', 'ask', 'friends,', 'family,', 'or', 'even', 'your', 'coworkers', 'for', 'their', 'opinion.', 'It', 'is', 'excellent', 'to', 'ask', 'a', 'question', 'if', 'you', 'cannot', 'decide', 'what', 'to', 'do,', 'but', 'you', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'to', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'just', 'because', 'you', 'asked', 'a', 'question.', 'You', 'never', 'access', 'knowledge', 'unless', 'you', 'ask', 'a', 'question.', 'There', 'are', 'three', 'reasons', 'why', 'you', 'need', 'to', 'ask', 'for', 'multiple', 'opinions', 'you', 'can', 'have', 'a', 'variety', 'of', 'choices', 'to', 'choose', 'from,', 'you', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'to', 'make', 'an', 'poor', 'decision', 'that', 'will', 'leave', 'you', 'with', 'a', 'lifetime', 'flaw,', 'and', 'if', 'an', 'plan', 'that', 'you', 'tried', 'multiple', 'times', 'fails,', 'you', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'a', 'backup', 'plan.\n\nFirst,', 'the', 'idea', 'of', 'having', 'multiple', 'choices', 'is', 'an', 'excellent', 'idea.', ""It's"", 'similar', 'to', 'deciding', 'what', 'restaurant\xa0you', 'crave,', 'Longhorn', 'Steakhouse', 'or', 'Outback', 'Steakhouse.', 'Longhorn', 'may', 'attain', 'lower', 'prices,', 'but', 'Outback', 'attains', 'outstanding', 'quality.', 'Also,', 'having', 'multiple', 'choices', 'endures', 'the', 'responsibility', 'of', 'constructing', 'your', 'own', 'choices.', 'Choices', 'are', 'based', 'off', 'of', 'assumptions', 'and', 'also', 'what', ""ones'"", 'reactions', 'are,', 'one', 'is', 'more', 'remarkable', 'than', 'the', 'other,', 'that', 'one', 'has', 'a', 'more', 'outstanding', 'design,', 'or', 'this', 'one', 'has', 'an', 'astronomical', 'quality.', 'Choices', 'are', 'difficult', 'to', 'make,', 'but', 'they', 'will', 'not', 'kill', 'you.\n\nSecondly,', 'making', 'poor', 'decisions', 'can', 'always', 'be', 'costly,', 'somehow', 'and', 'someway.', 'Constructing', 'an', 'poor', 'decision', 'is', 'either', 'going', 'to', 'finish', 'outstanding', 'or', 'in', 'an', 'extreme', 'consequence,', 'think', 'of', 'it', 'as', 'your', 'going', 'to', 'end', 'up', 'in', 'Heaven', 'or', 'Hell.', 'Heaven,', 'finishing', 'outstanding,', 'is', 'going', 'to', 'be', 'an', 'excellent', 'life,', 'while', 'Hell,', 'finishing', 'in', 'an', 'extreme', 'consequence,', 'is', 'not', 'going', 'to', 'turn', 'out', 'so', 'excellent.', 'When', 'having', 'multiple', 'opinions', 'make', 'sure', 'you', 'decide', 'on', 'the', 'correct', 'opinion', 'and', 'not', 'the', 'one', 'that', 'will', 'strand', 'you', 'on', 'an', 'island.\n\nFinally,', 'it', 'is', 'always', 'excellent', 'to', 'have', 'a', 'backup', 'plan.', 'When', 'your', 'primary', 'idea,', 'plan', 'A,', 'does', 'not', 'always', 'have', 'an', 'excellent', 'ending', 'make', 'sure', 'you', 'have', 'an', 'intermediate', 'plan,', 'plan', 'B,', 'in', 'reach.', 'You', 'will', 'not', 'always', 'finish', 'first', 'in', 'life,', 'but', 'as', 'long', 'as', 'you', 'attain', 'an', 'excellent', 'backup', 'plan,', 'you', 'will', 'have', 'an', 'excellent', 'chance', 'of', 'doing', 'so.\n\nThink', 'of', 'it', 'as', 'Trump,', 'every', 'time', 'he', 'fails', 'he', 'has', 'another', 'plan', 'just', 'in', 'grass.\n\nIn', 'conclusion,', 'it', 'is', 'an', 'excellent', 'idea', 'to', 'have', 'more', 'than', 'one', 'opinion', 'on', 'board.', 'It', 'may', 'never', 'work', 'out', 'the', 'way', 'you', 'wanted', 'it', 'to,', 'but', 'that', 'is', 'how', 'life', 'is,', 'not', 'fair.', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', 'you', 'have', 'another', 'opinion', 'in', 'grass,', 'just', 'like', 'Trump.', 'Yet,', 'choices', 'are', 'tough,', 'bitter,', 'or', 'disastrous,', 'but', 'as', 'long', 'as', 'there', 'are', 'multiple', 'opinions', 'we', 'will', 'make', 'it', 'through', 'life.']",16,156,18.083333333333332,54,4

Knowing how a person is feeling by technology is very valuable because it's a very interesting process to be a part of, it also teaches many people about technology and learning about the action unit of a person, lastly, It's just a very fun job to do and a perfect way to learn about the human face reactions.

First, being able to tell how a person is feeling with technology is a very interesting job/thing to do. The software is the latest innovation form Prof with makes it very interesting to work on just became it's the latest and not many people get to use it. Being able to tell a persons emotions by technology also benefits the person by meaning all the expert and better ways in developing for humans and computers to communicate.

Next, the Facial Action Coding System is not only a fun thing to do, but it can also benefit a lot by learning any different ways to use technology. Many people may also learn about all types of computers that are able to tell the face expansions of a person. Not only that the person can learn all the different types of like human face muscles. A person could also learn the 6 basic emotions.

Finally, Being able to tell a persons emotions may get very fun to do. For example, In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Pick D'Slot shows how The Mona Lisa was a very fun iterating to bring a smile on a persons face. In the article the authors give an example of how they were able to tell how Mona Lisa is feeling in her port rate. He found out that Mona lists smile was not real and how she faked it. Although it might be a very fun thing to do it might also not be the best because some people can be emotional and not be Abe to take AMD figure out how a person might be feeling.

In conclusion, being able to be a part of The Facial Action Coding System is a very fun interesting job to do.

70219,,"Classes online sound like a good idea, I'm agree with this idea, but I,m also disagree for some negative reasons and problems, I also thing the best way to learn is the classic way, going to the school, so the reasons to why I'm agree with it, can be the easy way to have more attendance of the students, because some students lose their buses, wake up late, get sick or also they wake up tire because they also have jobs and don't go to school for that reason, also it can increase some students grades for attendances, and with the online classes they don't gonna have that attendance problems, it also positive for those students who work, because they don't have to worried for their schedules, or worried for their enegy for the day, and i'm also agree, because me as a student in some way fell more confortable study at home; those are my reasons to why I'm agree, but I'm also disagree for some others things, like the students who have problems to learn, some students needs some one to help them in some problems of the class or about other theme and it's more hard for the teacher to explain something specific from a computer, and it's more easy to explain at school, in person;

I would appreciate policy one. Sometimes we need our cell phones in case of emergency's and things happening at home. I think cell phones would really help schools now to keep kids focused.

Deciding whether to change the school policy will be difficult for you, I'm sure. I am a student athlete, obviously you would expect me to ask you to keep the policy the same. But, I know changing the policy and making everyone strive and try to make a B average would be a good choice. On the other hand, some athletes like myself are actually trying to get good or at least average grades. Sometimes a C average is the best we can do for that quarter or semester. After working out, practicing multiple sports each season, games, traveling, giving the school a good short reputation, then trying to fit in homework when we're dead tired is hard for most of us. Wouldn't it be hard for you, too?

Schoolwork to some students is easy. For those students who get a 4.0, 4.2, or 4.5 are using this time as an eighth grader to get ahead of everyone in freshman year. Then, you have some students who have the average grades or the B and C grades, most likely they won't do so well in high school, meaning they get no kind of academic scholarships for college. But, if the same person that had those low B and C grades was great in sports, they have a chance to get to college or even just have a good high school athletic career. Changing the policy can mess with their futures. Now, is a crucial time for that athlete with the solo grades to get ahead in his/her athletics, just like the student with the 4.2 GPA is ore oaring himself for high school.

In conclusion, please keep the policy as it is. Let those athletes have a chance for greatness, changing that policy would be harder than you think on us. I home I could have influenced your choice even a little, or helped you understand the daily life of a student athlete. Thank you for your time.

This will not only educate students what they need to review, but also the new expectations and allow them a preview on the types of assignments the individual teacher assigns. Summer assignments should be teacher designed to educate students on what is to be expected in the following year.

Over the summer, students have a tendency to forget information they learned in the past year(s). Summer assignments allow for students to still have time off from school, but also insure they are still learning and not loosing information needed in their next school year. By making the project teacher designed, the educator can make sure the project is outlining previously taught tools, information, and possibly new skills they will need in their class in the fall; something that may potentially be missed or not fully applied if student design their own projects.

Expectations and types of assignments/projects vary from teacher and year. The purpose of summer assignments should be not only to make sure students are still learning and retaining information, but to also give the student a preview of the teachers teaching/assignment style, level of difficulty of the class, and grading rubric. This way, it benefits the student in more way than one and completely prepares them for the class expectations of the following year. Therefore, it is essentially the teacher themselves designs the project for the benefit of the student in all such elements.

Some may disagree that the individual student should design their own summer project because it insures the student is learning while getting some enjoyment and individuality. However, if the students themselves design the project, it is not guaranteed they will apply information and tools vital for next year. Even if they are given a rubric specifically outlining the Jessica elements needed within the project, the assignment will still be lacking an example of the types of projects the teacher is likely to assign in the future, the teachers educating style, and will not visit the true difficulty of the class. The student will still be able to show their personality through their work within the teacher designed project, so it will still display individuality; but at the same time preparing them for the teachers class specifically.

Summer projects are helpful in the fact it assures students are still learning over break, but if exclusively the teacher designs it can simultaneously also be very helpful in outlining previously taught tools/ information they need in the following year, teacher and class expectations, as well as displaying both teacher and student personality. Summer assignments should be teacher designed to educate students on what is to be expected in the following year.  ",0.0,"Teachers exclusively should design summer assignments to apply tools and characteristics Jessica to review or learn in the upcoming year.

Over the summer, students have a tendency to forget information they learned in the past year(s). Summer assignments allow for students to still have time off from school, but also insure they are still learning and not loosing information needed in their next school year. By making the project teacher designed, the educator can make sure the project is outlining previously taught tools, information, and possibly new skills they will need in their class in the fall; something that may potentially be missed or not fully applied if student design their own projects.

Also with school apps we can email our teachear. Students think thats one good reason to use or phones with education.

Cellphones are small and they still have it all. Rigth now students are using computer wich it harder because it makes our backpacks heavier, why dont we replacet them for a phone. Its beneficial for us. If we the students could handle a computer, we can handle a phone. Some people think that migth be a good option.

Cell phones have more facility to get into stuff. In cell phones everithing its abvaible, that means we can found a lot of stuff.. Definitions, apss, movies about education ect. To be abvaible to everithing its something beneficial for us. .Sometimes we need to watch and old movie and the teacher dont find it but if we have the cell phones everiyone would watching it separly. Cell phones are a good thing for the education.

Theres people that think that cellphones are a bad thing to the education. They think its not rigth to have a phe out in class. Some people think that cell phones are too avaible. They think they are distractive. They think its not the same think as a computer.

we see the two parts of this, one part its showing that we need phones and they are easier for and the other part its showing that they are a bad option. We

Students think we should have them. School should let us have them in class. Basicly phones and computers are the same thing. We can handle it.",1949,0.039,0.904,0.057,0.4053,0.39880952380952384,85.39,4.2,51.028194427490234,"['Some', ""school's"", 'use', 'cell', 'phones', 'for', 'education.', 'In', 'Some', ""school's"", 'cell', 'phones', 'are', 'not', 'allow.', 'We', 'the', 'students', 'think', 'that', 'cell', 'phones', 'are', 'a', 'good', 'and', 'usefull.', 'Cell', 'phones', 'have', 'internet', 'and', 'we', 'can', 'do', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'our', 'work', 'with', 'it.', 'A', 'cell', 'phone', 'its', 'like', 'a', 'computer.', 'The', 'students', 'think', 'that', 'we', 'should', 'use', 'cell', 'phones', 'in', 'education.\n\nCell', 'phones', 'have', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'apps.', 'The', 'apps', 'are', 'easier', 'to', 'handle', 'in', 'a', 'cell', 'phone', 'that', 'in', 'a', 'computer.', 'We', 'the', 'students', 'already', 'have', 'apps', 'for', 'our', 'cell', 'phones', 'were', 'we', 'can', 'see', 'our', 'grades', 'and', 'school', 'calendar.', 'Also', 'with', 'school', 'apps', 'we', 'can', 'email', 'our', 'teachear.', 'Students', 'think', 'thats', 'one', 'good', 'reason', 'to', 'use', 'or', 'phones', 'with', 'education.\n\nCellphones', 'are', 'small', 'and', 'they', 'still', 'have', 'it', 'all.', 'Rigth', 'now', 'students', 'are', 'using', 'computer', 'wich', 'it', 'harder', 'because', 'it', 'makes', 'our', 'backpacks', 'heavier,', 'why', 'dont', 'we', 'replacet', 'them', 'for', 'a', 'phone.', 'Its', 'beneficial', 'for', 'us.', 'If', 'we', 'the', 'students', 'could', 'handle', 'a', 'computer,', 'we', 'can', 'handle', 'a', 'phone.', 'Some', 'people', 'think', 'that', 'migth', 'be', 'a', 'good', 'option.\n\nCell', 'phones', 'have', 'more', 'facility', 'to', 'get', 'into', 'stuff.', 'In', 'cell', 'phones', 'everithing', 'its', 'abvaible,', 'that', 'means', 'we', 'can', 'found', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'stuff..', 'Definitions,', 'apss,', 'movies', 'about', 'education', 'ect.', 'To', 'be', 'abvaible', 'to', 'everithing', 'its', 'something', 'beneficial', 'for', 'us.', '.Sometimes', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'watch', 'and', 'old', 'movie', 'and', 'the', 'teacher', 'dont', 'find', 'it', 'but', 'if', 'we', 'have', 'the', 'cell', 'phones', 'everiyone', 'would', 'watching', 'it', 'separly.', 'Cell', 'phones', 'are', 'a', 'good', 'thing', 'for', 'the', 'education.\n\nTheres', 'people', 'that', 'think', 'that', 'cellphones', 'are', 'a', 'bad', 'thing', 'to', 'the', 'education.', 'They', 'think', 'its', 'not', 'rigth', 'to', 'have', 'a', 'phe', 'out', 'in', 'class.', 'Some', 'people', 'think', 'that', 'cell', 'phones', 'are', 'too', 'avaible.', 'They', 'think', 'they', 'are', 'distractive.', 'They', 'think', 'its', 'not', 'the', 'same', 'think', 'as', 'a', 'computer.\n\nwe', 'see', 'the', 'two', 'parts', 'of', 'this,', 'one', 'part', 'its', 'showing', 'that', 'we', 'need', 'phones', 'and', 'they', 'are', 'easier', 'for', 'and', 'the', 'other', 'part', 'its', 'showing', 'that', 'they', 'are', 'a', 'bad', 'option.', 'We\n\nStudents', 'think', 'we', 'should', 'have', 'them.', 'School', 'should', 'let', 'us', 'have', 'them', 'in', 'class.', 'Basicly', 'phones', 'and', 'computers', 'are', 'the', 'same', 'thing.', 'We', 'can', 'handle', 'it.']",13,87,10.17142857142857,20,2

In 2016, Tesla is planning to release a car that can drive itself 90 percent of the time.

The kind of high tech equipment it takes to manufacture a car like this hasn't been around for long.

Google has had a type of driverless car since 2009, but before 2000, none of this was possible.

With this rapid advance in technology comes reasonable concern, but the long list of benefits clearly outweighs the costs.

Because of the added safety features and convenience, driverless cars should be developed for all to use.

Driverless cars may seem like a safety risk to some, but in reality, these cars have been enhanced with topoftheline technology and have been tested thoroughly.

Google's driverless car uses many sensors and cameras located all over the vehicle to replicate the ability of a human driver.

One sensor even allows for the creation of a 3D model of the car's environment.

Sensors similar to these have been used in cars since the 1980s in antilock brakes.

Tried and tested, all the sensors on driverless cars serve only to protect the driver.

Driverless cars can also prevent distracted driving.

Some companies hope to create entertainment systems for drivers not currently controlling the car.

These systems and displays could be turned off right away when the driver has to take the wheel.

Right now, drivers often use cellphones and other distracting devices without the help of this technology.

As Google's cars have driven over half a million miles without a single crash, the combination of all these features has been proven to enhance car safety.

Driverless cars would also be cost effective, environmentally friendly, and convenient.

Google cofounder Sergey Brin predicts that these cars could form an entire public transportation system, using only half the fuel of today's taxis.

This would save gas money and reduce greenhouse gases at the same time.

It would also allow for more flexibility than a bus or subway system because each driver would be able to personalize their destination.

The economic and environmental benefits, along with the convenience, show why these cars could serve to enhance society.

Convenience and safety are the two most important aspects of transportation.

Driverless cars have both, along with environmental and economic benefits.

These cars are a part of the future, enhancing the driving experience for all.
